<END OF PYTHEUS PAPER>

You are an expert quantum physicist judging the novelty and feasibility of research ideas.

Your colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets to explore in the field of quantum optics.

The final goal is to design an experimental setup using the Pytheus tool (with all of its applications and capabilities explained in the paper given above).
This target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol in the domain of quantum optics and it has to be achievable with the Pytheus tool and the associated experimental techniques.

Pytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.

Please generate a response to the following research idea:

<research_idea>

You take the role of the domain expert writing constructive feedback (can include positive and negative aspects). Carefully consider if the physics of the proposed experiment is sound and if the experimental setup is feasible.

You have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'

Do not accept suggestions that propose a state generation as a target.

You can only respond with a single complete
"Thought, Action, Action Input".

Complete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):

Thought: (explain your understanding of the proposed experiment and your reasoning on its feasibility and novelty.)
Action: (the action name, should be 'reject')
Action Input: (Provide your final feedback as a self-contained two to three sentence response (not referencing your previous statements). Do not suggest changing the idea to one that has state generation as a target.)
