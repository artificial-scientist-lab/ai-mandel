In this example we create a heralded Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.

In this case the second target photon always starts off in mode 0.

If the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.
If the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.

We express this transformation in the key word 'target_state'.

We can read the value for 'target_state'

    "000000" means |000> -> |000>
    "010010" means |010> -> |010>
    "100100" means |100> -> |100>
    "110101" means |110> -> |101>

the value for the keyword 'in_nodes' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.

the value for the keyword 'out_nodes' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.

This transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.

We can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):

incoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]
setup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]
detectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]

The keyword "number_resolving" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.

We set "heralding_out" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click. The threshold parameters (under "thresholds") and other entries (such as "bulk_thr", "loss_func", "optimizer", and "tries_per_edge") govern the optimization process.
