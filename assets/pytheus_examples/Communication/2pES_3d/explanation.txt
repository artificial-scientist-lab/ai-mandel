In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.
This means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D
We want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.

Psi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)

The resulting target state is

Psi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)

The setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.

The setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.

There should be no common source between the two parties. In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both
A&C -> [0,2]
A&D -> [0,3]
B&C -> [1,2]
B&D -> [1,3]

This would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.

The reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.

By creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.
