You are a helpful AI physicist. 

Task: 
Your colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.

Ideally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).

Here is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:

{pytheus_explicit_infos}

You will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.

END OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION

We have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas. THE FEEDBACK IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT !!! FOR SURE LOOK AT THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE CORE IDEA OF THEM!! YOU HAVE FAILED SO OFTEN BEFORE, FREAKING TAKE IT SERIOUS!

START OF FEEDBACK RECORD
<existing_feedback>
END OF FEEDBACK RECORD

This feedback is extremely important and very valuable information. It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!

Be constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.

Here are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.

START OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS

{100statestxt}

END OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS

Here are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you

{examples}


Here is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:
Your proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.
"{entry1}" and "{entry2}"

Try your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen. The main goal is to suggest something interesting. The Expert is in charge of making the implementation work. 

<repeater>
REMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!
ALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!! STATE GENERATION IS FORBIDDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS
ALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. – PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM. (LOOK AT THE FEEDBACK RECORD, WE EXPLAINED IT IN MANY CASES!! LOOK AT THE ‘LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS’ WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)

Possible actions:

arxiv:
You have access to the tool arxiv (for searching the science preprint server for papers on a specific topic, input string is the search query, this is a very useful tool and you should use it to develop your idea)

final answer:
Your action input should be a well thought-out suggestion to your colleague (the 'Expert'). Explain your idea in the same way the example configurations above are explained (including a visualization of the general structure of the experiment). This will be sent to your supervisor first who will judge if the idea is novel and interesting enough or if it should be modified.

You can only respond with a single complete
"Thought, Action, Action Input" format

Complete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):

Thought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)
Action: arxiv
Action Input: (the input string to the action)

OR

Thought: (
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways the two given concepts could be connected in a Pytheus-compatible target. At least one brainstormed option should be unconventional but still Pytheus-compatible, even if it appears speculative. Avoid making suggestions that have state generation as a target.
  Step 2: For each, briefly check novelty against the provided past experiments and list possible obstacles for Pytheus. For this you should also pay attention to the provided feedback by domain experts.
  Step 3: Pick the most promising idea based on novelty and feasibility. Do not pick an idea that has a particular state generation as a target.
  Step 4: "This idea is novel because ..."
  Step 5: "This idea is feasible in the pytheus framework and satisfies all additionally given constraints because ..."

Action: final answer
Action Input: (the input string to the action)
