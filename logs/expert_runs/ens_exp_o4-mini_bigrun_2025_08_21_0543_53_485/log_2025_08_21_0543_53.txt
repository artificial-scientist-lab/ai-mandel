    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1. Sources:\n  \u2022 Pair source 1 emits |\u03a6\u207a\u3009\u208dA,B\u2080\u208e  \n  \u2022 Pair source 2 emits |\u03a6\u207a\u3009\u208dC\u2080,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 Single-photon emitter produces ancilla photon E\n\n2. Scattering & Wavefront Shaping:\n  \u2022 Photon B\u2080 \u2192 U\u2081 \u2192 programmable multiport W\u2081  \n  \u2022 Photon B\u2080 (via a fixed 50:50 BS in the same network) \u2192 U\u2082 \u2192 programmable multiport W\u2082  \n  \u2022 (We split B\u2080 into two spatial sub-modes across U\u2081, U\u2082\u2014BS is static.)  \n  \u2022 Similarly, photon C\u2080 is split and routed through the two channels U\u2081, U\u2082 and shaped by the same W\u2081, W\u2082 network.\n\n3. Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1. Sources:\n  \u2022 Pair source 1 emits |\u03a6\u207a\u3009\u208dA,B\u2080\u208e  \n  \u2022 Pair source 2 emits |\u03a6\u207a\u3009\u208dC\u2080,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 Single-photon emitter produces ancilla photon E\n\n2. Scattering & Wavefront Shaping:\n  \u2022 Photon B\u2080 \u2192 U\u2081 \u2192 programmable multiport W\u2081  \n  \u2022 Photon B\u2080 (via a fixed 50:50 BS in the same network) \u2192 U\u2082 \u2192 programmable multiport W\u2082  \n  \u2022 (We split B\u2080 into two spatial sub-modes across U\u2081, U\u2082\u2014BS is static.)  \n  \u2022 Similarly, photon C\u2080 is split and routed through the two channels U\u2081, U\u2082 and shaped by the same W\u2081, W\u2082 network.\n\n3. Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three distinct, Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to fuse plane polarization and wavefront shaping into a genuinely new network measurement or transformation\u2014none reducible to \u201cinvert unknown U + standard Bell measurement.\u201d  \n  a) Ancilla-mediated \u201csuper\u201d Bell analyzer through disorder (ancilla + wavefront shaping).  \n  b) Polarization-controlled entanglement-swap router (coherent link selection via wavefront shapers).  \n  c) Multi-path entanglement percolation via nonclassical parity filtering\u2014use two parallel disordered channels, partial wavefront shaping, and an ancilla-driven parity check to herald A\u2013D entanglement in one shot.  \nStep 2: Quick evaluation:  \n  a) echoes known ancilla-Bell tricks.  \n  b) reduces to controlled-SWAP primitives.  \n  c) stands out: it exploits two irreversibly scattering links in parallel, uses only limited mode control (no full inversion), and a new parity-filter measurement that cannot be factorized into inversion + Bell analysis. Pytheus can encode two fixed U\u2019s, two programmable multiports, an ancilla emitter, pair sources, and a linear-optical network for parity detection.  \nStep 3: Select (c).  \nStep 4: Novelty: This protocol harnesses multi-path redundancy through disordered channels plus a nonclassical parity filter to percolate entanglement\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment or standard optics scheme uses an ancilla-driven parity measurement across two unknown channels as a resource to create A\u2013D entanglement.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus natively supports fixed unitaries (the two scatterers U\u2081,U\u2082), programmable wavefront shapers W\u2081,W\u2082, one ancilla single-photon source, two entangled\u2010pair sources, static beam splitters/PBS/phase shifters, and number\u2010resolving detectors. No feedback, cavities, or nonlinear crystals are required\u2014only linear optics.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nI propose the following Pytheus target:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\u201d  \nWe want to herald entanglement between remote photons A and D by percolating two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D through two parallel unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081 and U\u2082. Instead of inverting each channel separately, we exploit partial wavefront shaping plus a novel ancilla-driven parity measurement across both channels to probabilistically cancel scattering noise and project B\u2080,C\u2080 onto an even-parity subspace. The detection of that even parity event heralds a high-fidelity Bell link between A and D\u2014effectively routing entanglement through whichever combination of the two channels succeeds\u2014without ever performing a full channel inversion or conventional Bell measurement.\n\nExperiment Layout:\n\n1.

Ancilla-Driven Parity Filter:\n  \u2022 The four outputs (two from B\u2080\u2019s paths, two from C\u2080\u2019s) plus ancilla E all enter one optimized linear\u2010optical network M (PBSs, 50:50 BSs, phase shifters).  \n  \u2022 M is designed so that only those four-click patterns corresponding to even total photon-number parity across B\u2080 and C\u2080 modes (mediated by ancilla interference) herald a successful projection onto the subspace \u2223HH\u27e9+\u2223VV\u27e9 (even parity) of B\u2080,C\u2080.  \n  \u2022 This parity measurement inherently fuses contributions from both channels without requiring them to be individually identified or inverted.\n\n4. Heralding & Entanglement Percolation:\n  \u2022 A specific click signature in M (plus detection of E) signals the even-parity outcome.  \n  \u2022 Conditioned on this herald, photons A and D collapse into an entangled Bell state, percolated through whichever combination of U\u2081/U\u2082 survived the parity filter.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering\",\n  fixed_unitaries: [\"U1\",\"U2\"],               // two unknown scattering channels  \n  programmable_unitaries: [\"W1\",\"W2\"],        // partial wavefront shapers for the two channels  \n  elements_to_optimize: [\"PBS\",\"BS\",\"phase-shifters\"], // network M implementing parity filter  \n  sources: [\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"A\",\"B0\"]},\n    {type:\"pair\", emits:[\"C0\",\"D\"]},\n    {type:\"single\", emits:[\"E\"]}\n  ],\n  detectors: [\"A_ready\",\"D_ready\",\"modes_B0\",\"modes_C0\",\"mode_E\"],\n  loss_func: \"1 - AvgPercolationSuccessProb\",\n  num_anc: 0,\n  removed_connections: []\n}\n\nWhy It\u2019s Novel:\n \u2013 Uses irreversible multi-path scattering as a resource rather than a nuisance\u2014no full inversion of U\u2081/U\u2082 is ever performed.  \n \u2013 Introduces a nonclassical parity filter across two disordered channels, mediated by a single ancilla photon, to herald entanglement percolation.  \n \u2013 Cannot be decomposed into \u201cinvert each channel + Bell swap\u201d; the measurement is a genuinely new network primitive.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Feasible:\n \u2013 Pytheus can optimize static unitaries (fixed scatterers), programmable blocks (wavefront shapers), ancilla & pair sources, linear optics (BS, PBS, phases), and number-resolving detectors.  \n \u2013 No dynamic feedback or forbidden nonlinear elements are needed.\n\nGeneralization:\n \u2013 Extend to N-path percolation across many scatterers, multi-node entanglement routing in disordered networks, or high-dimensional parity filtering for GHZ-state percolation.  \n \u2013 Basis for building robust quantum repeater networks in complex environments (biological tissue, multi-mode fiber) using parity\u2010filter primitives.\n\nThis proposal meets all constraints: it focuses on a quantum network transformation (percolation via parity measurement), uses plane polarization + wavefront shaping, stays within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics capabilities, and introduces a fundamentally new resource\u2014the ancilla-mediated multi-path parity filter\u2014that cannot be reduced to pre-compensation plus standard measurements.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: We translate the percolation\u2010via\u2010parity idea into a static LO state\u2010generation task: herald a Bell state between photons A and D by detecting B\u2080, C\u2080, and E.
