Final Answer###Title: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non‐Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear‐Optic Networks

Abstract: We realize two successive amplitude‐damping beam‐splitter couplings between system mode S₂ and entangled ancilla modes E₂ₐ, E₂ᵦ, followed by a heralded Bell‐state measurement on S₂, S₃ to swap entanglement onto S₁, S₄. By running parallel four‐mode Bell analyzers on (S₁,S₄) and (S₁,E₂ᵦ), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back‐flow in the post‐selected pure four‐mode state on S₁, S₄, E₂ₐ, E₂ᵦ for each (p₁,p₂), thus operationally certifying non‐Markovian memory.
