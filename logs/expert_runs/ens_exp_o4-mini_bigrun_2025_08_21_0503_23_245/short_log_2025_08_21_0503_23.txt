Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the proposed 4-site OTOC interferometer protocol with four atom-qubit inputs, four SPDC ancillas, a single static interferometer, and heralded ancilla detection. I'll run this through Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because the target kets are 8-mode patterns but only 4 in_nodes were declared. In a measurement scheme the total modes = in_nodes + ancilla injections = num_anc. We want 4 atoms + 4 ancilla photons = 8 modes. So set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], num_anc=8, out_nodes empty, target_quantum kets of length 8.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target “OTOC measurement” is not a straightforward state transform or measurement that Pytheus can encode: our 8-mode patterns include both atom inputs and ancilla detectors, but Pytheus expects the ‘target_quantum’ kets to match only the declared in/out nodes. In other words, we can’t express the out-of-time OTOC‐swap tests as a single static Fock or DV target in Pytheus’s current abstract‐state API. This experiment falls outside the framework Pytheus supports, so we cannot generate a valid config.  
Final Answer: Unfortunately, Pytheus cannot directly implement the proposed single-shot OTOC interferometer protocol because it cannot encode the required out-of-time ordered swap–test correlations as a single target state or measurement pattern within its current DSL.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target patterns span 8 modes, so we must declare all 8 photons as inputs; we'll set num_anc=0 and in_nodes=[0–7] to match the 8-length kets.

Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The OTOC interferometer is a measurement scheme: we have four “atom” inputs and four ancilla photons, and we detect all eight photons (4 atoms + 4 ancillas). The target patterns only refer to the four atom detectors (in_nodes) while all eight detectors click (num_anc = 8). So we set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], num_anc=8, out_nodes=[], heralding_out=false, and target_quantum with four-length strings. We choose the four patterns of atom‐detector clicks that signal the zero‐swap outcome: "0000","0011","1100","1111".
