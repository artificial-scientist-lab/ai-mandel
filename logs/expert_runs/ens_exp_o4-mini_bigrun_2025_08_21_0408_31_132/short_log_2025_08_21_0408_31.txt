SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration matches the researcher’s PT-enhanced teleportation‐CNOT: we have two SPDC ancillas (num_anc=2), forbid direct sources between A↔C and B↔B_target via removed_connections, set in/out nodes to [0,3] for A and C, use a CNOT truth‐table for target_quantum, and request heralded detection of all non‐out nodes. This remains 100% faithful to the idea.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. To fix this, we designate the two input qubits at nodes [0,1] and the two output qubits at [2,3], ensuring disjoint sets. We keep the PT‐filter ancilla photons, removed_connections to forbid undesired SPDC links, and the CNOT truth‐table as target_quantum.
