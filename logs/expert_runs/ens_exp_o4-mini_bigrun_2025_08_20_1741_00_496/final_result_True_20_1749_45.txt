}###Title: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling

Mini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R₁…R₅. By sweeping each Rᵢ from ½ (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.
