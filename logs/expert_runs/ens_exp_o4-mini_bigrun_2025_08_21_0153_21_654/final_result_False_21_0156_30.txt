Abstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1–2) and BC (modes 3–4), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a “squeezed-reservoir” Bell pair (modes 5–6) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob’s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice’s and Charlie’s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩—effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob’s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.
