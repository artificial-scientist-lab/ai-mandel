SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial suggestion had incorrect mode counts and target_quantum encoding. I need to represent the two input qubits in dual-rail (4 modes) and the single output ququart in quad-rail (4 modes), so my target_quantum strings must be length 8 with one-hot occupancy for each photon. I’ll set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], out_nodes=[4,5,6,7], use 4 ancilla photons, herald the ancilla only (heralding_out=true), and number_resolving detectors.
