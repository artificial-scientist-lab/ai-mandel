Mini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb’s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  
∑_{i,j∈{0,1}} |i,j⟩_in |2i+j⟩_out  
realizes the isometry mapping |00⟩→|0⟩, |01⟩→|1⟩, |10⟩→|2⟩ and |11⟩→|3⟩ without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.
