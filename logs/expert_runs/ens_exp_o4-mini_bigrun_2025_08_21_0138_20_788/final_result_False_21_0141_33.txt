}###Title: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping

Mini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol—targeting “Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping”—in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.
