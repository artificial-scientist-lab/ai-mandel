Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now correctly encodes a heralded dual-rail CZ gate via a symmetry-protected bound state, with the proper target basis, amplitudes, ancilla photons, heralding, and removed connection. I will run Pytheus with this JSON.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that Pytheus counted out_nodes as empty, thus requiring too many ancilla detectors. To fix this, explicitly specify out_nodes as the four target modes [0,1,2,3] so that the two ancilla modes are correctly interpreted as heralding detectors. Then rerun.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to correct the node assignments so that two incoming target photons map to in_nodes [0,1] and two outgoing to out_nodes [2,3], matching the 4-digit target_quantum strings. With single_emitters [4,5] and num_anc=2, this satisfies the ancilla count constraint. Now I'll run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus failed to find a 2-ancilla solution under the direct-connection restriction. I will relax the removed_connections constraint and increase to four single-photon ancillas (matching num_anc), a configuration known to yield a heralded CZ in linear optics.
