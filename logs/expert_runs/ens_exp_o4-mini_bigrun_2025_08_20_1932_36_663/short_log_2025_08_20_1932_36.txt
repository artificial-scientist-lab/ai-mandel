Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The idea is to use a chain of three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two intermediate Bell‐state measurements to generate end‐to‐end entanglement between modes A and Z, emulating the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. We ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence (entanglement) between the two output modes conditioned on all ancilla clicks. We forbid any direct source connecting A and Z.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'dim'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates Pytheus expected a "dimensions" key when using the 'ent' loss function on discrete-variable states. I'll add "dimensions":[2,2] and leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty as in the example ES_246. This should satisfy the requirement and avoid the KeyError.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises from attempting to use the untested 'ent' loss. To generate end‐to‐end entanglement, I will target the two‐mode Bell state using fidelity loss ('fid'), forbid direct SPDC between those two modes, and request four ancilla detectors (two per intermediate BSM), letting Pytheus choose the needed sources.
