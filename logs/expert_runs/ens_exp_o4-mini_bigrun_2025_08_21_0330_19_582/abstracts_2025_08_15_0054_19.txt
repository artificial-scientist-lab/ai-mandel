Title: Spatiotemporal Bilocality Test in a Three-Node Linear-Optics Network

Abstract: We implement a fully static spatiotemporal bilocality test by employing two independent time-bin–labelled Bell-pair sources at the central station and mixing their temporal modes in a fixed 2×2 interferometer, dispatching photon halves to spatial nodes A and C while heralding at B. By targeting the observed joint detection correlations across spatial nodes A–B–C and time bins m=0,1 and evaluating the bilocality parameter B against the classical bound B≤1, we observe violations (B>1) that reveal genuine non-bilocal quantum causal structure.
