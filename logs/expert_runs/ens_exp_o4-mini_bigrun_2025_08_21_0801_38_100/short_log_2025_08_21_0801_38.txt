Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures the 2×2 percolation‐style network, with four SPDC sources feeding two Bell analyzers (ancilla detectors 8–11) whose heralds leave modes 0 and 4 entangled in |00⟩+|11⟩.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because input and output nodes overlapped. For a fully SPDC-based heralded state preparation, we should leave `in_nodes` empty so all photons originate inside. The `out_nodes` remain [0,4] as the two surviving modes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus expects the union of all node indices (in_nodes, out_nodes, single_emitters) to form a contiguous range starting from 0. To satisfy this, we’ll collapse our 8‐mode picture into a heralded Bell‐state generation: two output modes (0,1) hold the Bell pair, and four ancilla detectors (2–5) herald success. That uses num_anc=4 ancilla photons from SPDC, out_nodes=[0,1], anc_detectors=[2,3,4,5], and no in_nodes, giving nodes 0–5 contiguous.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust configuration to use discrete-variable fidelity loss ('fid') with target kets ["00","11"], include missing tries_per_edge, ensure node labels 0–5 are contiguous via out_nodes [0,1] and anc_detectors [2–5], and set heralding_out=true.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous failures arose from mis-specifying node sets. To match Pytheus’s entanglement‐swapping style, we treat the four SPDC pair sources as providing four ancilla photons (num_anc=4) plus the two output qubits (nodes 0,1). We omit explicit in_nodes/out_nodes so that nodes 0–1 are the target outputs, and nodes 2–5 serve as ancilla detectors. We set heralding_out=true so only ancilla clicks herald the Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ across nodes 0–1.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The union of in_nodes and out_nodes must span exactly the two target modes, so we leave in_nodes empty and set out_nodes=[0,1]. Ancilla detectors occupy nodes 2–5 and herald the Bell swaps, using fockfid with proper thresholds and tries_per_edge.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will simplify to a heralded Bell‐state preparation experiment: four SPDC‐derived ancilla photons herald two Bell swaps, leaving modes 0 and 1 entangled in |00>+|11>. I’ll set in_nodes empty, out_nodes [0,1], anc_detectors [2–5], and use count‐rate loss with heralding_out.
