Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The provided configuration closely follows the researcher’s second suggestion but needs minor fixes: include `bulk_thr`, default `imaginary` and `unicolor`, set `seed` to null, and remove the redundant `amplitudes` (defaults to 1). Ensure `in_nodes` and `out_nodes` reflect the two SPDC inputs and the heralded outputs on modes 0 and 3.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket.

(truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity issue arises because with three ancilla detectors plus two output modes, the total photon number is odd and no perfect matching exists. Reducing to two ancillas yields an even total and satisfies the contiguity constraint by using output modes 0 and 1.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Define a purely Fock‐basis, post‐selected Bell heralding on modes 0 and 3 with two SPDC pair sources (implicit via num_pre=2), two ancilla detectors (num_anc=2) on modes 1&2 by setting heralding_out=true. Use fockcr to optimize the joint probability (“cr”) for the fock‐kets [1,0,0,1] and [0,1,1,0], ensuring perfect matchings exist (even total photons). No removed_connections needed since we do want sources on (0,1) and (2,3).

Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will simplify to an entanglement‐swapping network: two SPDC sources (num_pre=2) create pairs on (0,1) and (2,3); a Bell measurement on modes 1&2 via two ancilla detectors (num_anc=2) heralds a Bell state on modes 0&3. I set in_nodes=[1,2], out_nodes=[0,3], target_quantum for the Bell components, use count‐rate loss (‘cr’), and number‐resolving detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target is a heralded entanglement‐swapping network (two Bell‐pair sources on (0,1) and (2,3), joint environment measurement on modes 1&2 via ancilla detectors) that projects modes 0 and 3 onto the Bell state (|00⟩+|11⟩)/√2. We encode this as a post‐selected discrete‐variable transformation: in_nodes [1,2] are the measured environment modes, out_nodes [0,3] are the heralded outputs, and target_quantum lists the two Bell components “1001” and “0110” of the 4‐mode mapping |1_in1 1_in2⟩→|0_out0 3_out1⟩ etc. Use 2 SPDC pre‐sources (num_pre=2), 2 ancilla detectors (num_anc=2), heralding_out=true, count‐rate optimization (“cr”), number‐resolving, and remove no additional connections.
