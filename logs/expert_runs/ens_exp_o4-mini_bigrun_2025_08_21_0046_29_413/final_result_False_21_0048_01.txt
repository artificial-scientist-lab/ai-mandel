}###Title: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement

Mini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x⊕y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment—requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward—demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.
