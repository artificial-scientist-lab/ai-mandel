Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to convert the researcher's nonlocal parity–gate proposal into a valid Pytheus JSON config, fixing mapping bugs in the target strings while preserving the intended x⊕y behavior and matching Pytheus’s input/output conventions.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I mistakenly labeled Alice and Bob’s input photons as single_emitters, which conflicts with in_nodes. They should instead be true inputs (in_nodes), and no single_emitters are needed since ancillas come from SPDC. I’ll remove single_emitters and retry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections constraint cannot apply to input nodes in Pytheus, so I will drop it to satisfy the API while preserving the core parity-target.
