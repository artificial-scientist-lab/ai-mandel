Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration specifies a post‐selected four‐photon joint measurement (quantum butterfly Bell analyzer) on in_nodes [0–3], heralding the cross‐teleportation with four‐click patterns. It uses no sources (measurement only), num_anc=4 detectors, and target_quantum listing the four detection signatures. This aligns with Pytheus’s measurement design examples.
