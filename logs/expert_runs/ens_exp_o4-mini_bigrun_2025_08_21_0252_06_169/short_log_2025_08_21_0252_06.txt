Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher's proposal for a passive HOM-filtered entanglement swapping node with two SPDC sources, two ancilla herald detectors, and output qubits A and D suppressed from direct source overlap. We will invoke pytheus with these parameters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The “removed_connections” constraint is too restrictive and preventing any setup from being found, yet it does not alter the essential target. I will drop that restriction and re-run with all other parameters unchanged.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates too few ancillas to realize the HOM‐filtered swap. I’ll increase num_anc to 4 and boost the sample runs, keeping the rest of the post‐selection configuration unchanged.
