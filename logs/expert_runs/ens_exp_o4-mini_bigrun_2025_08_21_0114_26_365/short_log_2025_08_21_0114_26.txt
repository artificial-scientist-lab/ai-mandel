Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s high-level description must be translated into a valid Pytheus JSON config. I need to replace the non‐Pytheus keys (sources, beam_splitters, phase_shifters, post_selection, parameters_to_optimize) with the standard Pytheus keys and fill in all required fields. I will assume that we encode the single unknown qubit in modes 0–1, the SPDC ancilla pair in modes 2–3 and 4–5, herald on two detectors at modes 6–7, and leave the two clones on modes 8–9 and 10–11. I’ll write a schematic target mapping only the basis states |0⟩→|00⟩ and |1⟩→|11⟩ for the two clones, to capture the essence of cloning, and let Pytheus then optimize R₁,R₂,φ.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error arose because the single-photon emitter (unknown qubit) was listed both in in_nodes and single_emitters. In Pytheus, SPDC ancilla are specified via num_anc, and single_emitters is only for true single-photon sources beyond the unknown qubit. Here the unknown qubit is an input mode, not a “single_emitter” resource. I will remove single_emitters, pick a simple Fock‐fiducial target for the two clones (one pure target fock state [0,1,1]), set in_nodes to [0], out_nodes to [1,2], num_anc=2 for the SPDC pair, and heralding_out=true so that the two ancilla detectors click to herald. This config stays true to the researcher’s idea, mapping a single-photon qubit into two clone modes conditioned on two ancilla detections, and optimizes the beam splitters and phase via Pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The amplitude list was incorrectly specified; for a single Fock ket, amplitudes should be omitted so the default of 1 applies. I’ll remove the empty amplitudes key and rely on defaults, keeping the single input mode (0), two ancilla photons (num_anc=2), heralding detectors consume the ancilla (heralding_out=true), and the two clone outputs on modes [1,2] with target Fock pattern [0,1,1].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I realized that cloning an arbitrary qubit requires mapping |0>→|00> and |1>→|11>, which in Pytheus discrete-variable form is two kets of length 3 (input + two outputs). I'll switch to loss_func 'fid', set target_quantum=["000","111"] with amplitudes [1.0,1.0], use one input mode, two output modes, two ancilla photons, heralding on ancilla clicks, and tune R₁,R₂,φ via internal optimization. This config matches the researcher's description without altering the target.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous DV‐based target failed. I will switch to a simple Fock‐basis target: two photons, one in each clone mode (modes 0 and 1), heralded by detecting the two ancilla photons. This matches the researcher’s 1→2 heralded cloning in essence. I’ll use num_anc=2, fockfid loss, target_quantum=[[1,1,0,0]], out_nodes=[0,1], heralding_out=true, and default in_nodes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I must encode the 1→2 heralded cloning map by specifying basis mappings |0>→|00> and |1>→|11> across input and clone modes, use two SPDC ancilla photons with heralding, and let Pytheus tune the beam splitters and phase. I’ll define in_nodes for the input qubit (modes 0,1), out_nodes for the two clones (modes 2,3 for clone1, 4,5 for clone2), num_anc=2, heralding_out=true, and use loss_func 'fid' with target_quantum ["101010","010101"].
