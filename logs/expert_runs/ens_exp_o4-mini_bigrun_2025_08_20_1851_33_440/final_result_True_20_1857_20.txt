}###Title: Heralded Linear-Optical 1→2 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  

Mini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |ψ⟩ at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w₁,r_w₂,r_r₁,r_r₂} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus’s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.
