Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need a Pytheus configuration that faithfully encodes a three‐way “quantum‐metric classifier” for a photonic qutrit: one unknown qutrit input (3 modes), three reference SWAP‐test/entanglement‐swapping blocks (each requiring two ancilla photons), and routing into one of three output ports based on minimum Fubini–Study distance. We set num_anc=6, declare in_nodes and out_nodes, list the direct mapping of basis inputs to output ports, and forbid any direct connection from input modes to output modes via removed_connections to enforce the nonlocal SWAP‐test network. The loss function is count‐rate so that each run yields exactly one click at the correct port.
