Title: Mode‐Division‐Multiplexed On‐Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs

Abstract: We propose an integrated‐optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon‐pair sources into the target high‐fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩+|22⟩ by routing Alice’s spatial modes and Bob’s mode‐division‐multiplexed channels through a 6×6 linear‐optic parity‐check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on‐chip, mode‐division‐multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi‐stage high‐dimensional quantum networks.
