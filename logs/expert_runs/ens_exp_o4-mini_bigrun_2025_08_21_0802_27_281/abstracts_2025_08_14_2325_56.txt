Title: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain

Abstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A–B–C–D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 “edge-mode” Floquet steady cycle—flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period—purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.
