Title: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders

Abstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the “entanglement-switch quantum switch,” in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B→C→D vs. C→B→D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |Φ⁺⟩ between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.
