SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion describes a purely passive, one-shot measurement network using four ancilla photons entangled to data qubits and a 4×4 interferometer whose only heralding click patterns {D0&D2} and {D1&D3} correspond to the ±1 outcomes of Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄. To implement this in Pytheus I must specify a measurement configuration: use four single-photon emitters as sources, list the four ancilla detector modes as heralded outputs, leave the data modes unmeasured (out_nodes), and set the target_quantum to the two click patterns “1010” and “0101.” I’ll use a discrete‐variable “cr” loss and number‐resolving detectors, with no removed connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement network should treat the four ancilla photons as the only inputs to Pytheus, with four detectors capturing click patterns “1010” or “0101.” Data modes are not part of the Pytheus network. Remove single_emitters and anc_detectors, list in_nodes for the four ancilla, set num_anc = 4 and target_quantum accordingly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need a pure measurement network: four input ancilla photons, four detectors, two desired click patterns “1010” (even) and “0101” (odd). I’ll drop single_emitters and out_nodes, set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], num_anc=4, target_quantum=["1010","0101"], and add standard thresholds for loss_func “cr.”
