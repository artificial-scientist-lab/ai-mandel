Title: Heralded Linear‐Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits

Abstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  
U(θ)=cos θ I + i sin θ SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the θ-dependent population exchange |10⟩↔|01⟩ (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at θ→π/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular “quantum bus” for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.
