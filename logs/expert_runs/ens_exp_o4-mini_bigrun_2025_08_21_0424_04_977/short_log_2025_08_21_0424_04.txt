Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to encode a post-selected linear-optical partial-SWAP for a chosen angle (θ=π/4) as a discrete mapping in Pytheus, using ancillas and heralding. We'll map |00⟩→|00⟩, |11⟩→|11⟩ with amplitude 1, and |01⟩↔|10⟩ with amplitudes cos(π/4)=0.7071 and i·sin(π/4)=i·0.7071. We choose 2 ancilla photons from SPDC, number-resolving heralding, optimize fidelity.
