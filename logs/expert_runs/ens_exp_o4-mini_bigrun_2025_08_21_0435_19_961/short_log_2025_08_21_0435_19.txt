Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The post‐selected Bell‐state projection module with loop repetition simulates the N‐layer Floquet walk and performs entanglement swapping on the two input modes, projecting onto |Φ+>=|00>+|11>. We include two ancilla photons, set loops=4 for four discrete walk layers, and use a count‐rate loss to optimize the correlation projection.
