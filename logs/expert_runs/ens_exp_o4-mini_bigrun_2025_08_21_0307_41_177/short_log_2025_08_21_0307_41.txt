Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The SSH‐corner teleportation experiment is encoded as an entanglement‐swapping Bell‐pair generation between corners 0 and 3, with two interior measurements heralded via SPDC ancilla, enforcing the SSH adjacency via removed_connections. I will submit the final Pytheus configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to ensure the node indexing is consistent. For a two-photon Bell state across four modes (corners 0 and 3), I represent |1001>+|0110> on modes [0–3]. With no explicit in_nodes/out_nodes, Pytheus uses all four modes as outputs, giving a contiguous set {0,1,2,3}. I’ll set num_anc=2 SPDC sources, heralding interior Bell measurements, and forbid the non‐SSH “diagonals” via removed_connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Bell‐pair creation between corner modes 0 and 3 via two interior Bell measurements likely requires more ancilla photons to realize the projections. I'll increase num_anc from 2 to 4 and resubmit the configuration.
