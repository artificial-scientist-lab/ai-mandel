Mini-abstract: We design a static linear-optics network of N “collision” modules—each using a probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla, beam-splitter partial swaps and Bell measurements—to implement the Kraus operators K₀=I−(γΔt/2)J₊J₋ and K₁=√(γΔt)J₋ (with J₋=σ₋^(1)+σ₋^(2)), thereby simulating the master equation ∂ₜρ=γ D[J₋] ρ for two-qubit collective amplitude damping. The experiment’s target is the Choi vector of the N-step collective amplitude-damping channel, directly represented in PyTHEUS’s abstract state language across system inputs, outputs and ancilla outcomes.
