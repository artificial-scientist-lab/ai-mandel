Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target is the Choi state of a single step (N=1) collective two‐qubit amplitude‐damping channel. We encode qubits in two spatial modes each, so we have 4 “system” modes: 0–1 for input, 2–3 for output, plus 4 ancilla detectors (from two Bell‐measurements), total modes 0–7. We forbid any direct source connecting input modes (0,1) to output modes (2,3) via “removed_connections”. We use 4 ancilla photons from SPDC (“num_anc”:4), no single‐emitters. We set “target_quantum” to the (unnormalized) Choi vector entries of the map K0,K1 acting on a maximally entangled state: 
|Choi⟩ = (K0⊗I)|Φ+⟩ + (K1⊗I)|Φ+⟩ 
with γΔt=0.1→√(0.1)=0.3162, (1–0.1)=0.9→√(0.9)=0.9487.
Expanding gives the list of 8‐bit strings and amplitudes below.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the configuration to generate the Choi vector as a state‐generation task (no in/out nodes), using target_quantum strings of length 4 (system modes) and appropriate amplitudes for K₀⊗I + K₁⊗I.
