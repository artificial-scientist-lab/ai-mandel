Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the researcher’s discrete‐variable encoding of the logical Hadamard via sequential Bell measurements. All parameters reflect the suggested target |0〉→|+〉, |1〉→|–〉 with amplitudes [1,1,1,–1] and 8 ancilla photons for the four Bell modules around the loop. I will run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arises because the data qubit node is both an input and a single-photon emitter. In our SPDC‐only ancilla scheme, the data qubit can enter externally, so we should remove the single_emitters field.
