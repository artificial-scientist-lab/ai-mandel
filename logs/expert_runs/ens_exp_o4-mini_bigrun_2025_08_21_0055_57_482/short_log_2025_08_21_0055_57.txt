Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to provide Pytheus with the exact configuration suggested, ensuring all keys are syntactically correct JSON and match the researcher's description of the closed‐loop teleportation protocol on a four‐site SSH ring.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'target_state'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because we forgot to specify a `target_quantum`.  In this measurement‐based protocol the success condition is that all six detectors click (four Bell‐swap ancilla detectors plus the two outputs of the final interferometer).  We therefore set  
  target_quantum = ["111111"]  
to demand one photon on each of those six output modes.  All other config fields remain faithful to the SSH‐ring teleportation suggestion.
