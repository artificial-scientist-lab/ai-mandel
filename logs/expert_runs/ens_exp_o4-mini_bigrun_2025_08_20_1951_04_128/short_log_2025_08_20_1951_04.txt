Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed configuration captures the core 1→2 symmetric qutrit telecloning transformation with a three‐mode Bell measurement, three SPDC ancillas, and heralding via resonance‐dip signature. I will submit this to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial configuration failed due to insufficient ancillas. I will increase ancilla photons to 4, update the detectors accordingly, and give Pytheus more optimization samples.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The core telecloning transformation maps |0⟩→|00⟩, |1⟩→|11⟩, |2⟩→|22⟩ with three ancilla photons for the 3-mode Bell measurement, heralded by their detectors. I’ll request Pytheus to optimize this static heralded gate using num_anc=3, in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1,2], target_quantum=["000","111","222"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Refine to a basis‐mapping telecloner: use in_nodes [0,1] (input+blank qutrit), out_nodes [2,3] (two clones), ancilla photons for herald. Map |0,0>→|0,0>, |1,0>→|1,1>, |2,0>→|2,2>. Use two ancillas.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The telecloner is a heralded basis‐mapping gate on two input qutrits (unknown + blank) to two output clones, using 4 SPDC ancilla photons for a 3-mode Bell‐measurement heralded by ancilla‐only detection. Increase ancillas to 4 for an even total, boost samples and tries_per_edge.
