}###Title: Heralded Non-Markovian Amplitude-Damping Channel via Cascaded Environment Bell Measurement

Abstract: We implement a heralded non-Markovian amplitude-damping channel by cascading two beam-splitter amplitude-damping interactions with vacuum ancillas and performing a joint Bell-state measurement on the environment modes, thereby conditionally projecting the environment to induce memory effects and partially recover lost coherence. Using the Pytheus photonic simulator, we optimize the ancilla coupling efficiencies and analyzer phase to maximize the average fidelity of the targeted heralded non-Markovian amplitude-damping channel, establishing a new measurement-engineered quantum channel primitive.
