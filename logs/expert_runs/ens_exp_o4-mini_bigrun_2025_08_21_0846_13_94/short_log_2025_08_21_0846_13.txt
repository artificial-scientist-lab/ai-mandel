Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The protocol is recast as a heralded dual-rail identity gate: two single‐photon sources encode a qubit, two cascaded loss‐BS interactions share their environment modes, which are Bell‐analyzed (PNR detectors 4&5), and success heralds the identity mapping on modes 6&7. Pytheus will optimize the BS ratios and analyzer phase to maximize the count‐rate fidelity over the two computational basis states.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because input nodes and single_emitters overlapped. For our heralded dual‐rail identity mapping we don’t need extra single‐photon emitters; the environment modes are vacuum. We remove single_emitters, set num_anc=0, and keep in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[6,7], heralding_out on detectors [4,5].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The errors arose because node indices must be contiguous and single_emitters must be disjoint from in_nodes. We'll recast the protocol as a heralded dual‐rail identity gate: two input modes (0,1) to two output modes (2,3), no explicit single_emitters, and two ancilla photons (environment modes) monitored but not in the target mapping. We set num_anc=2, in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3], target_quantum for the identity mapping ["1010","0101"], and heralding_out=true to detect ancillas only.
