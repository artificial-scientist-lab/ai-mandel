Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration correctly encodes a heralded teleportation mapping from mode 0 into an equal superposition over modes 1,2,3, with three SPDC ancillas, removed direct connections, and heralding so the output photon remains available. I'll invoke Pytheus with this config.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The original discrete‐variable mapping with heralded teleportation into a coherent superposition isn’t directly supported as a DV gate in Pytheus. Instead, we can realize the core of the teleportation step—heralded generation of a single‐photon superposition across three spatial modes—via a Fock‐state preparation. We switch to a fidelity‐based Fock optimization ('fockfid'), define the target superposition state |ψ⟩=(|0100⟩+|0010⟩+|0001⟩)/√3 over four modes (modes 0–3), and use three SPDC ancillas with heralding. This implements the same network structure (three pair sources, herald detection) and yields the desired equal‐amplitude state across modes 1,2,3. Action: pytheus

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The direct heralded teleportation mapping was too complex for Pytheus. Instead, I’ll request a pure linear‐optical unitary that takes one photon in mode 0 and deterministically maps it into the equal superposition over modes 1,2,3. This is a standard DV fidelity problem with no ancillas. I specify the 1→3 mapping as three 8‐bit basis transitions with amplitudes 1/√3.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Reformulate as a DV fidelity‐based heralded gate using three single‐photon emitters as ancillas. Map |0⟩₀→|000⟩₁₂₃ and |1⟩₀→( |100⟩+|010⟩+|001⟩ )/√3. Use in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1,2,3], num_anc=3 single_emitters=[4,5,6], heralding_out=true, loss_func="fid".
