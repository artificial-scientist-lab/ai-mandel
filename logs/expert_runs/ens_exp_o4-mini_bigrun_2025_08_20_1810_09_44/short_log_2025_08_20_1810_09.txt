Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement network is now fully specified as a Pytheus config for a one‐shot 4-body Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ parity readout, so we run the tool.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node indices must form a contiguous set from 0. We treat the four ancilla inputs as in_nodes [0–3] and the four data outputs as out_nodes [4–7]. This makes the union {0..7} and matches the 4‐click target patterns.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement is a pure ancilla-photon detection with no outgoing data modes. I'll set in_nodes to [0,1,2,3], out_nodes empty, and match target_quantum length to 4.
