}###Title:  
One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette

Mini-abstract:  
We demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4×4 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the ±1 eigenstates of Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.
