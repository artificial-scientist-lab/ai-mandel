Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures a static 3×3 toroidal Bell-pair lattice with 18 probabilistic SPDC sources feeding 18 BSM modules (36 ancilla detectors), and post-selects on the Bell outcome between two opposite nodes as the target Bell state |00>+|11>. We'll optimize fidelity via 'fid' and use number-resolving detectors.
