Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the suggested modifications, encoding two Bell-pair inputs, four ancilla detectors for the no-jump/no-phase-flip heralds, forbidden SPDC connections, and a post-selected Bell swap onto modes 0 and 3. We now run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because out_nodes must be disjoint from in_nodes. We want A and D as the only outputs, so we clear in_nodes (treat both Bell pairs as sources generated by SPDC) and set out_nodes=[0,3].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because node indices must form a contiguous sequence from 0 to N. We’ll assign inputs to nodes [0,1,2,3], outputs to [4,7], and ancilla detectors to [8,9,10,11], covering nodes 0–11.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus needs a generation-style config with no explicit inputs/outputs and a total of num_anc environment photons equal to the four damping‐ancillas plus the two Bell-measurement detectors. We encode the target 2-qubit Bell state ["00","11"], forbid any source linking the two output modes with `removed_connections = [[0,1]]`, and let Pytheus optimize BS networks for amplitude and phase damping blocks plus the post-selected swap.
