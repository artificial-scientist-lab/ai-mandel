Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s proposal for a heralded, phase‐detuned asymmetric 1→2 qubit cloner via static linear optics in Pytheus, with one single-photon emitter input at node 0, an SPDC ancilla pair at nodes 1 and 2, two heralding detectors, and two clone output modes at nodes 3 and 4. We’ll run the optimization with count‐rate loss, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection on the ancilla clicks.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because we declared node 0 as both an input (in_nodes) and a single‐photon emitter. To fix this, we should list only the ancilla SPDC modes as in_nodes and reserve node 0 exclusively for the single-photon emitter (the unknown qubit).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous setup mis‐indexed the nodes and mis‐specified the mapping length. Following the gate examples, the SPDC ancilla and herald detectors are implicit. We only list the unknown input (node 0) in in_nodes, the two clone outputs at nodes 1,2 in out_nodes, use one SPDC pair (num_pre=1) and detect only the ancilla (heralding_out=true). The mapping strings are 3-digit: [input,clone1,clone2] → we require |0⟩→|00⟩ (“000”) and |1⟩→|11⟩ (“111”). We optimize fidelity with loss_func='fid'.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous errors stemmed from mis‐using single_emitters; the unknown photon should be an input, and SPDC ancilla implicitly handled by num_pre. We'll remove single_emitters and list only the input and output nodes, set num_pre=1 and num_anc=2 for the two heralding detectors, and specify the simple qubit mapping ["000","111"] with fidelity loss.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The core primitive is now encoded as a heralded 1→2 asymmetric qubit cloning transformation: single-photon emitter at node 0, SPDC ancilla at nodes 1,2, two herald detectors (num_anc=2) with heralding_out=true, and two clone outputs at nodes 3,4.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The attempted encoding of the phase-detuned asymmetric cloner cannot be mapped to Pytheus’s discrete transformation format—Pytheus cannot represent a tunable, non‐unitary, heralded cloning map with simple target kets.  
Final Answer: This primitive is outside Pytheus’s current scope for abstract linear‐optic gates and post‐selected transformations.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Remove the single_emitters entry and rely on SPDC‐ancilla (num_pre=1) implicit modes. List the unknown qubit at in_nodes=[0], the two clone outputs at out_nodes=[1,2], use num_anc=2 with heralding (heralding_out=true), optimize for fidelity with target_quantum=["000","111"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: After multiple attempts, Pytheus reports that no perfect‐matching (and hence no even‐photon routing) can realize the requested 1→2 heralded cloning map with three input photons (odd total). This lies outside the current Fock‐basis limitations of Pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed 1→2 cloning map increases photon number and cannot be directly realized as a discrete‐variable Fock transformation in Pytheus (which conserves total photons). Therefore this target lies outside Pytheus’s capability: no perfect matching exists for an odd total photon number to herald two‐fold clicks while producing two output clones.  
Final Answer: This heralded phase‐detuned asymmetric 1→2 qubit cloner cannot be implemented with Pytheus under its Fock‐basis, photon‐number–conserving framework.
