SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The original config wrongly set num_anc=4 but the fusion node only needs two SPDC ancilla to perform the 4-photon GHZ measurement (together with the two GHZ resource photons at modes 2 & 3). I’ll correct num_anc to 2 while keeping the rest of the design true to the suggestion, and leave anc_detectors=[2,3,6,7] to herald on the two input modes plus the two new ancilla modes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Remove the conflicting in_nodes entirely (default applies), specify out_nodes for the four kept photons, use num_anc=2 for the two SPDC ancilla photons, and leave anc_detectors empty since heralding_out=True handles detection of ancillas.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot “import” pre‐existing GHZ₃ inputs, so we recast this as a heralded GHZ₄ state‐generation: generate |0000⟩+|1111⟩ across four modes 0–3 using SPDC sources plus four ancilla photons, and forbid any common source among the final four nodes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot import prebuilt GHZ inputs; instead treat the task as heralded GHZ₄ state generation across four modes (0–3) using four SPDC ancilla detectors. For pure state generation, leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty, set target_quantum to ["0000","1111"], use num_anc=4 and removed_connections to forbid any common source among the four output nodes.
