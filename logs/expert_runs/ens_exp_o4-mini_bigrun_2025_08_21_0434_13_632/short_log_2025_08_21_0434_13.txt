Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s sketch listed qutrit patterns with ’2’s, but atomic emitters encode qubits, so we must restrict to binary matches (0 or 1) yielding eight patterns. Also this is a measurement device: photons are emitted by the six single_emitters, so we set in_nodes empty and num_anc=6 detectors, add single_emitters, specify target_quantum as the eight binary match patterns, and remove any extraneous fields.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust node assignments so that single_emitters and out_nodes are disjoint. Assign outputs to modes 0–5 and place the emitters on modes 6–11.
