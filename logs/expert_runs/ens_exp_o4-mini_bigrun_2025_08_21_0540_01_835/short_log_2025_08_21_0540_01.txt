Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now reflects a Pytheus‐compatible state preparation that teleports an arbitrary qubit from mode 0 into the even superposition over modes 1 and 2 (analogue of corners 1&3), with four ancilla photons, only SPDC sources, two‐hop paths enforced by removed_connections, heralded output, and fidelity optimization. Let's run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity error arises because the total photon number (input + ancilla + output) must be even to allow perfect matchings under 'fid'. To fix this, increase num_anc from 4 to 5 so total photons = 1 (input) + 5 (ancilla) + 2 (outputs) = 8, ensuring an even count. Remove restrictive connections to let Pytheus freely assign pair sources.
