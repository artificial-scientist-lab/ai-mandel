Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The static GHZ+ analyzer configuration is ready for Pytheus. It uses three incoming qubit photons at modes 0–2, two single-photon ancillas at modes 3–4, and targets the |000⟩+|111⟩ projection with post-selective five-click detection.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus expects as many detectors (num_anc) as total input‐plus‐single_emitter photons when no explicit out_nodes are used. We have 3 incoming + 2 ancillas = 5 photons, so set num_anc=5.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd total photon count caused perfect‐matching failure. Following GHZ analyzer examples, drop single_emitters and let num_anc=5 denote the five detectors (3 inputs + 2 SPDC ancillas), in_nodes=[0,1,2], out_nodes empty, target_quantum=["000","111"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd total-photon error indicates Pytheus can handle odd input counts without explicit ancillas, like GHZ_2d. I'll drop ancillas entirely and target the static 3-photon GHZ+ projector with num_anc=3 detectors and in_nodes=[0,1,2].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The root issue is that Pytheus needs an even total photon‐number graph for perfect matchings when using Fock‐based optimization. A pure DV‐basis (qubit rails) GHZ measurement should use the ‘fid’ loss for discrete variables. I will target the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector in DV with loss_func='fid', no ancillas, qubit rails as in_nodes, and number_resolving off.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Here is the final static‐GHZ⁺ analyzer configuration using three input qubits and three single‐photon ancillas (total 6 photons, enabling perfect matchings).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To avoid the odd‐photon perfect‐matching problem, I'll switch to discrete‐variable fidelity ('fid') and explicitly mark the three incoming qubits as both in_nodes and out_nodes, with no ancillas and number_resolving turned off. This follows the DV GHZ measurement strategy.
