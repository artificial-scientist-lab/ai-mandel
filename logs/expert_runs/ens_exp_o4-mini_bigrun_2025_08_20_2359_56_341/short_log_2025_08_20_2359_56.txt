Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Configuring a static linear‐optical network that swaps entanglement through two dissipative channels in opposite orders. We set two SPDC sources on modes (0,2) and (1,3) with removed connections [[0,3],[1,2]] to enforce nonlocality, four ancilla detectors for no‐jump/no‐phase‐flip heralds, and post‐select on the Φ⁺ outcome at detectors [12,13]. The target is the two‐qubit Bell state on output modes 0 and 3, fidelity maximized via a count‐rate loss.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Added the missing tries_per_edge, defined out_nodes to specify the two output modes 0 and 3, and set heralding_out to true so only the ancilla and Bell-measurement clicks are used for post-selection.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node‐index error arises because out_nodes [0,3] left gaps in the contiguous node set. We restore contiguous 0–N coverage by treating the two final modes as nodes 2 and 3 and include all four input/output nodes {0,1,2,3}. Ancilla/Bell detectors (anc_detectors and heralding_out) lie outside that set and do not affect node‐contiguity checks.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because specifying in/out nodes mismatched the two-mode Bell-state target. Converting this to a state-preparation task (no in/out nodes) with two output modes resolves the node-count issue. I remove in_nodes and out_nodes and retain the SPDC ancillas via num_anc and removed_connections.
