}###Title: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping

Mini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L₁ (amplitude damping) and L₂ (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the Φ⁺ outcome and comparing A–D output fidelities under L₁∘L₂ versus L₂∘L₁, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L₁,L₂], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.
