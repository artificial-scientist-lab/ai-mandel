}###Title: Protected Non-Abelian D₃ Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle

Mini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |ψ⟩ from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D₃ group operation (120° rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D₃ unitary emerge intrinsically from the network’s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.
