}###Title: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice–Bob Bell Pair Generation

Abstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus’s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.
