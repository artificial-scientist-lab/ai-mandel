SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration mostly aligns with the intended passive, heralded splitting of a 16-dimensional Bell into two 4-dimensional Bell pairs, but we need two SPDC sources (num_pre=2) for the initial high-dim Bell and we can drop the explicit anc_detectors key. All other parameters faithfully capture the researcher’s target without simplifying the supermap.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure stems from specifying two SPDC sources for an incoming Bell link that is already provided. We should treat the 16D Bell pair as incoming and remove all probabilistic pair sources by setting num_pre to 0. Keeping the ancilla emitter and heralding restrictions intact, we'll rerun with num_pre=0.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The fixed config removes the over-restrictive removed_connections so Pytheus can find a solution, keeping the single ancilla emitter and heralding_out flag as required.
