Title: “Linear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits”

Abstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2×2 unitary mapping the ((Q₁Q₂)(Q₃Q₄)) fusion basis to (Q₁(Q₂Q₃)Q₄), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  

Abstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L×L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.
