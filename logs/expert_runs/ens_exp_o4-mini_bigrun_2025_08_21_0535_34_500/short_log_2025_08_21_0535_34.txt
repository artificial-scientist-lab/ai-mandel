SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion describes a measurement device (no out_nodes) that confirms acceptance of the input five‐mode state when certain ancilla detectors click. We treat this as a Pytheus measurement setup: in_nodes=[0,1,2,3,4], no out_nodes, num_anc=11 (total detectors), target_quantum listing the eight basis kets supporting |+⟩⊗Φ+⊗Φ+, and we enforce no direct SPDC between sources 1–3,1–4,2–3,2–4 via removed_connections. We include single_emitters for the control source. This config matches the researcher’s description exactly.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus requires single_emitters to be disjoint from in_nodes. To respect the researcher’s target (control qubit measured alongside the SPDC photons), we must remove the single_emitters field. The control qubit remains an incoming node and is detected like the others. All other parameters remain true to the proposal.
