Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Use the published GHZ‐analyzer example with minimal keys and increased samples to implement a genuine‐tripartite‐entanglement witness measurement network that Pytheus can execute.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot directly realize the proposed variational three‐tangle witness, but it can implement a static ancilla-assisted GHZ‐basis analyzer which functions as a genuine tripartite-entanglement witness.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot support the proposed variational three‐tangle witness directly. The closest supported genuine‐multipartite‐entanglement measurement is a static three-photon two-dimensional GHZ analyzer. I will return that working configuration as our entanglement‐witness device.
