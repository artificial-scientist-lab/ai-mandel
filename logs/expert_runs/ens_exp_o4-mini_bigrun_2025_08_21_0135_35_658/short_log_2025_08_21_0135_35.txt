Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The static measurement scheme for distinguishing GHZ₄ vs. two Bell pairs is captured by a four-photon ancilla heralding pattern on detectors 4–7. We forbid any direct probabilistic source between modes (0,3) and (1,2) and require all four ancilla clicks only for |0000⟩+|1111⟩. We'll run Pytheus with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections must reference detector nodes, but the analyzer can work as a pure measurement scheme on the four inputs. I'll drop nonlocal constraints and reserve removed_connections for future network‐level disambiguation. We'll configure a static four‐photon POVM that clicks exactly on GHZ₄ patterns '0000' and '1111' and remains silent otherwise, effectively distinguishing GHZ₄ vs. Bell⊗Bell.
