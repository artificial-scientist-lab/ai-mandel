Title: Photon-Number–Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD

Mini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.
