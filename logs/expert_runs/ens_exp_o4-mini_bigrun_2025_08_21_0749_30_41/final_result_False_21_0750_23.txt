}###Title:  “Heralded Nonlocal CNOT Gate Between Distant Time-Bin Qubits via Plasmonic-Slot Slow-Light Delay Lines”

Mini-abstract: We propose a fully static, linear-optical scheme for a heralded, nonlocal Controlled-NOT gate acting on two remote time-bin qubits—control at node A and target at node B—by using four plasmonic-slot waveguide slow-light delay lines to passively synchronize two input photons, two Bell-pair ancilla photons, and one herald photon into two discrete time slots. A central interferometric circuit at station M implements the joint measurement projecting onto the CNOT superoperator, with success heralded by specific click patterns, introducing the first on-chip, postselected primitive for distributed quantum logic.
