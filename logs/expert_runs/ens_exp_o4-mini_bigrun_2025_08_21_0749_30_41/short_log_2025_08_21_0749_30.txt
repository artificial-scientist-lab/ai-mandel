Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modification aligns with a heralded CNOT between two qubits using four ancillas from SPDC, with no direct A–B source enforced via removed_connections. I’ll add removed_connections:[[0,1]] to enforce nonlocality and submit the full JSON config to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections entry caused an error because it referenced input nodes; nonlocality for input qubits is already enforced by separate single-photon sources. I will remove removed_connections and retry.
