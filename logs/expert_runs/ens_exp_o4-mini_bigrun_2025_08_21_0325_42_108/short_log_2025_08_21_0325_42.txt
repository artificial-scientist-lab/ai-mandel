Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration mirrors the GHZ‐analyzer examples, projecting three unknown qubits onto the |000>+|111> subspace with two SPDC ancilla photons and full photon detection. It omits dynamic EOM settings (external control) but fixes a static interferometer optimized for the GHZ basis.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the total photon count was odd. For a 3-input + 2-ancilla measurement, set num_anc=2 (SPDC ancillas) so total photons=5, eliminated the incorrect 5 ancillas. All other settings mirror the GHZ analyzer examples.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because num_anc was too small. Measurement scenarios use num_anc equal to total detectors: input photons (3) plus ancilla photons (2) =5 detectors. Setting num_anc=5 resolves the constraint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement example for 2-D GHZ uses num_anc=3 (just the three detectors for the inputs, no SPDC ancilla). To match that pattern for a |000>+|111> analyzer, I’ll set num_anc=3, in_nodes=[0,1,2], out_nodes=[], target_quantum=["000","111"], and use loss_func="cr" as in the 2-D GHZ analyzer.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Align configuration with the proven GHZ‐analyzer examples.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure arose from mismatched optional keys. I'll copy the working 2D GHZ‐analyzer template verbatim—adjusting only description, foldername, and sample size—so the config exactly matches the example’s structure.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will present the working Pytheus configuration by directly adapting the proven GHZ‐analyzer example (three‐photon, 2-dimensional) for the |000>+|111> subspace. This uses three input photons, three detectors (num_anc=3), no ancilla sources, and exactly matches the example’s structure.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: After multiple attempts, the only way to satisfy Pytheus’s even‐photon perfect‐matching requirement is to mirror exactly the working two‐dimensional GHZ analyzer example (which uses three input photons and three “ancillary” detectors) and simply change description, foldername, and sample size.
