Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration mixed input qubit sources as “single_emitters” and had incomplete removed_connections. To align with Pytheus conventions, I will treat the two qubit inputs as incoming modes (0,1), use SPDC ancilla pairs (modes 2–5) with num_anc=4, map outputs to modes 2–3, and herald on the four ancilla detectors by setting heralding_out=true. I’ll include the Berry‐loop constraint via the four removed_connections exactly as proposed, and add the amplitudes for the CZ phase. This preserves the CZ target unaltered while fixing the resource specification.
