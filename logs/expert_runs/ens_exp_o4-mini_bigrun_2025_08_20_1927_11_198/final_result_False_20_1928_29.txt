Abstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate—i.e. |jk⟩→(−1)^{jk}|jk⟩—using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P₁→P₂→P₃ and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net π geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11⟩ component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.
