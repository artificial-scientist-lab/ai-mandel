}###Title:
Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network

Mini-Abstract:
We employ a C₃-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three‐fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number–resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.
