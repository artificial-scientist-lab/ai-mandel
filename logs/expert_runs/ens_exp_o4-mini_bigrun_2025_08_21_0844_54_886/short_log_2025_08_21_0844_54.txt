Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration implements two SPDC sources generating Bell pairs, routes each half through a minimal SSH chain (one internal loss node per chain), uses four ancilla detectors (two internal loss + two central Bell‐measurement detectors) with heralding_out=true so only ancilla clicks are registered, and post‐selects a purified Bell state |00>+|11> on the two output nodes (indices 2 and 5). Removed_connections forbids the alternate links [0,2] and [1,3] to realize the SSH topology in the topological phase.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node indices must be contiguous from 0 to 5, so I’ll make the two output modes nodes 0 and 1, the four ancilla modes nodes 2–5, and forbid alternate links [2,3] and [4,5] to model the SSH topology.
