Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects the proposed Superposed-Function Quantum Network, using dual-rail control (modes 0–1), two Bell-pair SPDC inputs (modes 2–3 and 4–5), six ancilla photons, removed_connections to enforce nonlocality, heralded detection of ancillas only, and the two target patterns ["101001","011100"] with equal amplitudes. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arose because the control source (single_emitter at mode 0) was also listed in in_nodes. Removing in_nodes entirely resolves this without altering the core target or implementation.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Explicitly set out_nodes to an empty list to avoid the conflict with single_emitters.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arises because single_emitters and out_nodes overlap. To resolve this without altering the target, I remove single_emitters and treat the control qubit as an incoming photon (in_nodes). I explicitly set out_nodes to empty so all non-ancilla modes remain outputs. This ensures disjointness and preserves the intended superposed-function network.
