Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to translate the researcher’s telecloning network into a valid Pytheus JSON config. I’ll encode the dual‐rail input on modes 0–1 and the two dual‐rail clones on modes 2–5, use two SPDC Bell‐pair sources (four ancilla photons total, num_anc=4), herald on memory modes 4 and 5 by setting heralding_out=true, optimize for discrete‐variable fidelity (‘fid’) with target mapping |0⟩→|00⟩ and |1⟩→|11⟩, and include realistic thresholds.
