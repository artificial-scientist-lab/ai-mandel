}###Title: Single‐Shot Optical Realization of a Three‐Kraus Exceptional‐Point Quantum Channel

Mini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(φ) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4×4 linear‐optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase φc, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional‐point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(φ) and analysis of its 2×2 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional‐point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.
