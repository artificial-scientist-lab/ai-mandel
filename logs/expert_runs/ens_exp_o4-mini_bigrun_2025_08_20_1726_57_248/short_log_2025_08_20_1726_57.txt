Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures a four-node entanglement-swapping chain with three Bell measurements (six ancilla photons), targeting a Bell state on end modes 0 & 1 and maximizing end-to-end entanglement under SPDC sources. We forbid any direct SPDC link between modes 0 and 1 to enforce non-local swapping. This is ready to submit to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'dim'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The KeyError likely arises due to missing dimension metadata for the 'ent' loss function. I’ll include a 'dimensions' field specifying two qubits and simplify the config to essential parameters.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The 'ent' loss function triggers a missing 'dim' error. I will switch to fidelity ('fid') targeting the two-mode Bell state, which also implies maximizing end-to-end entanglement via high fidelity. I’ll remove the ent loss and rerun the configuration.
