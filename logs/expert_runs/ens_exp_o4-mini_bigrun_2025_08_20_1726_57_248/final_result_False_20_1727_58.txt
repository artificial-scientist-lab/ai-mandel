}###Title: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network

Mini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.
