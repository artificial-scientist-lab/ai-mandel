Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested dihedral‐braiding teleportation router requires encoding each of the four non‐Abelian outcomes as superpositions of two detection patterns, so I’ll list all eight basis patterns in target_quantum, give their complex weights in polar form, and leave in_nodes empty (all photons enter the network) and out_nodes empty (all are detected). I’ll enable complex amplitudes with imaginary:"polar" and number‐resolving detection.
