Title: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock‐Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas

Mini‐Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  
  M|0⟩=|0⟩,  
  M|1⟩=g |1⟩  (g>1)  
on an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis { |0⟩,|1⟩ }. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal–idler pair together with two pure single-photon “photon-blockade” ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number–resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.
