Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The GHZ-basis analyzer is formulated as a three-photon projective measurement onto the two-dimensional GHZ subspace (|000〉+|111〉). We inject three unknown qubits (modes 0–2) and two ancilla photons (SPDC pair) into a static 50:50-BS mesh with embedded phase-shifters; we optimize the click–pattern correlations on five photon-number-resolving detectors (0–2,5,6) to herald the GHZ outcome.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0))].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to align the config with existing GHZ‐analyzer examples: use probabilistic pair sources (num_anc = total detectors = 5), in_nodes for the three inputs, out_nodes empty, target_quantum ["000","111"], default heralding (null), number_resolving true. This matches the pattern of GHZ_analyzer_3d, just for qubits.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed reconfigurable GHZ-basis analyzer requires mapping three qubits onto four distinct GHZ outcomes—i.e. a four‐outcome projective measurement—which goes beyond Pytheus’s current capabilities (it only designs state preparations or single‐outcome post‐selected measurements). No static linear‐optical configuration can be optimized in Pytheus to unambiguously discriminate all four GHZ basis states without feed-forward.  
Final Answer: This target cannot be implemented within Pytheus’s present framework.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement setup should mirror the GHZ_3d example but for qubit GHZ; use total detectors =5, three signal inputs, no single emitters, SPDC for ancilla, loss_func 'cr', target kets ["000","111"], in_nodes [0,1,2], out_nodes empty, and default heralding_out (None) to require all five clicks.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The matching error arises from an odd total photon number (3 inputs + an even number of SPDC ancilla), which prevents any perfect matching. To fix this, introduce a single-photon emitter to supply one ancilla photon, making the total photon count even (3 inputs + 1 single + 2 SPDC = 6). We set num_anc=6 (6 detectors), specify one single emitter at mode 3, and let one SPDC source produce the remaining two ancilla photons. This restores an even total and allows perfect matchings for the qubit GHZ kets.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity error arises from an odd total photon number (3 inputs + 2 SPDC ancilla = 5), which cannot form a perfect matching. To fix this, add one single‐photon ancilla (mode 3) so total photons = 3 inputs + 1 single + 2 SPDC = 6. This restores an even total and permits perfect matchings without altering the target GHZ measurement.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd total photon number was preventing any perfect matching. Introduce one single‐photon ancilla (mode 3) plus one SPDC pair (2 photons) for a total of 3 ancilla, so 3 inputs + 3 ancilla = 6 photons (even). This parity‐corrects the GHZ measurement setup.

Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity‐and‐detector‐count error arises because each in_node must exit via an ancilla detector when no out_nodes are specified. With 3 in_nodes, we need num_anc ≥ 3. We choose num_anc = 4 (as in the GHZ_3d example we can drop single emitters and use SPDC ancilla). This mirrors the working GHZ_3d config, replacing the qutrit kets with qubit GHZ kets.
