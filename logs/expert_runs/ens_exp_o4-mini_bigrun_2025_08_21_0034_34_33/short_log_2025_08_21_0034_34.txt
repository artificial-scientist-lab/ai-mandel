SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration follows the researcher's specification exactly: a single interferometer mixing three atom‐emitter photons and four ancilla photons, with different two‐click herald patterns teleporting either CNOT or SWAP. We set in_nodes for the emitter photons, out_nodes for the returned photons, heralding_out true so only ancilla clicks are measured, and include the eight target strings encoding the programmable mapping.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and single_emitters overlapped. The atoms’ photons are logical inputs, so they go in in_nodes, and not as single_emitters. The ancilla photons come from SPDC (num_anc), so there are no single_emitters. I’ll remove single_emitters and set out_nodes to [3,4,5] to send the teleported photons back to atoms.
