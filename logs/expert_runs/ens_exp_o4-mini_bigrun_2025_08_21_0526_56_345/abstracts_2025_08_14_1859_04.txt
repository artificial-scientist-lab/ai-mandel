Title: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits

Abstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT₍A→B₎ or SWAP₍A↔B₎ gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds—without cavities or active feed-forward—this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.
