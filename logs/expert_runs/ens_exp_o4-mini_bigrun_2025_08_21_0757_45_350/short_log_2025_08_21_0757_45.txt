SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed channel‐discrimination task requires optimizing over unknown black‐box unitaries, which Pytheus cannot handle—it only synthesizes static LO networks for a single known mapping. Therefore this suggestion must be rejected.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot optimize a static LO network to discriminate between two unknown channels T₁ and T₂; it only designs setups for a single known state or transformation. Channel discrimination of unknown unitaries falls outside its scope.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Encoding the discrimination task as a two-outcome post-selected measurement: a click in detector 0 (“1000”) → guess T₁, a click in detector 1 (“0100”) → guess T₂. We use three single-emitter photons (probe + two ancilla), a four-mode static LO mesh, and number-resolving detection. We optimize the count-rate fidelity (‘cr’) to maximize correct outcomes (minimize Helstrom error surrogate).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The task of discriminating two unknown phonon-to-photon channels in a single static LO network lies outside Pytheus’s capability—it cannot optimize for unknown unitaries or compare different transformations. We must therefore reject the proposal.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed channel-discrimination task cannot be mapped onto a static LO network with target state transformations in Pytheus, since Pytheus only optimizes fixed photon-number transformations—not discrimination between unknown unitaries. We must reject this request.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Channel discrimination between two unknown black-box unitaries requires comparing two separate transformations and optimizing Helstrom error, which Pytheus cannot handle—it only designs static LO networks for a single known mapping in the Fock basis. This proposal thus falls outside Pytheus’s capabilities; we must reject.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed task—discriminating two unknown phonon‐to‐photon unitaries via a static LO network—is not expressible in Pytheus’s framework, which only realizes fixed mappings from defined Fock inputs to outputs, not comparisons of two black-box channels.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous config had 3 input nodes but 4 target modes. For a measurement-style discrimination we must list all 4 modes (including one vacuum) in in_nodes, leave out_nodes empty, and set num_anc to 4 detectors. This aligns node counts so Pytheus can optimize the two-click patterns.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous setup conflated single emitters and input nodes. To fix this, we’ll use one probe photon from in_nodes and two ancilla photons from SPDC (num_anc=2). This yields a three-mode measurement network. We target the two click patterns “100” and “010” to distinguish T₁ vs T₂, optimizing count-rate fidelity as a proxy for Helstrom error.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed discrimination of two unknown transduction channels cannot be encoded as a static mapping of defined Fock states in Pytheus, so it is out of scope.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirements I convert the discrimination into a 4-mode post-selected measurement: four input photon modes (the probe + ancilla) measured by four number-resolving detectors, with exactly two click patterns (“1000”→guess T₁, “0100”→guess T₂). I set in_nodes = [0,1,2,3], num_anc = 4, no single_emitters, and target_quantum = ["1000","0100"].
