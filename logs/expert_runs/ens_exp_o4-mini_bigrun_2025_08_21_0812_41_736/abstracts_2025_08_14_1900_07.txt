Title: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network

Mini‐abstract: We implement a fully static linear‐optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon‐pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla‐assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern “110110,” corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.
