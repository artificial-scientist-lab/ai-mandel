Title: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary‐Time Filtering for GHZ₃ Entanglement Swapping

Abstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three‐mode imaginary‐time evolution operator K∝exp[–β(σₓ⊗σᵧ⊗σ_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H₃ directly into a three‐party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, two single‐photon ancillas, linear‐optical elements and heralded post‐selection, our scheme teleports a “cooled” GHZ₃ state—thereby realizing an irreducible three‐body imaginary‐time filter within a scalable quantum network.
