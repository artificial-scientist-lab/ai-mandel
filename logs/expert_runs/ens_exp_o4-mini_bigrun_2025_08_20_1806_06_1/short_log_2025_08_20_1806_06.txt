Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration faithfully encodes a post-selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for Wigner-negativity preservation: we have one input mode at Alice (in_node=0), one output mode at Bob (out_node=2), four ancilla detectors (3–6) with heralding_out=true, removed_connections to block any direct 0→2 link, loss_func set to 'fid' to optimize teleportation fidelity, and number-resolving detectors enabled. This aligns with the researcher's specifications and is ready for Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Fix node indexing: in_nodes [0], out_nodes [1], ancilla inputs as single_emitters [2,3,4,5], ban direct 0→1 link, keep target_quantum length 2 for identity teleportation, herald only ancilla detectors, contiguous node indices 0–5.
