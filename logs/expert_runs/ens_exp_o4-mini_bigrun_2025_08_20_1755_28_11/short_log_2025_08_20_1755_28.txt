Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s proposal is to implement a heralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation, using two single‐photon emitters (control and target), two SPDC Bell‐pair resources (implicit in num_anc), a static linear‐optical network, and post‐select only the identity‐correction Bell‐measurement outcomes. We encode this as a heralded CNOT gate (target_quantum = standard CNOT map), input qubits at nodes [0,1], output qubits at nodes [2,3], with four ancilla photons heralding the gate. We ask Pytheus to optimize the network for maximal success probability ('cr') and worst‐case entangling power will be reflected in enforcing the CNOT truth table. All parameters stay true to the researcher’s suggestion.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I mistakenly listed the input qubit modes as single_emitters. In Pytheus, single_emitters are only for ancilla photon sources, and must be disjoint from in_nodes. I’ll remove single_emitters, so the input control and target qubits come via in_nodes, and the four ancilla photons come from SPDC (num_anc). Then everything is disjoint and consistent with the researcher’s suggestion.
