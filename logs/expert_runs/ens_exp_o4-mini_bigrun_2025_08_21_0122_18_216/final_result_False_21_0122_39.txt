}###Title:  
Entanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z₂-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop

Mini-Abstract:  
In the Z₂-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and π, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z₂ flux via entanglement-swapping interference.
