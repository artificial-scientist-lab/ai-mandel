Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s target is a static Bell-vs-GHZ analyzer using two ancilla “program” photons on modes 5 and 6 and a single network on modes 0–6, distinguishing four Bell inputs and eight GHZ inputs via 12 detectors. I’ll correct the JSON syntax (use “thresholds”, proper 7-digit Fock strings, `num_anc=12` detectors), keep `in_nodes=[0..6]`, `out_nodes=[]`, and call pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates in_nodes and single_emitters must not overlap. I’ll remove ancilla modes from in_nodes (keep only signal modes 0–4) and correctly list the 7-mode Fock strings for the two-qubit (ancilla=10) and three-qubit (ancilla=01) computational-basis tasks. Then call pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target_quantum strings must match the fixed in_nodes size (seven total input modes 0–6). I’ll treat the Bell vs GHZ analyzer as a measurement task: all seven photons (signal plus program bits) are input, no ancilla generation, and seven detectors measure them. We list twelve length-7 Fock strings (four Bell inputs with program-bit=10 and eight GHZ inputs with program-bit=01), set in_nodes=[0..6], out_nodes=[], num_anc=7 (detectors), and call pytheus.
