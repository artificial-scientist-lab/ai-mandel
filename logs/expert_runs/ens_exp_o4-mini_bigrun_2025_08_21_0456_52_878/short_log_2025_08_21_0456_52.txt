Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modifications have been incorporated into a valid Pytheus configuration for a heralded, nondestructive identity channel on two modes using two-mode squeezed ancillas. All keys correctly reflect the experiment (identity mapping on modes 0,1, two ancilla pair sources, heralding detectors at 4,5, removed connections to enforce nonlocal ancilla sourcing, number-resolving detection, etc.). Now I will call Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that the configuration needs the “tries_per_edge” field. I will add "tries_per_edge": 5 to the config and retry.
