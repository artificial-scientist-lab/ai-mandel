Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed configuration correctly encodes the three-photon repetition-code teleportation with majority-vote decoding, heralded post-selection on six ancilla detectors, and enforces no A→C direct paths. I will now run Pytheus with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that out_nodes was incorrectly set to [8], causing a non-contiguous node indexing. I will change out_nodes to [3] and update removed_connections accordingly to forbid direct A→C links, ensuring nodes {0,1,2,3} are contiguous.
