}###Title: One‐Shot Repetition‐Code‐Assisted Linear‐Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase‐Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration

Mini‐abstract: We propose a three‐node, one‐shot linear‐optical teleportation network augmented by a three‐photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase‐damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase φ. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell‐state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority‐vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0⟩+e^{iφ}|1⟩ onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.
