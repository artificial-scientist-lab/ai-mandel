Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target is a cyclic teleportation router for three qubits using three EPR ancillas and post-selected Bell measurements, mapping |i,j,k>→|k,i,j>. We set num_anc=3, in_nodes=[0,1,2], out_nodes=[3,4,5], heralding_out=true, and supply the eight six-digit basis mappings. Now run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because SPDC sources can only create pairs of ancilla photons, so specifying an odd num_anc=3 leads to an odd total node count. To fix this, use single-photon emitters for the three ancillas by specifying single_emitters=[6,7,8].
