Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects a photonic state-generation task that compresses a d-dimensional and a qubit Bell pair into a two-qubit Bell state on modes 0 and 3, using four ancilla photons and heralded detection, with forbidden direct source links between modes 0 and 3. I will send this to Pytheus for optimization.
