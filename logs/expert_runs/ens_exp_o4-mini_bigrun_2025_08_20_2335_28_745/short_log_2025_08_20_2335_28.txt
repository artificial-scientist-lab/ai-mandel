Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s proposal: it maps dual-rail input on modes 0–1 to dual-rail output on modes 8–9, uses 8 ancilla photons, forbids direct input–output connections, and optimizes fidelity in post-selected fashion without feedback. Now we call Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (10) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because target_quantum strings included ancilla modes; they should only specify in+out nodes. I’ll reduce target_quantum to 4-digit strings mapping |10>→|10> and |01>→|01>.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus expects the union of in_nodes and out_nodes to cover all modes in target_quantum. Ancilla SPDC modes are not part of these nodes. I will map dual-rail input modes [0,1] to dual-rail output modes [2,3], use four-digit target strings, forbid direct input→output paths, and keep num_anc for SPDC ancillas.
