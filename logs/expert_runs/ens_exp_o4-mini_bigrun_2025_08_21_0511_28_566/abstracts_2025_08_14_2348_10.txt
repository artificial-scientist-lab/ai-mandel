Title: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information

Mini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus—comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors—to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I₃(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I₃(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.
