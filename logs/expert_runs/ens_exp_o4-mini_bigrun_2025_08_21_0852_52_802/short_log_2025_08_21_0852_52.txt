PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The discrete-basis specification forced in_nodes/out_nodes to cover all vertex indices, causing the contiguity error. Switching to a Fock-basis representation with explicit photon-number kets lets us omit in_nodes/out_nodes and satisfy Pytheus’s node handling. We keep the two-mode Fock states over four spatial modes, enforce the SSH forbidden links via removed_connections, and herald on the two ancilla photons.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target superposition had inconsistent photon numbers and I was still using the discrete‐variable loss function, so Pytheus refused the format. By switching to a Fock‐basis with constant photon number (two photons) across four spatial modes and using the 'fockcr' loss function, we keep the original forbidden SSH links and heralded ancilla detection, while satisfying Pytheus’s requirements.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Use a dual‐rail Fock representation to realize the Bell state across four modes (corner rails 0–1 and 2–3), keep the two-photon total photon number constant, switch to loss_func 'fockcr', preserve the SSH forbidden links, and herald the two ancilla clicks.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The discrete‐variable mapping was causing node‐contiguity errors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The discrete‐variable layout with in/out nodes was causing contiguity errors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((1, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 4 total kets with non-zero contributions.

(truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The root issue was mismatched node counts and odd total photon number; switching to a dual‐rail discrete Fock encoding over four spatial modes and specifying the Bell state as ["1010","0101"] (two photons total) with two ancilla photons (num_anc=2) restores even total photon number (4) and aligns indices for removed_connections.
