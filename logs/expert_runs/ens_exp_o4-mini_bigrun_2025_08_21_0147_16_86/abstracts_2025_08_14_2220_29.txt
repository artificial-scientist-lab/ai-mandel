Title: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions

Mini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres–Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101—which satisfy the square’s row/column parity constraints—this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.
