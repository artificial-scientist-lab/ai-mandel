    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps). Their click pattern yields two classical bits (b1,b2).\n4) Layer B (Floquet step 2): beam splitters couple next-nearest neighbors (0\u20132) and (2\u20134).\n5) Final detectors at modes 0 & 4 post-select on (b1,b2) to herald a Bell pair across the chain\u2019s ends.\nBy varying the BS reflectivities in A and B, one finds a threshold reflectivity regime above which the heralded concurrence between modes 0 and 4 abruptly jumps from zero to nonzero\u2014a photonic measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps). Their click pattern yields two classical bits (b1,b2).\n4) Layer B (Floquet step 2): beam splitters couple next-nearest neighbors (0\u20132) and (2\u20134).\n5) Final detectors at modes 0 & 4 post-select on (b1,b2) to herald a Bell pair across the chain\u2019s ends.\nBy varying the BS reflectivities in A and B, one finds a threshold reflectivity regime above which the heralded concurrence between modes 0 and 4 abruptly jumps from zero to nonzero\u2014a photonic measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps). Their click pattern yields two classical bits (b1,b2).\n4) Layer B (Floquet step 2): beam splitters couple next-nearest neighbors (0\u20132) and (2\u20134).\n5) Final detectors at modes 0 & 4 post-select on (b1,b2) to herald a Bell pair across the chain\u2019s ends.\nBy varying the BS reflectivities in A and B, one finds a threshold reflectivity regime above which the heralded concurrence between modes 0 and 4 abruptly jumps from zero to nonzero\u2014a photonic measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to combine \u201chybrid quantum\u2013classical\u201d with \u201cFloquet dynamic\u201d without targeting pure state generation:\n  a) A small photonic chain with alternating \u201cFloquet\u201d coupling layers interleaved by ancilla measurements, exhibiting a measurement-induced entanglement percolation transition. Classical heralding bits from ancilla detectors define whether long-range entanglement percolates across the chain.\n  b) A triangular loop of single-photon emitters with three Floquet steps that cyclically permute modes; ancilla detectors at each step record classical bits that program which two nodes end up entangled\u2014implements a measurement-controlled Floquet permutation network.\n  c) A star network where a central node repeatedly couples to leaf nodes in two Floquet periods; ancilla measurements at the center generate a classical binary program that routes entanglement to a chosen leaf pair.  \n\nStep 2: Check novelty and feasibility:\n  a) No prior Pytheus experiment has aimed at a measurement-induced percolation or entanglement transition in a driven chain. It uses static BS layers and ancilla post\u2010selection only.  \n  b) The cyclic permutation router is similar to programmable routing circuits already explored.  \n  c) The star routing resembles previous router ideas.  \n\nStep 3: Choose (a).  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates, in a minimal linear-optical network, a Floquet-driven measurement-induced percolation transition: by tuning beam-splitter reflectivities in two alternating layers and post-selecting on ancilla measurement outcomes, one observes a threshold behavior in the emergence of long-range Bell pairs across the ends of a chain.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires single-photon emitters, two static beam-splitter layers (the two Floquet steps), ancilla detectors for post-selection (hybrid classical bits), removed_connections to forbid direct source\u2192both ends, and no dynamic feedback. One can generalize to longer chains and more Floquet periods.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexperiment_name: MIPT_FloquetChain5_2step\nexplanation: \"We propose a 5-mode photonic chain where two alternating beam-splitter layers implement one period of a Floquet drive; ancilla detectors between and after the layers realize a measurement-induced percolation of entanglement:\n1) Single-photon emitters 0\u20134 generate the main chain modes; emitters 5 and 6 generate two ancilla photons.\n2) Layer A (Floquet step 1): beam splitters couple nearest neighbors (0\u20131), (1\u20132), (2\u20133), (3\u20134).\n3) Ancilla detectors at output nodes 5 & 6 measure the two ancilla photons (after coupling into modes 1 & 3 via small BS taps).

Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).\nThis error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.\n\nTo figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.",
