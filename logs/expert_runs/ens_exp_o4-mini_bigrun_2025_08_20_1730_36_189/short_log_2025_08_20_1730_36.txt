SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration accurately captures the two independent SPDC sources feeding modes 0–1 and 2–3, the static Bell‐state measurement at node B (modes 1–2) heralded by four ancilla clicks, and leaves modes 0 and 3 as the output (entangled) modes with heralding_out=true. All key Pytheus parameters are correctly set to implement the bilocality test network as specified.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. For a post‐selected state generation (entanglement swapping) we should treat the four SPDC‐born photons as internal inputs and leave in_nodes empty so the two final modes are implicitly the output. Setting in_nodes=[] and out_nodes=[] resolves the conflict while preserving the heralded entanglement‐swapping bilocality test.
