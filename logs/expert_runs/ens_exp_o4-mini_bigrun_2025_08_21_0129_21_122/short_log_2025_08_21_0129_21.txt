SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We target a d²=4 → d×d splitting, generating two 2-dim Bell pairs ['0000','1100','0011','1111'] with no incoming photons (all created by sources/emitters), one single-photon ancilla, four herald detectors on the metasurface, and we forbid the ancilla source from sending to any of the four output ports so it only contributes to heralding.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to an odd total number of photons. By switching the ancilla from a single-photon emitter to a single SPDC pair (num_anc=2), we restore even parity. Additionally, the target vector must cover the 8 modes for two qubit Bell pairs, giving two strings of length 8. I’ll update the configuration accordingly.
