}###Title:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement‐Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  

Abstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d²-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A–C and B–D, targeting the coherent “dimension splitting” of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d²+1)×(d²+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.
