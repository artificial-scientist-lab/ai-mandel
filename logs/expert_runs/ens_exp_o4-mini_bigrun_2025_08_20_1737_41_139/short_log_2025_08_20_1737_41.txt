Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Using the proposed SSH‐corner entanglement swapping configuration—with two SPDC sources, post‐selective Bell measurements on interior nodes, heralded ancilla outcomes, Bell‐pair target on corners 0 and 3, and forbidden diagonal connections—I’ll run Pytheus to generate the linear‐optics setup.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because our discrete-variable kets and node indices weren’t aligned. To include interior nodes (4,5) and corners (0–3), the target kets must span all 6 modes. Instead, I’ll switch to a Fock‐basis representation of a dual‐rail Bell‐state (one photon per qubit) across 4 spatial modes (corners 0 and 3 are opposite rails) plus two ancilla modes for the interior Bell measurements. That means 4 output modes (0–3) and 2 ancilla detectors (4,5), so 6 modes total. I’ll encode the Bell pair as Fock patterns [[1,0,0,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0,0,0]] (i.e., photon at corner-0 & corner-3 vs corner-1 & corner-2), herald the interior clicks on modes 4 and 5, and forbid non‐SSH edges among the 4 corners.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirements I’ll switch to a Fock‐basis search using ‘fockfid’ to directly target the two‐photon Bell pair across corner modes (0 and 3) with two ancilla photons heralded on modes 4 and 5. I’ll include explicit amplitudes, forbid the SSH diagonal links via removed_connections, and enable heralding and number‐resolving detection.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempt failed likely due to insufficient ancilla photons under stringent removed_connection constraints. To give Pytheus enough freedom, I'll increase the ancilla count to 4 (two SPDC pairs), target the dual-rail Bell state between corners 0 and 3 in Fock basis with 'fockcr', and enforce only the SSH‐diagonal forbiddance.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous failures stemmed from mismatched node indices and inconsistent mode counts. I'll switch to a discrete-variable, high-dimensional “qudit” encoding: teleportation creates a two‐photon Bell pair across the four corner modes (0–3) with patterns "03" and "12". We inject the qubit via a single‐photon emitter at node 0, use two SPDC ancilla pairs (num_anc=2) for the interior Bell measurements (heralded), and forbid diagonal SSH links via removed_connections. Only mode 3 is the final output; the rest are measured.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirements, I’ll request a post‐selected Bell-pair generation across the four corner modes [0–3], use four ancilla photons (two SPDC pairs) for the interior Bell measurements (heralded), and forbid only the diagonal SSH-style links via removed_connections.
