Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration translates the remote CNOT transformation into a heralded linear-optical network with 4 ancilla photons (two Bell-pair sources) and enforces nonlocality by forbidding any common source between the two input qubits. It uses postselection with number-resolving detectors and static delays implicitly encoded via the dual-rail time-bin mapping.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates removed_connections must reference detection nodes. To enforce nonlocality, forbid a single SPDC source connecting the two output detectors at nodes 2 and 3. I'll set removed_connections to [[2,3]].
