SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s teleportation router proposal, with one single-photon emitter at A, four SPDC ancilla photons, heralded ancilla detection, blockers on direct A→B/C links, and the discrete‐variable target mapping ["110","101"] with equal amplitudes. I will now run it through pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because I mistakenly declared the input qubit both as an incoming photon and a single emitter at the same index. In fact, the unknown qubit at A should be treated as an input (in_nodes) rather than from a single-emitter. I'll remove the single_emitters entry and retry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because out_nodes indices were not contiguous; reindex the output nodes to [1,2] so the union of in_nodes and out_nodes is [0,1,2]. Remove removed_connections to avoid invalid links.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd‐photon‐number error stems from using single‐rail encoding, where kets had non‐constant photon numbers. Converting to dual‐rail encoding (two modes per qubit) makes each ket sum to the same total photons (2), so fidelity loss works. We use 2 input modes, 4 output modes, and 4 ancilla (two SPDC pairs), herald ancilla only.
