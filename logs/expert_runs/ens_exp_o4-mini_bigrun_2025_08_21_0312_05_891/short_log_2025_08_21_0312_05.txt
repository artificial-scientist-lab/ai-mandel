Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The abstract suggestion requires encoding two sequential entanglement swaps with one ancilla Bell pair recycled via a delay loop. Pytheus can’t inherently handle “time bins,” but we model t₁↔t₂ as a two‐dimensional mode (“dimensions”: [2]) and introduce one loop. We declare one probabilistic pair source (num_anc=2) at nodes 4&5, four single‐photon emitters for the unknown qubit pairs ([0–3]), one loop from output node 5 back to input node 4 with delay=1 (emulating temporal reuse), and list the eight heralding two‐click patterns in target_quantum. All other parameters follow Pytheus conventions.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because single_emitters overlapped with default out_nodes. To fix, classify the unknown qubits as in_nodes rather than single_emitters, leaving single_emitters empty. Explicitly set in_nodes and out_nodes to avoid defaults.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To encode the eight two‐click detection patterns across two time bins, I treat all eight detection events as incoming “nodes” and define eight bitstring patterns in target_quantum, each with two clicks. I set num_anc=8 (eight detectors), no out_nodes, and dimensions=[2] to signal the two temporal modes. Loops omitted (static measurement). This strictly matches the suggestion: eight heralding two‐click patterns in two sequential time bins.
