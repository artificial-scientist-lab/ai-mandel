Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Z-parity projector on the central pair (B,C) is simplest to encode first. I’ll configure a heralded even‐parity measurement (|00>+|11>) on modes 0 and 1, using one ancilla photon and heralding only on the ancilla detector so that the surviving photons in nodes 0,1 implement M_Z.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to using the same nodes for inputs and outputs. For a measurement module, we should list the BC modes as `in_nodes` and leave `out_nodes` empty so both are detected. Also index ancilla as node 4. I'll correct the indices and remove `out_nodes`.

Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose from misusing `in_nodes`/`out_nodes` overlap and non‐contiguous indexing. For a heralded measurement we keep the two signal modes distinct, have them map to fresh output modes, and detect only ancilla photons. We therefore define a two‐qubit parity projector: target_map = |00>→|00| and |11>→|11|, with `in_nodes` = [0,1], `out_nodes` = [2,3], and `heralding_out`=true. Using SPDC ancillas (no single_emitters) gives two ancilla detectors (`num_anc`=2). The node list [0,1,2,3] is contiguous. This should fix the implementation.
