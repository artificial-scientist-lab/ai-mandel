SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration correctly encodes a heralded 1→2 qutrit telecloner: it maps one input qutrit at node 0 to two output qutrits at nodes 1 and 2 with basis mappings |0〉→|00〉, |1〉→|11〉, |2〉→|22〉, uses three ancilla photons (nodes 3–5) for the Bell measurement, and heralds success by detecting only the ancillas. All parameters are within Pytheus’s static linear‐optical capabilities. I will now run the tool with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The attempted 1→2 qutrit telecloning map cannot be realized by Pytheus as a single static linear-optical transformation because we cannot increase the number of surviving (undetected) photons from one input plus ancillas to two output clones—there is a fundamental photon-number mismatch. No choice of ancilla count or heralding flag resolves that, so this target is not implementable in the current Pytheus framework.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The 3‐ancilla configuration seems insufficient for a heralded 1→2 qutrit telecloner. I'll increase the ancilla count to 4 and add a fourth ancilla detector to give Pytheus more freedom.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempts failed due to parity and feasibility issues. I'll increase ancillas to 5 so the total photon number is even (1+2+5=8) and include num_pre. This should give Pytheus enough freedom.
