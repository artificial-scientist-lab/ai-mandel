Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested JSON mapped the researcher’s idea but misassigned ancilla photons. In this heralded entanglement‐swapping experiment there are no extra ancilla SPDC photons—only the four incoming photons are used, two become heralding detections and two remain as outputs. We set num_anc to 0, in_nodes to [0,1,2,3], out_nodes to [0,3], and heralding_out to true.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to correct in_nodes/out_nodes and num_anc to match a heralded entanglement swapping: no incoming preexisting photons (in_nodes=[]), two output modes (default all nodes), four ancilla photons from the two SPDC sources (num_anc=4), heralding_out=true, and forbid any SPDC linking A–D directly via removed_connections [[0,1]].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We must configure a heralded creation of a 3‐dimensional Bell state between nodes A and D via two SPDC sources and two Bell measurements, each using 2 ancilla photons. Use no incoming nodes, output default all target photons, 4 ancillas, heralding_out true, no topology restrictions.
