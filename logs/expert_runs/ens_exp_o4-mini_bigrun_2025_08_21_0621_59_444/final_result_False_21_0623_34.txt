}###Title: “Distributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms”

Mini-Abstract:  
We demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d×d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.
