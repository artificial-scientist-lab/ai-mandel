Mini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target “Variational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.” Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.
