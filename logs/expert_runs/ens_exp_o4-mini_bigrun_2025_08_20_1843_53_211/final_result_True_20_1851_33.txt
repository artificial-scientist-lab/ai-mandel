}###Title: Path‐Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field

Mini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell‐state measurement with a multi‐path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B₁ and B₂. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete “quality factor” Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped‐entanglement fidelity of the target modes.
