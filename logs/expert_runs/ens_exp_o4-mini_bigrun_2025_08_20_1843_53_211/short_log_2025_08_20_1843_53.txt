Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the suggested path‐identity swap with three ancilla paths heralding a dual‐rail Bell state on modes 0–1. I'll run Pytheus to optimize the beam‐splitter network.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 0 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target strings are length-4, so we need four output modes, and separately three ancilla detectors. I’ll set out_nodes=[0,1,2,3], anc_detectors=[4,5,6], two SPDC sources (num_pre=2), one single photon emitter (single_emitters=[6]) to reach three ancilla photons, and num_anc=3. Then run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Ensure node indices are contiguous (0–4), match dual-rail target (4 modes), use two SPDC sources (num_pre=2) plus one single-photon emitter (single_emitters=[4]) to supply three ancilla photons, herald on ancilla detectors [2,3,4], set out_nodes=[0,1,2,3], and run Pytheus.
