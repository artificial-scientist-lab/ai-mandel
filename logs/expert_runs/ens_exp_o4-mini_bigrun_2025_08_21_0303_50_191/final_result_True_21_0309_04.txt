}###Title: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution

Abstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target state—two remote Bell pairs |Φ⁺〉_{A,C} ⊗ |Φ⁺〉_{B,D}—while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.
