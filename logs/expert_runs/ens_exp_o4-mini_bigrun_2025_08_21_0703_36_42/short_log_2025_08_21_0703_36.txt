Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The GHZ basis analyzer can be cast as a measurement supermap projecting onto |000⟩+|111⟩ by arranging nine detectors (three for inputs, two per HOM module, and three ancilla b_i), so we set num_anc=9, target_quantum=["000","111"], amplitudes=[1.0,1.0], in_nodes=[0,1,2], and no out_nodes. We'll let pytheus find the static linear-optic circuit.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 0), (14, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0), (13, 0), (14, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because we asked for an odd total number of photons when measuring both inputs and ancilla. Instead, we should leave the three unknown qubits as outputs (out_nodes), herald on the ancilla detections only (num_anc=6 from three SPDC pairs, num_pre=3), and project the inputs onto GHZ⁺. This gives six ancilla photons (even) to detect and leaves the three inputs heralded into the GHZ basis.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The total number of modes now matches inputs plus three SPDC pairs. I set num_anc=6 for the six ancilla photons, num_pre=3 SPDC sources, and left out_nodes empty so all photons (inputs+ancilla) are detected. Target kets length matches three input modes.
