}###Title: Entanglement Swapping of 2×2 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics

Abstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2×2 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0–3 and 12–15 onto the unnormalized target quantum state

heralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.
