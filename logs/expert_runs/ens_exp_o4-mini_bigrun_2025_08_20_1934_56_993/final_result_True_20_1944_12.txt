}###Title:  
Single-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T₁ and T₂, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.
