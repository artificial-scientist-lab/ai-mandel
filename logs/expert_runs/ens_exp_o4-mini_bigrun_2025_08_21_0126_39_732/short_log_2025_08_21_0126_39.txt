Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s protocol: two incoming SPDC Bell pairs on modes [0,1,2,3], four ancilla herald detectors [4–7], no feedback, a post‐selected Bell outcome, and a target maximally entangled state on outputs [0,3] with removed cross‐connections. I’ll submit this to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The in_nodes/out_nodes overlap error arises because this network originates all photons internally via SPDC. We should leave both in_nodes and out_nodes empty and rely on num_anc=4 to indicate the four damping‐herald detectors. The two Bell measurement detectors become part of the “output” and are enforced by target_quantum on the two remaining modes. Updated config below.
