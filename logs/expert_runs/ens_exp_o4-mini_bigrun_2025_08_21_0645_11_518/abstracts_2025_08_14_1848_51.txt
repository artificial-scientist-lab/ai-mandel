Title:  
Heralded Mid‐Gap Bell‐Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  

Mini‐abstract:  
We implement a linear‐optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two‐pair) and weak (single‐pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell‐state measurements at each non‐central node.  Post‐selection on successful heralds yields a mid‐gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain’s photonic mid‐gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak‐bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification

Mini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.
