Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The user’s suggested static analyzer config was missing several required fields and had inconsistent node counts. I’ll fill in the optimizer, num_pre, ftol, and bulk_thr entries, add an explicit out_nodes list of length 5 to match the five detectors, and supply all fields in proper JSON form so Pytheus can run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (5) does not match number of in/out nodes (5 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target strings were length-5 but we declared 8 modes (3 inputs + 5 detectors). The length of each target string must equal the total number of modes (in_nodes + out_nodes). I will rewrite the five mapping strings as 8-bit patterns (3 input modes + 5 detectors), e.g. input “100” → detector0 at position 3 gives “10010000”, and so on.
