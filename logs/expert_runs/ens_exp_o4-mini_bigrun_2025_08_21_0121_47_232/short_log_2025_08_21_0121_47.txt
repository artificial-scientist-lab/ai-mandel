Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for the photon‐blockade–assisted entanglement purification network is complete. I'll now run Pytheus to design the experiment.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The overlap error comes from specifying input and output nodes. Instead, I’ll treat this as a state‐generation task (like entanglement swapping examples), omitting in_nodes/out_nodes so Pytheus will generate the purified Bell state |Φ⁺⟩ with two SPDC sources, two blockade emitters, and heralding detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus requires node indices to match the target‐quantum string length. Following the entanglement‐swapping examples, I’ll treat this as a state‐generation task: two SPDC pair sources plus two ancilla detections yield the purified |Φ⁺⟩. I omit single_emitters (photon blockade is abstracted) and set num_anc=2, num_pre=1, unicolor=true.
