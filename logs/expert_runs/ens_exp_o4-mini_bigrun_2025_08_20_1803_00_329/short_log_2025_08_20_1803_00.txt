Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration correctly encodes the dual-rail input-to-output teleportation mapping with eight ancillary photons, forbidding direct connections between input and output to enforce the EAQECC‐teleportation structure. I will invoke pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (10) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch arose because we specified 8 ancilla but only 6 zeros in the target strings. We need 2 in + 8 ancilla + 2 out = 12 modes. Update the target strings to length 12 and set out_nodes=[10,11].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target transformation should specify only the logical input/output modes, not include ancilla. Hence target strings must be length 4 (2 in + 2 out), and out_nodes should be [2,3]. I will update target_quantum to ["1010","0101"] and removed_connections to [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]] while keeping num_anc=8.
