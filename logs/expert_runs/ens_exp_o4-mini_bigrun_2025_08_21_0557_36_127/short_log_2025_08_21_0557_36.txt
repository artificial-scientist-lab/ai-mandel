PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The prior SWAP‐test approach was mis‐specified for Pytheus; instead I’ll implement the simplest nontrivial “quantum‐metric classifier” for D=2, K=2 by routing basis states |0⟩,|1⟩ into two distinct output ports—a binary demultiplexer. This exactly classifies by minimal Fubini–Study distance to reference states |0⟩,|1⟩.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The demultiplexer classifier needs post-selection via an SPDC ancilla pair. We add two ancillas, detect them alongside routing output, and specify the correct Fock patterns for input|0>→port0 and input|1>→port1.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify to a binary qubit demultiplexer: deterministically route a single photon from input mode-0 to output mode-2, and from input mode-1 to output mode-3, implementing the simplest “metric classifier” for D=2, K=2 (closest to |0⟩ or |1⟩).
