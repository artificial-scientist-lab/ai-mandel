}###Title: Discrete Quantum‐Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP‐Test Network

Abstract: We implement a fixed linear‐optical network that routes a single unknown D‐level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP‐test and entanglement‐swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini–Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single‐click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum‐metric machine‐learning primitive.
