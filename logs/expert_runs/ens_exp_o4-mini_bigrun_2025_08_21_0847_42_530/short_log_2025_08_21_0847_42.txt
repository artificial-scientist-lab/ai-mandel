Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus requires that every photon entering (in_nodes or single_emitters) must exit via either an out_node or an ancilla detector. Here we had 3 input qubits + 2 single‐emitter ancillas = 5 inputs but only 2 ancilla photons, so num_anc must be at least 5 to close the device. We increase num_anc from 2 to 5.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The count‐rate loss requires perfect matchings and fails for odd photon number. Switching to fidelity loss (‘fid’) treats discrete states and avoids the perfect‐matching requirement. Keep 3 inputs + 2 ancillas (5 photons) in a 5×5 static interferometer, optimize fidelity for |000>+|111> projection.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy the perfect-matching requirement for ‘cr’ loss we need an even total photon number. We add one SPDC ancilla (num_anc=3) alongside our two single-emitters. This gives 3 inputs + 3 ancillas = 6 photons, enabling a static GHZ⁺ measurement.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirement that each input or single-emitter photon has a corresponding detector, I set num_anc to 5 and include two single-photon emitters for ancillas. This gives 3 inputs + 2 single‐emitters = 5 photons and 5 detectors. Now we target the static heralded |000⟩+|111⟩ projection with loss_func “cr.”
