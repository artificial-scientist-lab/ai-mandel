Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the abstract network steering GHZ‐swapping star: four SPDC sources, four ancilla detectors implementing a 4-photon GHZ projector, heralding_out to leave modes 0–3 as resource, removed_connections enforce star wiring, target_quantum is 4-qubit GHZ, using cr loss. Launch the pytheus search.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial wiring constraints were too restrictive or incorrect. For a pure SPDC‐based GHZ entangler, we must forbid any SPDC source sharing two remote modes or two ancilla modes, ensuring each source links one remote and one ancilla. We also follow the 2pES_3d style: no explicit in_nodes/out_nodes, heralding_out=true to keep remote modes as the resource, num_anc=4 ancilla detectors. Action: Invoke pytheus with updated removed_connections.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network constraints were too strict, making the heralded 4-photon GHZ projector unreachable with only 4 ancillas. I will relax the removed_connections to let Pytheus first find a GHZ projector, then later reintroduce star‐shaped wiring.
