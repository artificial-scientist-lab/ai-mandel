Abstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3→1 multipartite EPR-steering inequality—demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.
