Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modifications correctly translate the hybrid qubit–qutrit swap into PyTheus syntax, with the proper Fock-mode strings, forbidden direct connection, and ancilla settings. We'll run this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 1), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial discrete-variable config lacked viable matchings because it underestimated the photon budget and measurement heralding. To emulate ES_246, I’ll treat the hybrid Bell interface as a state generation: 2 SPDC sources produce 4 ancilla photons, which are measured (heralding_out=true), leaving the 2 output photons in the target qubit–qutrit Bell state. I forbid direct sources to both output qubit and output qutrit modes. This matches PyTheus’s discrete-variable state preparation examples.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch arose because the total number of modes (target length + ancilla) must be even for perfect matchings. I'll reduce to one ancilla (5+1=6 nodes) so an even graph. This minimal ancilla may allow PyTheus to find a heralded qubit–qutrit Bell generator.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The missing piece was specifying which photons are outputs so heralding_out works correctly. We'll declare out_nodes as [0,4] (qubit mode 0 and qutrit mode 4) so that the two ancilla photons are detected, enabling perfect matchings with num_anc=2.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The forbidden direct source constraint is blocking all solutions; let’s remove removed_connections and rerun with two SPDC ancilla (num_anc=2) and discrete-variable target strings ["10100","01001"] so PyTheus can find any heralded qubit–qutrit Bell state generator.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Reformulate as a heralded state‐generation problem: create the 2-photon qubit–qutrit Bell state across 5 modes with Fock-basis target [[1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1]] and amplitudes [1,1], using 2 SPDC ancillas that are detected (heralding_out=true). For a valid matching we forbid any direct SPDC to modes 0&4 via removed_connections. Use loss_func='fockfid' to optimize the superposition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy PyTheus’s requirement for an even total photon number and proper heralding, I recast the protocol as a heralded Fock‐state generation: two SPDC sources (num_anc=4 photons) produce ancillary photons that are all detected (heralding_out=true), leaving the two target photons in the qubit–qutrit Bell state across five modes. I remove overly restrictive constraints except the forbidden direct link between modes 0 and 4. I use loss_func=fockfid with amplitudes to enforce the equal superposition of the two Fock kets.
