}###Title:  
Heralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit–Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2×3 Bell Measurement

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2×3 Bell measurement on a shared qubit–qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit–qutrit Bell state ‖00⟩+eiφ‖12⟩/√2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.
