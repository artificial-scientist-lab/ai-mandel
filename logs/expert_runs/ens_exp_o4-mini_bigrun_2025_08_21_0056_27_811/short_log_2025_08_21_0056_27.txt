Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To implement the two‐plaquette boundary–scaling Z–stabilizer analyzer, I’ll target the simultaneous +1 syndromes for both plaquettes in a 2×1 patch of six qubits.  I’ll set up a measurement network with 6 ancilla photons (matching the patch perimeter L=6), no single emitters, no forbidden connections beyond the shared ancilla requirement, and use “cr” as the loss function.  The two syndrome bits (s₁,s₂) are read out in modes 0 and 1, so I list the four possible outcomes “00”,“01”,“10”,“11” as the target patterns.
