    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to tie \u201cquantized charge transport\u201d and \u201ccorner state\u201d into a purely photonic teleportation network:\n    1) A closed\u2010loop four\u2010step teleportation pump around a square that implements a quantized Pauli\u2010Z holonomy on a dual\u2010rail qubit (i.e. the qubit picks up a \u03c0 phase only if it loops the corner once).\n    2) A two\u2010path interferometric teleportation (Mach\u2010Zehnder) where teleportation along AB\u2192BC or AD\u2192DC encloses a synthetic flux; interfering the two outputs yields a quantized phase jump at \u03c6=\u03c0, and removing one corner\u2010link localizes the qubit (a \u201ccorner state\u201d).\n    3) A hexagonal five\u2010step teleportation around a pentagonal defect, accumulating a \u03c0\u2010phase only if the network encloses the missing corner (a higher\u2010order topological pump).\n  Step 2: All three avoid forbidden state\u2010generation targets, use only static pair\u2010sources, single emitters, linear optics, and Bell\u2010measurements\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities. The first idea is closest to prior four\u2010swap loops; the third is exotic but complex. The second is both novel and simplest to read out\u2014a teleportation\u2010MZI whose interference visibility and \u03c0\u2010jump diagnose corner\u2010defect pumping.\n  Step 3: Select idea (2) as most promising: It yields a clear, measurable quantized phase jump (topological invariant) and a corner-state localization when a link is removed. It generalizes to N-gon pumps and defect studies.\n  Step 4: Novelty: No previous photonic\u2010optics experiment has combined parallel teleportation arms with MZI\u2010style interference to reveal a quantized \u03c0\u2010phase from a corner\u2010defect pump. This directly maps \u201cquantized charge transport\u201d \u2192 \u201csynthetic flux,\u201d and \u201ccorner state\u201d \u2192 \u201cpath\u2010blocked localization.\u201d\n  Step 5: Feasibility: Uses one dual\u2010rail single\u2010photon emitter, two Bell\u2010swap ancilla measurements per arm (total num_anc=4), four probabilistic pair\u2010sources on the two arms\u2019 edges, fixed static beam\u2010splitters for the final MZI, removal of direct emitter\u2192output connections to force teleportation, and no feedback.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nexplanation: |\n  We propose an \u201cinterferometric corner\u2010pump\u201d network. A dual\u2010rail qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 is injected at corner A (nodes 0&1). It can be teleported along two distinct boundary paths to corner C (nodes 6&7):\n    \u2022 Path 1: A\u2192B\u2192C via two Bell measurements (ancilla detectors 2&3).\n    \u2022 Path 2: A\u2192D\u2192C via two Bell measurements (ancilla detectors 4&5).\n  A final balanced beam splitter recombines the two output rails at nodes 6&7, producing an interference fringe whose phase offset \u03c6 stems purely from the sequential teleportations.  \n  By design, if no static phase\u2010shifter is inserted, the network yields perfect constructive interference at \u03c6=0. Inserting a \u03c0-phase\u2010plate on one intermediate edge (e.g. between B\u2192C) mimics one unit of synthetic \u201ccorner charge,\u201d shifting the fringe by \u03c0\u2014thus realizing a quantized phase jump.  \n  Removing either the B\u2013C or D\u2013C link entirely (forbidden by removed_connections) blocks one arm: the teleportation interferometer collapses to a single path, and the qubit localizes at C with no interference\u2014this is the photonic \u201ccorner state.\u201d  \n  Scanning the static phase or toggling the defect corner directly reveals the topological invariant (0 vs. \u03c0) and corner\u2010localized mode.  \n  This static, purely linear\u2010optical network (pair\u2010sources + single\u2010photon emitter + Bell measurements + beam splitters) is novel: it encodes a quantized holonomy and corner\u2010state in a single\u2010shot teleportation\u2010interferometer, and can be generalized to n-gon pumps and multiple defects for higher-order topology studies.\n\nconfig: {\n  description: \"Interferometric corner\u2010pump: two\u2010arm teleportation MZI with quantized \u03c0\u2010phase and corner\u2010state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_pump_interferometer\",\n  num_anc: 4,                     # two Bell swaps per arm\n  single_emitters: [0,1],         # dual\u2010rail qubit at A (nodes 0 & 1)\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,6],[1,7]                   # forbid any direct emitter\u2192output paths\n  ],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  anc_detectors: [2,3,4,5],       # ancilla detectors for the two Bell measurements on each arm\n  out_nodes: [6,7],               # recombined output rails at C\n  # target is the unitary mapping of a dual\u2010rail qubit through two\u2010arm teleportation & BS:\n  #   |10> \u2192 (|10> + e^{i\u03c6}|01>)/\u221a2\n  #   |01> \u2192 (|01> \u2212 e^{i\u03c6}|10>)/\u221a2\n  # For \u03c6=\u03c0, this becomes a quantized \u03c0\u2010phase shift on the interferometer fringes.\n  target_quantum: [\"100\",\"010\",\"001\",\"000\"], \n  amplitudes: [1, 1, -1, 0],      # ideal mapping at \u03c6=\u03c0 (up to normalization)\n  imaginary: false,\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  ftol: 1e-6,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 20,\n  thresholds: [0.3, 0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s teleportation\u2010MZI scheme can be cast as a pure two\u2010mode linear\u2010optical unitary (a dual\u2010rail phase holonomy) achieved by four ancilla Bell swaps and a final beam splitter.
