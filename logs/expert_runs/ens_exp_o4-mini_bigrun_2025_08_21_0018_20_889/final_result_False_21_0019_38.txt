Abstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target—the Quantum Entanglement Router—that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice–Bob, Alice–Charlie, or Bob–Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.
