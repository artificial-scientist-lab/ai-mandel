    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I need to propose a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network experiment\u2014no state\u2010generation targets\u2014that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \nStep 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:\n\n  1. A d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit\u2014i.e. design the Bell\u2010measurement plus post\u2010selection network so that negative \u201cphase\u2010point\u201d values survive the teleport.  \n  2. A two\u2010hop teleportation chain (Alice\u2192Charlie\u2192Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re\u2010inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of \u201cnegativity decay\u201d through successive linear\u2010optics teleportation steps.  \n  3. A network that interleaves a single\u2010mode non\u2010Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage\u2014even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement\u2010induced negativity can boost fidelity.  \n\nStep 3: Check novelty/obstacles:\n\n  1. The single\u2010hop qutrit case above is novel (no one\u2019s optimized a discrete\u2010Wigner\u2010negativity\u2013preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement\u2010swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors to implement a d\u2009=\u20093 Bell measurement and a post\u2010selected teleportation channel. It just needs \u201cin_node,\u201d \u201cout_node,\u201d \u201canc_detectors,\u201d \u201cremoved_connections,\u201d and \u201csingle_emitters\u201d or \u201cpair_sources.\u201d  \n  2. The two\u2010hop chain is more complex, effectively back\u2010to\u2010back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  \n  3. Interleaving non\u2010Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  \n\nStep 4: Pick idea 1.\n\nThis idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment has ever combined a d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network with an explicit figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. Bell\u2010measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity\u2010preservation\u2014and negativity is the signature of non\u2010classicality in phase\u2010space.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (to generate the pre\u2010shared Bell pair), number\u2010resolving detectors, post\u2010selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper\u2010entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \n\u201cInspired by the fundamental role of Wigner\u2010function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete\u2010variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear\u2010optics teleportation channel in dimension d\u2009=\u20093. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner\u2010negative test states.  \n\nExperiment sketch:  \n\u2013 Modes and parties:  \n   \u2022 Mode 0: Alice\u2019s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}).  \n   \u2022 Modes 1&2: Pre\u2010shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair\u2010source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  \n   \u2022 Modes 3\u20136: Four ancillary single photons (or pair\u2010source halves) injected at Alice\u2019s station for realizing a generalized d\u2009=\u20093 Bell\u2010state measurement by linear optics and number\u2010resolving detection.  \n   \u2022 Mode 7\u20138: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair\u2010sources for ancilla.  \n\n\u2013 Network architecture:  \n   1. At Alice: a linear\u2010optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3\u20136).  \n   2. Number\u2010resolving detectors on modes 3\u20136 post\u2010select one of the nine generalized Bell\u2010states. No active feed\u2010forward; we succeed only when a permitted click\u2010pattern occurs.  \n   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  \n\n\u2013 Constraints:  \n   \u2022 removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 \u2192 mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice\u2019s Bell measurement.  \n   \u2022 single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  \n   \u2022 anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  \n\n\u2013 Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner\u2010negative qutrit states, e.g.  \n   \u03a8\u2081 = (|0\u27e9 + |2\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9)/\u221a3,  \u03a8\u2082 = (|0\u27e9 + e^{2\u03c0i/3}|1\u27e9 + e^{\u22122\u03c0i/3}|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.  \nPytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for \u03a8\u2081 and \u03a8\u2082, which directly tests negativity\u2010preservation.  \n\nWhy this is exciting:  \n  \u2013 It bridges teleportation\u2014a paradigmatic quantum network primitive\u2014with the modern resource theory of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \n  \u2013 The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi\u2010hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  \n  \u2013 Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear\u2010optics teleporters for non\u2010Gaussianity could be a stand\u2010alone PRL.  \n\nWe ask Pytheus to search for the minimal\u2010ancilla, linear\u2010optics configuration that realizes a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner\u2010negativity\u2010state fidelity.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher wants a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for preserving discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. In Pytheus this is a map from in_node 0 to out_node 2 (identity channel for d=3), using four ancilla photons at Alice\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement and post\u2010selection (anc_detectors 3\u20136). We ban any direct in\u2192out path (removed_connections [[0,2]]), we herald only on ancilla detectors (heralding_out=true) so Bob\u2019s output photon remains free.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I need to propose a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network experiment\u2014no state\u2010generation targets\u2014that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \nStep 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:\n\n  1. A d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit\u2014i.e. design the Bell\u2010measurement plus post\u2010selection network so that negative \u201cphase\u2010point\u201d values survive the teleport.  \n  2. A two\u2010hop teleportation chain (Alice\u2192Charlie\u2192Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re\u2010inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of \u201cnegativity decay\u201d through successive linear\u2010optics teleportation steps.  \n  3. A network that interleaves a single\u2010mode non\u2010Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage\u2014even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement\u2010induced negativity can boost fidelity.  \n\nStep 3: Check novelty/obstacles:\n\n  1. The single\u2010hop qutrit case above is novel (no one\u2019s optimized a discrete\u2010Wigner\u2010negativity\u2013preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement\u2010swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors to implement a d\u2009=\u20093 Bell measurement and a post\u2010selected teleportation channel. It just needs \u201cin_node,\u201d \u201cout_node,\u201d \u201canc_detectors,\u201d \u201cremoved_connections,\u201d and \u201csingle_emitters\u201d or \u201cpair_sources.\u201d  \n  2. The two\u2010hop chain is more complex, effectively back\u2010to\u2010back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  \n  3. Interleaving non\u2010Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  \n\nStep 4: Pick idea 1.\n\nThis idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment has ever combined a d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network with an explicit figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. Bell\u2010measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity\u2010preservation\u2014and negativity is the signature of non\u2010classicality in phase\u2010space.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (to generate the pre\u2010shared Bell pair), number\u2010resolving detectors, post\u2010selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper\u2010entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \n\u201cInspired by the fundamental role of Wigner\u2010function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete\u2010variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear\u2010optics teleportation channel in dimension d\u2009=\u20093. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner\u2010negative test states.  \n\nExperiment sketch:  \n\u2013 Modes and parties:  \n   \u2022 Mode 0: Alice\u2019s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}).  \n   \u2022 Modes 1&2: Pre\u2010shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair\u2010source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  \n   \u2022 Modes 3\u20136: Four ancillary single photons (or pair\u2010source halves) injected at Alice\u2019s station for realizing a generalized d\u2009=\u20093 Bell\u2010state measurement by linear optics and number\u2010resolving detection.  \n   \u2022 Mode 7\u20138: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair\u2010sources for ancilla.  \n\n\u2013 Network architecture:  \n   1. At Alice: a linear\u2010optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3\u20136).  \n   2. Number\u2010resolving detectors on modes 3\u20136 post\u2010select one of the nine generalized Bell\u2010states. No active feed\u2010forward; we succeed only when a permitted click\u2010pattern occurs.  \n   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  \n\n\u2013 Constraints:  \n   \u2022 removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 \u2192 mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice\u2019s Bell measurement.  \n   \u2022 single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  \n   \u2022 anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  \n\n\u2013 Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner\u2010negative qutrit states, e.g.  \n   \u03a8\u2081 = (|0\u27e9 + |2\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9)/\u221a3,  \u03a8\u2082 = (|0\u27e9 + e^{2\u03c0i/3}|1\u27e9 + e^{\u22122\u03c0i/3}|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.  \nPytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for \u03a8\u2081 and \u03a8\u2082, which directly tests negativity\u2010preservation.  \n\nWhy this is exciting:  \n  \u2013 It bridges teleportation\u2014a paradigmatic quantum network primitive\u2014with the modern resource theory of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \n  \u2013 The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi\u2010hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  \n  \u2013 Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear\u2010optics teleporters for non\u2010Gaussianity could be a stand\u2010alone PRL.  \n\nWe ask Pytheus to search for the minimal\u2010ancilla, linear\u2010optics configuration that realizes a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner\u2010negativity\u2010state fidelity.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher wants a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for preserving discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. In Pytheus this is a map from in_node 0 to out_node 2 (identity channel for d=3), using four ancilla photons at Alice\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement and post\u2010selection (anc_detectors 3\u20136).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I need to propose a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network experiment\u2014no state\u2010generation targets\u2014that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \nStep 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:\n\n  1. A d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit\u2014i.e. design the Bell\u2010measurement plus post\u2010selection network so that negative \u201cphase\u2010point\u201d values survive the teleport.  \n  2. A two\u2010hop teleportation chain (Alice\u2192Charlie\u2192Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re\u2010inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of \u201cnegativity decay\u201d through successive linear\u2010optics teleportation steps.  \n  3. A network that interleaves a single\u2010mode non\u2010Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage\u2014even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement\u2010induced negativity can boost fidelity.  \n\nStep 3: Check novelty/obstacles:\n\n  1. The single\u2010hop qutrit case above is novel (no one\u2019s optimized a discrete\u2010Wigner\u2010negativity\u2013preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement\u2010swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors to implement a d\u2009=\u20093 Bell measurement and a post\u2010selected teleportation channel. It just needs \u201cin_node,\u201d \u201cout_node,\u201d \u201canc_detectors,\u201d \u201cremoved_connections,\u201d and \u201csingle_emitters\u201d or \u201cpair_sources.\u201d  \n  2. The two\u2010hop chain is more complex, effectively back\u2010to\u2010back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  \n  3. Interleaving non\u2010Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  \n\nStep 4: Pick idea 1.\n\nThis idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment has ever combined a d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network with an explicit figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. Bell\u2010measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity\u2010preservation\u2014and negativity is the signature of non\u2010classicality in phase\u2010space.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (to generate the pre\u2010shared Bell pair), number\u2010resolving detectors, post\u2010selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper\u2010entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \n\u201cInspired by the fundamental role of Wigner\u2010function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete\u2010variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear\u2010optics teleportation channel in dimension d\u2009=\u20093. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner\u2010negative test states.  \n\nExperiment sketch:  \n\u2013 Modes and parties:  \n   \u2022 Mode 0: Alice\u2019s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}).  \n   \u2022 Modes 1&2: Pre\u2010shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair\u2010source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  \n   \u2022 Modes 3\u20136: Four ancillary single photons (or pair\u2010source halves) injected at Alice\u2019s station for realizing a generalized d\u2009=\u20093 Bell\u2010state measurement by linear optics and number\u2010resolving detection.  \n   \u2022 Mode 7\u20138: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair\u2010sources for ancilla.  \n\n\u2013 Network architecture:  \n   1. At Alice: a linear\u2010optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3\u20136).  \n   2. Number\u2010resolving detectors on modes 3\u20136 post\u2010select one of the nine generalized Bell\u2010states. No active feed\u2010forward; we succeed only when a permitted click\u2010pattern occurs.  \n   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  \n\n\u2013 Constraints:  \n   \u2022 removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 \u2192 mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice\u2019s Bell measurement.  \n   \u2022 single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  \n   \u2022 anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  \n\n\u2013 Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner\u2010negative qutrit states, e.g.  \n   \u03a8\u2081 = (|0\u27e9 + |2\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9)/\u221a3,  \u03a8\u2082 = (|0\u27e9 + e^{2\u03c0i/3}|1\u27e9 + e^{\u22122\u03c0i/3}|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.  \nPytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for \u03a8\u2081 and \u03a8\u2082, which directly tests negativity\u2010preservation.  \n\nWhy this is exciting:  \n  \u2013 It bridges teleportation\u2014a paradigmatic quantum network primitive\u2014with the modern resource theory of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \n  \u2013 The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi\u2010hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  \n  \u2013 Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear\u2010optics teleporters for non\u2010Gaussianity could be a stand\u2010alone PRL.  \n\nWe ask Pytheus to search for the minimal\u2010ancilla, linear\u2010optics configuration that realizes a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner\u2010negativity\u2010state fidelity.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher wants a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for preserving discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I need to propose a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network experiment\u2014no state\u2010generation targets\u2014that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \nStep 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:\n\n  1. A d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit\u2014i.e. design the Bell\u2010measurement plus post\u2010selection network so that negative \u201cphase\u2010point\u201d values survive the teleport.  \n  2. A two\u2010hop teleportation chain (Alice\u2192Charlie\u2192Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re\u2010inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of \u201cnegativity decay\u201d through successive linear\u2010optics teleportation steps.  \n  3. A network that interleaves a single\u2010mode non\u2010Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage\u2014even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement\u2010induced negativity can boost fidelity.  \n\nStep 3: Check novelty/obstacles:\n\n  1. The single\u2010hop qutrit case above is novel (no one\u2019s optimized a discrete\u2010Wigner\u2010negativity\u2013preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement\u2010swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors to implement a d\u2009=\u20093 Bell measurement and a post\u2010selected teleportation channel. It just needs \u201cin_node,\u201d \u201cout_node,\u201d \u201canc_detectors,\u201d \u201cremoved_connections,\u201d and \u201csingle_emitters\u201d or \u201cpair_sources.\u201d  \n  2. The two\u2010hop chain is more complex, effectively back\u2010to\u2010back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  \n  3. Interleaving non\u2010Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  \n\nStep 4: Pick idea 1.\n\nThis idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment has ever combined a d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network with an explicit figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. Bell\u2010measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity\u2010preservation\u2014and negativity is the signature of non\u2010classicality in phase\u2010space.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (to generate the pre\u2010shared Bell pair), number\u2010resolving detectors, post\u2010selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper\u2010entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \n\u201cInspired by the fundamental role of Wigner\u2010function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete\u2010variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear\u2010optics teleportation channel in dimension d\u2009=\u20093. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner\u2010negative test states.  \n\nExperiment sketch:  \n\u2013 Modes and parties:  \n   \u2022 Mode 0: Alice\u2019s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}).  \n   \u2022 Modes 1&2: Pre\u2010shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair\u2010source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  \n   \u2022 Modes 3\u20136: Four ancillary single photons (or pair\u2010source halves) injected at Alice\u2019s station for realizing a generalized d\u2009=\u20093 Bell\u2010state measurement by linear optics and number\u2010resolving detection.  \n   \u2022 Mode 7\u20138: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair\u2010sources for ancilla.  \n\n\u2013 Network architecture:  \n   1. At Alice: a linear\u2010optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3\u20136).  \n   2. Number\u2010resolving detectors on modes 3\u20136 post\u2010select one of the nine generalized Bell\u2010states. No active feed\u2010forward; we succeed only when a permitted click\u2010pattern occurs.  \n   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  \n\n\u2013 Constraints:  \n   \u2022 removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 \u2192 mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice\u2019s Bell measurement.  \n   \u2022 single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  \n   \u2022 anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  \n\n\u2013 Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner\u2010negative qutrit states, e.g.  \n   \u03a8\u2081 = (|0\u27e9 + |2\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9)/\u221a3,  \u03a8\u2082 = (|0\u27e9 + e^{2\u03c0i/3}|1\u27e9 + e^{\u22122\u03c0i/3}|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.  \nPytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for \u03a8\u2081 and \u03a8\u2082, which directly tests negativity\u2010preservation.  \n\nWhy this is exciting:  \n  \u2013 It bridges teleportation\u2014a paradigmatic quantum network primitive\u2014with the modern resource theory of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \n  \u2013 The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi\u2010hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  \n  \u2013 Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear\u2010optics teleporters for non\u2010Gaussianity could be a stand\u2010alone PRL.  \n\nWe ask Pytheus to search for the minimal\u2010ancilla, linear\u2010optics configuration that realizes a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner\u2010negativity\u2010state fidelity.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher wants a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for preserving discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity.

We ban any direct in\u2192out path (removed_connections [[0,2]]), we herald only on ancilla detectors (heralding_out=true) so Bob\u2019s output photon remains free.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I need to propose a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network experiment\u2014no state\u2010generation targets\u2014that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \nStep 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:\n\n  1. A d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit\u2014i.e. design the Bell\u2010measurement plus post\u2010selection network so that negative \u201cphase\u2010point\u201d values survive the teleport.  \n  2. A two\u2010hop teleportation chain (Alice\u2192Charlie\u2192Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re\u2010inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of \u201cnegativity decay\u201d through successive linear\u2010optics teleportation steps.  \n  3. A network that interleaves a single\u2010mode non\u2010Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage\u2014even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement\u2010induced negativity can boost fidelity.  \n\nStep 3: Check novelty/obstacles:\n\n  1. The single\u2010hop qutrit case above is novel (no one\u2019s optimized a discrete\u2010Wigner\u2010negativity\u2013preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement\u2010swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number\u2010resolving detectors to implement a d\u2009=\u20093 Bell measurement and a post\u2010selected teleportation channel. It just needs \u201cin_node,\u201d \u201cout_node,\u201d \u201canc_detectors,\u201d \u201cremoved_connections,\u201d and \u201csingle_emitters\u201d or \u201cpair_sources.\u201d  \n  2. The two\u2010hop chain is more complex, effectively back\u2010to\u2010back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  \n  3. Interleaving non\u2010Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  \n\nStep 4: Pick idea 1.\n\nThis idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment has ever combined a d\u2009=\u20093 teleportation network with an explicit figure\u2010of\u2010merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. Bell\u2010measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity\u2010preservation\u2014and negativity is the signature of non\u2010classicality in phase\u2010space.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (to generate the pre\u2010shared Bell pair), number\u2010resolving detectors, post\u2010selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper\u2010entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \n\u201cInspired by the fundamental role of Wigner\u2010function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete\u2010variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear\u2010optics teleportation channel in dimension d\u2009=\u20093. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner\u2010negative test states.  \n\nExperiment sketch:  \n\u2013 Modes and parties:  \n   \u2022 Mode 0: Alice\u2019s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}).  \n   \u2022 Modes 1&2: Pre\u2010shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair\u2010source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  \n   \u2022 Modes 3\u20136: Four ancillary single photons (or pair\u2010source halves) injected at Alice\u2019s station for realizing a generalized d\u2009=\u20093 Bell\u2010state measurement by linear optics and number\u2010resolving detection.  \n   \u2022 Mode 7\u20138: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair\u2010sources for ancilla.  \n\n\u2013 Network architecture:  \n   1. At Alice: a linear\u2010optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3\u20136).  \n   2. Number\u2010resolving detectors on modes 3\u20136 post\u2010select one of the nine generalized Bell\u2010states. No active feed\u2010forward; we succeed only when a permitted click\u2010pattern occurs.  \n   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  \n\n\u2013 Constraints:  \n   \u2022 removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 \u2192 mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice\u2019s Bell measurement.  \n   \u2022 single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  \n   \u2022 anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  \n\n\u2013 Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner\u2010negative qutrit states, e.g.  \n   \u03a8\u2081 = (|0\u27e9 + |2\u27e9 \u2212 |1\u27e9)/\u221a3,  \u03a8\u2082 = (|0\u27e9 + e^{2\u03c0i/3}|1\u27e9 + e^{\u22122\u03c0i/3}|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.  \nPytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for \u03a8\u2081 and \u03a8\u2082, which directly tests negativity\u2010preservation.  \n\nWhy this is exciting:  \n  \u2013 It bridges teleportation\u2014a paradigmatic quantum network primitive\u2014with the modern resource theory of Wigner\u2010function negativity.  \n  \u2013 The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi\u2010hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  \n  \u2013 Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear\u2010optics teleporters for non\u2010Gaussianity could be a stand\u2010alone PRL.  \n\nWe ask Pytheus to search for the minimal\u2010ancilla, linear\u2010optics configuration that realizes a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner\u2010negativity\u2010state fidelity.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher wants a post\u2010selected qutrit teleportation channel optimized for preserving discrete Wigner\u2010function negativity. In Pytheus this is a map from in_node 0 to out_node 2 (identity channel for d=3), using four ancilla photons at Alice\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement and post\u2010selection (anc_detectors 3\u20136). We ban any direct in\u2192out path (removed_connections [[0,2]]), we herald only on ancilla detectors (heralding_out=true) so Bob\u2019s output photon remains free. We choose loss_func='fid' to maximize teleportation fidelity (and thus negativity preservation), with target_quantum [\"00\",\"11\",\"22\"] for the identity map on a qutrit.
