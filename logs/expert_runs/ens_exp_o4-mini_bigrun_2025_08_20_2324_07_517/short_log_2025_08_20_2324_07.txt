Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The teleportation channel requires two input modes (unknown qutrit and Alice’s half of the Bell pair), four ancilla single photons for the Bell measurement, and Bob’s output mode. We ban any direct link between the unknown input and Bob’s output, herald on the ancilla detectors, and optimize for fidelity of the identity map in d=3 with target_quantum=["00","11","22"].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (1 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to mismatched string lengths in `target_quantum` versus the declared `in_nodes`/`out_nodes`. For a single-qutrit identity channel, we treat only the unknown input (mode 0) and Bob’s output (mode 2) as the transformation, with four single-photon ancillas (modes 3–6) for the Bell measurement and one SPDC pair source (num_pre=1) to supply the entangled resource. We ban any direct path 0→2, herald only on the ancilla detectors, and optimize fidelity (“fid”) with target strings of length 2 (["00","11","22"]) matching one input and one output node.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node indexing was non-contiguous. We must include Alice’s Bell‐pair half (mode 1) as an ancilla detector and count it in num_anc, ensuring the union of nodes {0,1,2,3,4,5,6} is contiguous.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Define two input nodes (0: unknown qutrit, 1: Alice’s half of Bell pair), one output node (2: Bob’s teleported qutrit), four ancilla single-photon emitters (nodes 3–6) for the Bell measurement, and one probabilistic pair source (num_pre=1) for the Bell pair. Ban any direct connection 0→2, herald on the ancilla detectors [3–6], optimize fidelity (‘fid’) for the identity map on d=3 with target_quantum=[“00”,”11”,”22”], ensure node indices are contiguous 0–6.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We simplify to an identity qutrit gate (post‐selected teleportation channel) mapping an abstract qutrit on mode 0 to mode 1, using four single‐photon ancillas at nodes 2–5 for the Bell measurement. We ban any direct link 0→1, herald only on ancilla detectors [2–5], optimize fidelity (‘fid’) on the 3-level identity (“00”/“11”/“22”), ensure contiguous nodes 0–5.
