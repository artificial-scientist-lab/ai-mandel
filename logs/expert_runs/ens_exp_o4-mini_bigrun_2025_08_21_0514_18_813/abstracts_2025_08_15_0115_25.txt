Title: Symmetry-Protected Plasmonic-Crystal Analyzer for Four-Photon GHZ₀₀±₁₁ States

Mini-Abstract: We propose a topological 2D quadrupole plasmonic lattice whose four corner-localized bound states implement a deterministic projective measurement onto the four-qubit GHZ₀₀±₁₁ basis. By feeding four single-photon qubits and two ancilla photon pairs into designated lattice modes and using number-resolving detectors for post-selection, our design achieves unambiguous GHZ₀₀±₁₁ state discrimination entirely within the Pytheus boson-sampling framework.
