SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s suggestion must be encoded directly in Pytheus syntax. The main bug is that the abstract labels “GHZ00±11” etc. aren’t valid Fock‐state strings. I will replace them by the actual strings of basis vectors—‘0000’, ‘1111’, ‘0011’, ‘1100’—and include equal amplitudes for the ± superpositions (the signs will be learned by the optimizer). All other parts (the 2×4 lattice via removed_connections, 4 ancilla photons from SPDC, 4 input photons, post‐selection) remain exactly as suggested.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections must only reference detector nodes, and our initial list included source nodes, causing the error. To satisfy Pytheus, I’ll drop removed_connections entirely and declare the detectors explicitly—computational outputs at modes 0–3 and ancilla detectors at modes 4–7. I keep the four-qubit GHZ projectors, four SPDC ancilla photons, and four single-photon inputs exactly as suggested.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections was invalid and single_emitters must be disjoint from in_nodes. For a measurement setup, we treat the four unknown qubits as in_nodes and use SPDC ancilla pairs implicitly via num_anc. We specify anc_detectors on modes 4–7, leave single_emitters empty, and remove removed_connections. The target_quantum lists the four GHZ basis strings.
