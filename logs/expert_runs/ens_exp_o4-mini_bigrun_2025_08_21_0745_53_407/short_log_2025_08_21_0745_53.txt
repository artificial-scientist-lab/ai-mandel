Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested discrete encoding needed correction: we must use dual-rail encoding for the qubit (two input modes) and dual-rail outputs at B and C (four modes), yielding 6-mode strings. We define the four target strings representing teleportation to B or C for both input basis states and equal amplitudes. We forbid any direct source-to-output paths via removed_connections and set heralding_out to true.
