}###Title:  
Floquet-Resonant Bell-State Swapping via Wavefront-Shaped Multi-Path Interferometer

Mini-abstract:  
We implement a static 6×6 linear-optical network with programmable internal beam-splitter phases to enact a single-step Floquet cycle—alternating unitary rotations and controlled dissipation into ancilla modes 4&5—thereby “shaping” the photon wavefronts in lieu of active feedback. By heralding on exactly one click in ancilla detector 4 or 5, we conditionally swap entanglement into the target modes 0 & 3, and scanning the Floquet drive angle θ and damping strength γ reveals resonant entanglement revivals (“Floquet resonances”) in the swapped Bell-state fidelity.
