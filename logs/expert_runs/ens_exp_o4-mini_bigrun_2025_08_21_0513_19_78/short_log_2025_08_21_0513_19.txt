Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration targets a passive linear-optical joint measurement mixing modes 1,2 with two single-photon ancillas (modes 4,5) to herald the concentration-swap, leaving remote modes 0 and 3 in the qubit Bell state. We set out_nodes=[0,3], heralding_out=true, num_anc=2, single_emitters at [4,5], and number_resolving detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node numbering must be contiguous from 0 to 5. I add all modes as incoming via in_nodes so that union of in_nodes, out_nodes, and single_emitters covers 0–5.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Fix node indexing by listing only the measured SPDC halves as in_nodes=[1,2], out_nodes=[0,3] for the surviving modes, and single_emitters=[4,5] for ancilla. This makes the union of all nodes 0–5 and keeps in/out disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Treat this as a state‐generation task: nodes 0–1 are the remote output (qubit Bell pair), nodes 2–5 are ancilla detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Treat the two qutrit Bell pairs and two single photons as incoming modes 0–5, heralding on modes 1,2,4,5 and leaving modes 0 & 3 as the unmeasured outputs. Set in_nodes to [0,1,2,3,4,5], out_nodes to [0,3], num_anc=4 (the four detectors on 1,2,4,5), heralding_out=true, single_emitters at [4,5], and target_qubit Bell state ["00","11"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: For a heralded concentration-swap, treat it as state generation: two remote modes (0,1) form the qubit Bell output; two SPDC ancilla photons (nodes 2,3) plus two single-photon emitters (nodes 4,5) are measured. We set num_anc=2 (SPDC ancillas), single_emitters=[4,5], no in_nodes/out_nodes, heralding_out=true, target_quantum=["00","11"], and number_resolving detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Reformulate as a state‐generation task following the ES_246 example: no explicit in/out nodes, the two-qubit Bell output is created on modes 0–1, four ancilla photons (two from SPDC resources and two single-photon emitters) on modes 2–5 are measured, heralding_out=true, and remove any connection between modes 0 and 1.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s node‐index requirements, I treat this as a state‐generation/entanglement‐swapping problem: no explicit inputs, generate the qubit Bell pair on modes 0–1, use two qutrit‐Bell‐pair SPDC sources implicitly plus two single‐photon ancillas (num_anc=4 total ancilla photons, two from SPDC and two from SPS), and herald on all ancilla detectors, leaving modes 0–1 in |00>+|11>. This mirrors ES_246 but for qubit Bell output, so nodes are implicit, no in/out, single_emitters = [2,3], num_anc=4, removed_connections to enforce no common source to output modes [0,1].
