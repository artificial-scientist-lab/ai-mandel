Title: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair

Abstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.
