Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will run Pytheus on the cleaned-up JSON configuration for the heralded cyclic-shift router on a path-encoded qutrit, enabling complex amplitudes and using two ancilla photons for heralding.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Target state had invalid format and could not be created.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates an invalid target format, likely due to inline comments and unsupported imaginary flag. I'll clean up the JSON—remove comments, set imaginary to false, include num_pre, and omit anc_detectors—so Pytheus can parse the 6‐mode cyclic‐shift qutrit router.
