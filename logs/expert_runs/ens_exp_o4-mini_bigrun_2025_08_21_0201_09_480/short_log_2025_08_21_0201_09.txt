Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration faithfully targets the fusion of two 3-level Bell pairs into one 2-level Bell pair via a single joint heralded linear-optical measurement, using two single-photon ancillas and number-resolving detectors. The parameters reflect the suggested mode numbering and resources without altering the intended target.

Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because we listed ancilla emitter nodes without specifying the full set of input/output nodes, violating the requirement that the union of all node labels must be {0,…,N−1}. We'll remedy this by declaring all six modes (two qutrit pairs and two ancillas) as incoming, and explicitly marking the two remote modes as outputs, so that the union of in_nodes, out_nodes, and single_emitters covers {0,1,2,3,4,5}.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to declare only the two central resource modes and the two ancilla emitters as inputs, mark the two remote modes as outputs, and set heralding so that only those inputs are measured. This covers nodes 0–5 without overlap and matches the target of producing a qubit Bell pair on modes 0 and 3.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now declares all four system modes as incoming, sets the remote modes 0 and 3 as outputs (undetected), uses two single-photon emitters for ancillas at modes 4 and 5, and detects modes 1,2,4,5. The union of node labels is contiguous from 0 to 5, and removed_connections enforces nonlocality between A (0) and D (3).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the abstract target: two qutrit Bell pairs become one qubit Bell pair via a single joint heralded measurement. We use two single-photon ancillas at modes 4 and 5, number-resolving detectors, and no input/output modes need explicit declaration—Pytheus will infer the abstract resources from the target state.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We've followed the entanglement‐swapping example pattern—no explicit in_nodes or out_nodes—declaring two single‐photon ancilla emitters at modes 4 and 5, forbidding common SPDC sources between A–C and B–D, and targeting the unnormalized qubit Bell state on the unmeasured remote modes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To comply with Pytheus’s conventions for state‐generation setups, I omit explicit in_nodes/out_nodes, use num_anc=2 SPDC ancillas, and forbid any SPDC source connecting the two remote modes (0 and 3) via removed_connections. This matches the abstract target of concentrating two qutrit Bell pairs into one qubit Bell pair via a single joint measurement.
