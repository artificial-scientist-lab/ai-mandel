}###Title: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P₁₋ex for Three Photonic Qubits

Abstract: We implement a heralded global P₁₋ex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits—mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)—that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit σₓ rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = Ω∑_iσₓ^i + V∑_{⟨i,j⟩}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.
