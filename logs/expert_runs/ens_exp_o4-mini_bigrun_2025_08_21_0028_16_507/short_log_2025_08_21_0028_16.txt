Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The cyclic-SWAP ring-exchange can be encoded as a 3-qubit unitary mapping |a,b,c>→|b,c,a| with 3 single-photon inputs, 6 ancillary photons from SPDC pairs, heralded Bell measurements, and forbidden direct pair-source links between inputs. I'll submit the corresponding Pytheus configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint. The three inputs are loaded via in_nodes, so we should not list them as single_emitters. I will remove single_emitters and retry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Fixed the removed_connections to reference only output detector nodes (no overlap with inputs) and removed single_emitters to satisfy disjoint constraints.
