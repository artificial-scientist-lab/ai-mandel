Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s target is a fixed pure Choi state over four modes [R,C,D,E] with six fock basis terms. We treat this as pure-state generation with probabilistic ancilla photons (num_anc=6) and enforce nonlocality by removed_connections between R and each of C,D,E. We choose a fidelity loss in the fock basis.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought:
The error arose because I used loss_func='fockfid' with string-based target_quantum. For discrete-variable target states I should use 'fid'. Also, in state-preparation tasks no in_nodes/out_nodes are needed—out_nodes defaults to all modes. I’ll switch to loss_func="fid", remove in_nodes/out_nodes, and keep heralding_out=true so only ancilla detectors click while leaving the four target modes undetected.
