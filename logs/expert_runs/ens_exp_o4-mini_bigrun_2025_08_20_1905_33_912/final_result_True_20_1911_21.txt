}###Title:  
Direct Single-Shot Measurement of the Second Rényi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  

Abstract:  
We propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second Rényi out-of-time-ordered correlator O₂(t)=⟨W₁(t)V₄W₁(t)V₄⟩ on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each “atom” qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4×4 interferometer implements U(t) and U†(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.
