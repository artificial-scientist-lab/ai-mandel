Title  
Photonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding

Mini-abstract  
We present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional “Qudit Butterfly” protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ from senders Alice₁ (node A) and Alice₂ (node B) to receivers R₁ and R₂ over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d > 2.
