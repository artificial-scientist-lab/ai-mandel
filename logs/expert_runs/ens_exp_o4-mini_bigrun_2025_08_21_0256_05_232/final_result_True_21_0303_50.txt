Ancilla‐Controlled Multi‐Mode SWAP Supermap for Unified Global and Pixel‐Resolved Fidelity Imaging of 4-Mode Spatial Qudits

Mini-abstract:  
We implement a genuine multi-mode ancilla-controlled-SWAP supermap in a static linear-optics network that coherently swaps each of four mode pairs between two unknown 4-mode spatial qudit target states ρ_A and ρ_B under an ancilla in equal superposition. By measuring the ancilla in the Fourier basis we directly obtain the global overlap Tr[ρ_A ρ_B], while routing its computational-basis outcomes to number-resolving detectors yields per-mode fidelities F_i=Tr[ρ_{A,i} ρ_{B,i}], achieving one-shot quantum imaging and state fidelity estimation in a single experiment.
