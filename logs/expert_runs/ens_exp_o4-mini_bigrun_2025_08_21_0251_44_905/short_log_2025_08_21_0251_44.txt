Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for a closed-loop four-step teleportation around an SSH ring is now specified, including ancilla Bell measurements (anc_detectors), ring connectivity constraints (removed_connections), input/output nodes, and target mapping for a single-photon teleportation (modes 0→1). I will invoke Pytheus with this config.
