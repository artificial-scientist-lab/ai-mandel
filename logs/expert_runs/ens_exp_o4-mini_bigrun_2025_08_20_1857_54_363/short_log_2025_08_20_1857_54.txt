Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target_quantum strings need to reflect the cyclic‐SWAP mapping on a 9‐mode, single‐rail encoding with 3 inputs and 6 ancilla modes. I’ve constructed the eight basis mappings so that the initial photons in modes [0,1,2] are teleported to [4,6,8] in the order (b,c,a), with all other modes zero after heralding. I’ll now call pytheus with that configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (9) does not match number of in/out nodes (3 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target_quantum strings must list only in_nodes and out_nodes, ignoring ancilla modes, so each string should be 6 digits long. I will correct target_quantum to reflect the cyclic shift mapping |a,b,c>→|b,c,a| across in_nodes [0,1,2] and out_nodes [6,7,8], and update out_nodes accordingly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous errors arose from incorrect mode indexing and mixing single_emitters with in_nodes. I’ll switch to SPDC ancilla, set out_nodes [3,4,5], remove single_emitters, and list the eight 6-digit basis mappings for |a,b,c>→|b,c,a>.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections constraint is only supported for detectors, not input nodes, and for gates it’s optional. I will omit it and set out_nodes to [3,4,5] matching the six‐digit target strings.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will define a purely SPDC‐based heralded three‐qubit gate with 3 in_nodes [0,1,2], 3 out_nodes [3,4,5], and 6 ancilla photons from pair sources to implement the cyclic permutation |a,b,c>→|b,c,a|. I list all 8 basis mappings as 6‐digit strings, set heralding_out=true, omit removed_connections, and request number-resolving detectors.
