SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion calls for a heralded, non‐unitary PT‐symmetric filter embedded in a teleportation‐based remote CNOT. To implement exactly that—using only SPDC pair sources (no single emitters), two extra SPDC ancilla sources for the PT filter yielding 4 ancilla photons, forbidding direct resource SPDC paths between A and C and between B and the other side—I will set up a two‐qubit gate transform mapping |00>,|01>,|10>,|11>→|00>,|01>,|11>,|10>, with 4 ancilla photons, deleted connections [[0,3],[1,2]], number‐resolving detectors, and heralding on all ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true). This stays true to the researcher’s target.
