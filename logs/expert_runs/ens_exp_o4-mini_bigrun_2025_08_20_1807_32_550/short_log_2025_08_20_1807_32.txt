Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Preparing the JSON config for the 4-party GHZ entanglement-swapping star with heralded projection and network-steering test, using four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a 4-photon GHZ projector with four ancilla detectors, and removed_connections to enforce correct wiring.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because removed_connections targeted central modes (4–7) which are not output vertices, effectively forbidding nothing, while also specifying in_nodes/out_nodes unnecessarily. I'll simplify the config to match the pattern for state creation tasks: leave in_nodes and out_nodes empty (so remote modes 0–3 are outputs by default), remove anc_detectors and single_emitters, and restrict only the remote output pairs in removed_connections. This preserves the GHZ‐swapping star target and non-locality constraints.
