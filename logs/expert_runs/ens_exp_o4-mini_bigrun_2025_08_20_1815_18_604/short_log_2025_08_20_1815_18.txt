Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I'll run Pytheus on the simplified heralded three‐party GHZ entanglement‐swapping primitive with two ancillas, mapping B’s 3 modes onto the remote GHZ nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that the required key “tries_per_edge” was missing. I’ll add a default value for it and include an empty “removed_connections” list to finalize the configuration.
