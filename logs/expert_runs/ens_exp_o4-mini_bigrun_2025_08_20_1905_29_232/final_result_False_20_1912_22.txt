Heralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1→2 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning

Mini-abstract:  
We propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1→2 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |ψ⟩, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry—and hence the fidelities of the two output clones—is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift φ.
