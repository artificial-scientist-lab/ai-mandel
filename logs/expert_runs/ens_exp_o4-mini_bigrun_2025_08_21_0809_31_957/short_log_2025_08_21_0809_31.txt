Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects the heralded cyclic‐SWAP (ring‐exchange) unitary by teleporting three input qubits through three SPDC pair sources with Bell measurements, forbidding any direct source between input modes, using six ancilla photons, and heralding on ancilla detectors so that outputs emerge in cyclic order. The target_quantum encodes all eight basis mappings |a,b,c>→|b,c,a>, in_nodes [0,1,2], out_nodes [4,6,8], removed_connections [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], heralding_out=true, and number_resolving detectors. This stays within Pytheus’s abstract framework without feedback.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises from overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters. The input qubits are provided via in_nodes, so we should remove single_emitters. We'll set single_emitters to an empty list and retry the configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because the union of in_nodes and out_nodes must cover nodes 0–8 contiguously. We add anc_detectors=[3,5,7] so that nodes 0–8 are all used exactly once.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes must cover nodes 0–N contiguously, and ancilla SPDC modes are implicit. I will set out_nodes to [3,4,5], keep target_quantum as 6-digit strings, drop anc_detectors and single_emitters. This makes in_nodes ∪ out_nodes = {0,1,2,3,4,5}, contiguous.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration must cover nodes 0–5 contiguously. I remove removed_connections to satisfy Pytheus’s requirements, set in_nodes to [0,1,2], out_nodes to [3,4,5], num_anc=6, heralding_out=true, and leave single_emitters empty. This should run without errors.
