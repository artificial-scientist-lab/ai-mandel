}###Title: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3

Abstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (Ψ₁,Ψ₂), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.
