Title:
Measurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network

Mini-Abstract:
We propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3×3 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z₂ toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon “data qubit” and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0⟩→|+⟩, |1⟩→|–⟩) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.
