Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The telecloning channel is a postselected transformation consuming the dual‐rail input qubit on modes [0,1] and heralding on two memory detectors [4,5], leaving two approximate clones on B (mode 2) and C (mode 3). We express the perfect mapping for the two logical basis states: vacuum→vacuum clones and single‐photon→two‐photon clones, then use a fidelity loss function to maximize average cloning fidelity under a minimum success probability.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The only error reported was that our target_quantum strings (length 6) didn’t match the declared in_nodes+out_nodes (2+2=4).  In Pytheus every target string must span exactly in_nodes+out_nodes modes; ancilla detectors are handled implicitly via num_anc and heralding_out, not via target_quantum.  We must shrink all target strings to length 4.  We will keep the ideal cloning‐basis mapping: logical |0⟩ (dual‐rail “10”) → two vacuum clones (“0000” can’t work), and logical |1⟩ (“01”) → two single‐photon clones (“1111”).  Since perfect quantum cloning is impossible, the optimizer will approximate and maximize average fidelity with loss_func “fid” against these two basis mappings under the success constraint.  That preserves the telecloning target exactly (|0⟩→|00⟩, |1⟩→|11⟩) in the basis.

Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because single_emitters overlapped with in_nodes and the target length mismatched in_nodes+out_nodes. We need two output qubits (two clones) encoded in dual rails ([2,3] and [4,5]), two ancilla photons from single_emitters at [6,7], heralded to post-select successful runs. The target mapping is |10>→|10,10> (“101010”) and |01>→|01,01> (“010101”).
