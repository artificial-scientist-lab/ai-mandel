Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher's SSH‐corner teleportation proposal and incorporates the suggested modifications—two SPDC ancilla sources, Bell measurements at interior nodes, heralding, forbidden SSH nonedges, and target Bell pair on corner modes [0,3].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the number of modes implied by target_quantum (length of strings) didn’t match the node indices. I’ve corrected this by using dual-rail encoding over four modes (0–3) and specifying the Bell state ["0101","1010"] across all output nodes [0,1,2,3]. All node indices are now contiguous and valid.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stems from Pytheus requiring that the union of in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes be contiguous starting at zero. We will add all four detector nodes (0–3) to in_nodes without altering the target or the SSH‐teleportation intent. This satisfies the contiguity constraint while keeping the proposed protocol unchanged.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Bell‐state generation on four modes with two ancillas, heralded via ancilla clicks, and forbidden SSH diagonals works if we specify a 2-photon Fock target over modes 0–3 and omit explicit in/out nodes. This satisfies contiguity and captures the teleportation-entanglement swapping structure.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The teleportation protocol reduces to heralded Bell‐pair generation between corners 0 and 3 under SSH adjacency constraints. We encode the Bell qubit in dual‐rail over modes 0–3 (strings “1010” and “0101”), use two ancilla photons (SPDC) measured in the two interior Bell detections, and enforce SSH nonedges. No explicit in/out nodes—heralding_out preserves the two output photons.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The SSH-inspired teleportation reduces to heralded entanglement swapping producing a Bell pair on the two opposite corners (modes 0 and 3) in dual-rail over four modes. We use four SPDC ancillas (one on each of the four edges of the square) so that each interior junction has two photons for a Bell measurement, enforce the SSH adjacency by forbidding the four diagonal/boundary nonedges, and herald the ancilla clicks. We choose discrete-variable kets ["1010","0101"] across modes [0–3], no explicit out_nodes (all are outgoing), and supply in_nodes [0,1,2,3] to satisfy contiguity.

Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Define the Bell-pair target on four contiguous detector modes 0–3 as dual-rail kets ["0101","1010"], use two SPDC ancillas with heralded interior measurements, and enforce the SSH nonedges; leave in_nodes empty and set out_nodes=[0,1,2,3] to satisfy contiguity.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The SSH‐corner teleportation is a heralded Fock‐state transfer from corner mode 0 to mode 3 under SSH adjacency constraints. We encode the qubit in Fock across four corner modes plus two ancilla modes, use two SPDC ancillas (num_anc=2), herald interior measurements, enforce forbidden nonedges, and specify target kets of length 6: one photon in mode 0 or mode 3.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0)), ((3, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0))]. There are 1 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [((6, 0), (7, 0))] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s contiguity requirements while remaining true to the researcher’s SSH‐corner teleportation, I relabel the two corner output modes to 0 and 1 and the two interior Bell‐measurement modes to 2 and 3.  We forbid all non‐SSH adjacency by removing connections [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]], use two SPDC ancilla photons (num_anc=2) at the interior nodes (in_nodes=[2,3]), herald those clicks to post‐select the Bell outcome, and target the Bell pair |00>+|11> on the corner outputs (out_nodes=[0,1]).
