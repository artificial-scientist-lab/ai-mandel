Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will configure a PyTheus search for the four‐node mixed‐source entanglement‐swapping network, with two SPDC pairs (A–B and C–D), a single‐photon‐emitter Bell link (B–C), and adjustable ancilla resources to tune an effective linewidth. I forbid any SPDC pair directly linking detectors outside {0,1} or {2,3} via removed_connections, include two single_emitters for the B–C link, and set num_anc ≥ 4, targeting the Bell state |00>+|11> on detectors A (0) and D (3), with heralded detection.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates node labels must form a contiguous set starting at 0 when single_emitters are used. I’ll include out_nodes=[0,1] so 0,1,2,3 cover all nodes (0–1 outputs, 2–3 single‐photon emitters), set num_anc=4 to have four ancilla detectors, forbid SPDC cross‐links between A/D and B/C via removed_connections, and run the mixed‐source entanglement‐swapping configuration.
