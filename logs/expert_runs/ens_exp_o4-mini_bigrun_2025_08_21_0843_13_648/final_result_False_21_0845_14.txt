Mini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A–B and C–D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B–C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.
