Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration has been adapted to a single-state analyzer for the |Φ⁺⟩ Bell state using an anti-PT SSH loop, with two SPDC ancilla sources and six threshold detectors. The `target_quantum` and `amplitudes` faithfully represent |00⟩+|11⟩, `imaginary:true` enables non-Hermitian couplings, and the forbidden trivial bypasses are enforced via `removed_connections`.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Introduce a valid input `imaginary`.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because `imaginary` must be a string specifying the complex format rather than a boolean. Additionally, two SPDC sources yield four ancilla photons (`num_anc = 4`). I’ve corrected `imaginary` to "cartesian" and adjusted `num_anc`. The rest stays faithful to the Φ⁺-analyzer design.
