Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The sketch provided requires custom SPDC amplitudes for the two weak links and forbidding any direct source between the final remote modes; we must encode the two nonmax entangled input pairs, the static LO on inner modes [1,2], heralding on detectors [4,5], and target a perfect Bell on remote modes [0,3]. Below is the complete Pytheus JSON config exactly matching that description (λ to be specified by the user).

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped—state generation doesn't need explicit in/out nodes. I'll remove those fields and match the ES_246 pattern, specifying two ancilla detectors via num_anc and removed_connections, targeting ['00','11'].
