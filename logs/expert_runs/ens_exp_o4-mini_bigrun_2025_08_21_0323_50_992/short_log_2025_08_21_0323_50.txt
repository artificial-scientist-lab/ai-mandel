Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need a Pytheus configuration that implements a Bell‐state projection between two time‐evolved modes (the entanglement swap) – i.e. projecting onto the |Φ+⟩=(|00⟩+|11⟩) state – as the topological‐order measurement. We'll set up a post‐selected Bell analyzer (no additional ancilla photons) with two inputs and two outputs, targeting the two‐ket terms "0000" and "1111" with equal amplitudes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Bell‐state projection measurement requires two input photons and two detectors. To isolate the |Φ+⟩ components (|00⟩+|11⟩), we set up a post‐selected measurement with no outgoing modes, two detectors, and target_quantum ["00","11"] with equal amplitudes. We'll ask Pytheus to find a linear‐optical network realizing this conditional Bell analyzer.
