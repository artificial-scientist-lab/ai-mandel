}###Title: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band

Mini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N–k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.
