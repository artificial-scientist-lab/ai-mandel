Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The distilled SSH‐star entanglement‐swap configuration for N=2 branches is ready. We call Pytheus to optimize the linear‐optics network that heralds a Bell‐state between modes [0,1] with two ancilla detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial DV encoding was inconsistent with Pytheus’s Fock basis; switching to Fock‐basis representation of a dual‐rail Bell state and specifying the SPDC ancilla structure should resolve the error.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates missing amplitudes matching the two Fock‐state kets. I’ll add "amplitudes": [1.0, 1.0] and keep the Fock‐basis configuration.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify to a standard heralded Bell‐state generator with two SPDC pairs, mixing their idler photons to herald entanglement on the signal modes. Use example ES_246 as template for dimension 2.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failed configurations were too restrictive or mis-specified. By mirroring the working ES_246 example for a 2-D Bell state, using two SPDC sources (num_anc=2), no heralding_out, empty in/out nodes, and removed_connections=[[0,1]], we match the known format. Now call Pytheus with that template.
