Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The bilocality protocol can be cast as a four‐photon measurement scheme: two independent Bell‐pair sources feed four input modes (nodes 0–3), a static linear network at B uses four ancilla detectors (nodes 4–7) to herald one joint outcome, and the two remaining clicks at A (node 0) and C (node 3) correlate in a Bell pattern. We target only the four correlated 4‐bit patterns (“0000”, “0011”, “1100”, “1111”) out of the sixteen possibilities, with six detectors (two at A and C plus four at B). We ask Pytheus to optimize this post‐selected measurement (no out_nodes) with num_anc = 6.
