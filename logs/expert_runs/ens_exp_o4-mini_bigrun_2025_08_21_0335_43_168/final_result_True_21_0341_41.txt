Abstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes √α, √β, √γ across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve. By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights α, β, γ set in situ via atomic lattice depths—enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.
