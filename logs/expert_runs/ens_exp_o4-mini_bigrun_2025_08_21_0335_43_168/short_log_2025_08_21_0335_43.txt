SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will translate the suggestion into a pytheus configuration for generating the Choi pure state of a programmable three-destination teleportation supermap. I'll keep the six basis terms and equal amplitudes (√1/3 each) as a proof-of-principle, include three ancillas, remove direct source connections from reference to each output, set heralded detection, and use a fidelity loss.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target kets had varying photon numbers, making perfect matchings impossible. To fix this, I'll express the Choi target in dual-rail encoding across 8 modes (reference + three dual-rail output qubits), so each ket has exactly four photons. I'll update target_quantum and amplitudes accordingly and adjust num_anc to include the eight ancilla photons from the Bell sources.
