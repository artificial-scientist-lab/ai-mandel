}###Title: Robust Photonic Qubit Teleportation via Topologically Protected Edge-State Entanglement in an SSH Ladder

Mini-abstract: We propose and implement teleportation of a photonic qubit from mode 0 to mode 7 across a two-leg Su–Schrieffer–Heeger ladder by generating and post-selecting a Bell-state between the topologically protected edge modes (0 and 7). Using only linear optics—probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla-mediated Bell measurements on weak bonds, and removal of unwanted connections—we target the entanglement of end modes 0 & 7 to achieve disorder-resilient qubit transfer via multi-path interference.
