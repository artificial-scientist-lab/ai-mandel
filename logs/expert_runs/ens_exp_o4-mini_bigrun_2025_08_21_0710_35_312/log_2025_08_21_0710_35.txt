    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201cMajorana mode\u201d and \u201ccontinuous quantum phase transition\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible network (avoid pure state generation).\n  1. Teleportation\u2010based Majorana braiding: use entanglement swapping and Bell\u2010measurements to enact the non\u2010Abelian exchange gate (U=exp(\u03c0/4\u2009\u03b3_i\u03b3_j)) on a logical qubit, simulating Majorana swap via teleportation.  \n  2. Percolation in a 2D entanglement lattice as an analog of a Kitaev chain\u2019s topological transition: build a small lattice of Bell pairs and swapping nodes; tune link success probability and observe a percolation threshold\u2014continuous transition\u2014from disconnected to a large entangled cluster.  \n  3. Linear\u2010optical simulation of a 1D Kitaev chain: arrange N probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources in a chain, perform entanglement swapping at each intermediate node; by tuning the beam\u2010splitter reflectivities in the Bell\u2010measurement modules one sweeps through the chain\u2019s \u201ccoupling strength.\u201d  End\u2010to\u2010end entanglement appears only above a critical reflectivity, mimicking the topological phase transition and emergence of Majorana zero\u2010mode correlations at the ends.\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty and Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. Braiding via teleportation: novel, but Pytheus struggles to optimize arbitrary unitaries\u2014more like state gating than network percolation.  \n  2. 2D percolation lattice: interesting but doesn\u2019t directly link to Majorana zero modes or a continuous quantum phase transition in a topological model.  \n  3. Kitaev\u2010chain emulation via entanglement\u2013swapping chain: novel (no previous chain\u2010percolation experiments in list), maps directly to Majorana physics, focuses on network entanglement swapping, uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, detectors\u2014fully in Pytheus scope.\n\nStep 3: Pick idea 3 as it's both novel (no one has done a discrete\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swap threshold) and feasible in Pytheus.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns a standard entanglement\u2010swapping chain into an optical analog of the Kitaev 1D topological superconductor.  One observes a continuous \u201ctopological\u201d phase transition in which end-to-end entanglement (the analog of Majorana zero modes) only emerges above a critical bond strength.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n  \u2022 Probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources arranged in a linear chain  \n  \u2022 Intermediate Bell\u2013state measurements via beam splitters and photon detectors  \n  \u2022 A single continuous tuning parameter (beam\u2010splitter reflectivity) that Pytheus can treat as a fixed design parameter per run  \n  \u2022 No cavities, no feedback, no hyper\u2013entanglement, just linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post\u2010selection\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to use Pytheus to design an entanglement\u2010swapping chain that simulates the topological phase transition of the Kitaev 1D Majorana chain via a continuous tuning of Bell\u2010measurement strength.  Sketch of the target network:\n\n  \u2022 Nodes: label the end sites A and Z, and intermediate sites B\u2081, B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}.  \n  \u2022 Photon\u2010pair sources: place probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources on each nearest\u2010neighbor link (A\u2212B\u2081, B\u2081\u2212B\u2082, \u2026, B_{N\u22121}\u2212Z).  \n  \u2022 Swapping modules: at each intermediate node B_i, perform a linear\u2010optical Bell\u2010measurement (two incoming photons \u2192 beam splitter with reflectivity r, two photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors).  \n  \u2022 Continuous parameter: reflectivity r of every BSM beam splitter;  when r is below r_c the swapping fails to establish long\u2010range entanglement, when r>r_c a finite probability yields entanglement between A and Z\u2014a continuous quantum phase transition in the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement E(r).  \n  \u2022 Heralding: successful entanglement on each link is post\u2010selected by the local detectors; end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement is verified by measuring A and Z in complementary bases.  \n\nThis setup can be encoded in Pytheus as:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 0 (we only have pair sources)  \n  \u2022 num_anc = 2(N\u22121) ancilla detectors at the B_i stations  \n  \u2022 target_quantum: no specific multi-photon state; instead we ask Pytheus to maximize the concurrence between detection modes A and Z conditioned on all ancilla clicks  \n  \u2022 removed_connections: forbid any direct source connecting A\u2194Z or skipping nodes  \n  \u2022 varying reflectivity r by running several optimizations  \n\nGeneralisations:\n  \u2013 Change chain length N to study finite-size scaling of the critical point  \n  \u2013 Extend to Y-junctions or 2D lattices to simulate Majorana network percolation  \n  \u2013 Implement \u201cbraiding\u201d by dynamically reconfiguring which BSMs are active  \n\nThis experiment opens a path to emulate Majorana topological physics and continuous quantum phase transitions using linear\u2010optical quantum networks and entanglement swapping\u2014and is well within Pytheus\u2019s design capabilities.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The researcher\u2019s suggestion is to build a minimal N=2 entanglement\u2010swapping chain that heralds a Bell (NOON) state |1,0>+|0,1> between the two end modes A and C.

This uses two SPDC pair sources (num_pre=2), heralded Bell\u2010measurement on the middle two photons (num_anc=2 and heralding_out=true), targets the Fock\u2010basis Bell state [[1,0],[0,1]] across the two end modes, and forbids any SPDC directly linking the ends (removed_connections=[[0,1]]). I\u2019ll optimize fidelity of the produced state.\n\nAction: pytheus  \nAction Input: {\n  \"description\": \"Heralded two\u2010link entanglement\u2010swapping chain simulating Kitaev\u2010chain end\u2010to\u2010end Bell state |10>+|01>\",\n  \"foldername\": \"kitaev_chain_N2\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 30,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"fockfid\",\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 50,\n  \"num_pre\": 2,\n  \"num_anc\": 2,\n  \"target_quantum\": [[1, 0], [0, 1]],\n  \"amplitudes\": [1.0, 1.0],\n  \"imaginary\": false,\n  \"thresholds\": [0.1, 0.01],\n  \"heralding_out\": true,\n  \"removed_connections\": [[0, 1]],\n  \"tries_per_edge\": 10,\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nPytheus error: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: \nError Type: Exception\nError Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup.

There are 1 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [((2, 0), (3, 0))] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.\nThis error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function.
