Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Accept the suggested static‐network encoding of the indefinite‐order purification as a three‐photon GHZ‐type output (|0⟩_P|00⟩_AD + |1⟩_P|11⟩_AD), with a single‐photon emitter and four SPDC inputs, mapping five in_nodes to three out_nodes and postselecting on the two target patterns.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because node 0 was both in in_nodes and single_emitters. The path‐qubit emitter should be listed only in single_emitters, so remove 0 from in_nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (3 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target strings are 8 bits, so total nodes must be 8. Pytheus counts only in_nodes+out_nodes+ancilla as nodes, and single_emitters are not added. To match 8 nodes, include the path‐qubit emitter as an in_node and drop single_emitters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Consolidate all photons (path qubit and four noisy‐EPR inputs) as in_nodes, no single_emitters, and use 4 ancilla detectors with heralding_out true. Ensure 5 in + 3 out = 8 total modes matching target_quantum length. Forbid any direct A→D or C→B links via removed_connections.
