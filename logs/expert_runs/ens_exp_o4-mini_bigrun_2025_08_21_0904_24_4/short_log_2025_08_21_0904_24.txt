Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now aligns with Pytheus requirements: it uses single-photon emitters for all seven inputs, defines two ancilla photons, heralded detection of ancillas only, and targets the Bell subspace across modes 0 and 4 with no direct common source. Time to run the search.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The overlap error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint. For state generation with heralded ancilla detection, it’s better to omit both fields so Pytheus defaults to treating all target photons as outgoing. I’ll remove them and rerun.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The overlap errors stem from incorrectly labeling all emitters as single_emitters. I’ll declare only the ancilla modes as single_emitters, set all photons (including ancilla) as inputs via in_nodes, and explicitly mark the two end modes as outputs. This ensures no overlap between out_nodes and single_emitters.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus treats SPDC sources by default for ancilla photons and only uses removed_connections to enforce no common source between the two output modes. Following the ES_246 template, I’ll drop explicit in_nodes/out_nodes and single_emitters so that Pytheus generates a heralded Bell state across modes 0 and 1, with two ancilla detectors and no common source.
