Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s telecloning channel can be cast as a transformation from a dual-rail input qubit (modes 0,1) to two dual-rail output qubits (modes 2,3 and 4,5). We ask Pytheus to approximate the ideal mapping |10⟩→|10,10⟩ and |01⟩→|01,01⟩ with heralded ancilla detection on two SPDC-created photons, maximizing the average fidelity. We keep the target mapping exactly as proposed, include two ancilla photons, dual-rail output mode specification, number-resolving detectors, and heralding.
