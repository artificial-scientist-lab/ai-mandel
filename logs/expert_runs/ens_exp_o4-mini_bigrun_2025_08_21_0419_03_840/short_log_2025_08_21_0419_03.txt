Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The original suggested JSON used symbolic parameters and mixed up mapping of input/output nodes. I’ve assigned concrete numeric values α=0.5 and r=0.6 so that K=α·r=0.3, cleaned up the in/out nodes (inputs: A(0),B(1),C(2),D(3),R1(4),R2(5); outputs: A(0),D(3),R1(4),R2(5)), declared B(1) and C(2) as heralded detectors, and removed the symbolic amplitudes. This config now correctly encodes the catalytic transformation with a squeezed ancilla reservoir.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. For a heralded state‐generation task, we remove both in_nodes and out_nodes (treat all photons as ancilla from SPDC) and specify ancilla detectors for modes 1 and 2. This matches examples like 2pES_3d.
