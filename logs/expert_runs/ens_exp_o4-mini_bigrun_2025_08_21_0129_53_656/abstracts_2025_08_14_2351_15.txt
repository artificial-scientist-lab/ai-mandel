Title:
Reusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation

Mini-abstract:
We demonstrate a linear-optical “catalytic” entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X′–Y′ catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A–B) and [6,7] (X′–Y′), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.
