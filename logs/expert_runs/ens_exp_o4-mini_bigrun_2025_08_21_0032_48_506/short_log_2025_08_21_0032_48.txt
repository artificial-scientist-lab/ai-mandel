Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s proposed configuration uses invalid node indices and mismatched target strings. I will recast it as a post-selected, heralded identity mapping on a dual-rail qubit (two modes → two modes) conditioned on a Bell measurement of two ancillas. We use two single-photon emitters for the input rails, two SPDC ancilla photons, and heralding clicks on ancilla detectors at modes 4 & 5. The target_quantum is the identity on two qubits.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error occurred because in_nodes and single_emitters overlapped. Input photons are external (in_nodes), so we remove single_emitters and use SPDC for the two ancilla photons (num_anc=2) detected at modes 4 and 5.
