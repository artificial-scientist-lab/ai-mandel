}###Title:  
Photonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models

Mini-abstract:  
We propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S₍i,j₎ of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell–fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network’s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-Rényi entanglement negativity ∝|S₍i,j₎|², providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.
