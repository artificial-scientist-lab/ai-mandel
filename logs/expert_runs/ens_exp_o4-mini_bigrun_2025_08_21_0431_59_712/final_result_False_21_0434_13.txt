Programmable LOQC “Multi-Task Analyzer” Discovered via Quantum Machine Learning  

Mini-Abstract:  
We demonstrate a programmable LOQC “Multi-Task Analyzer” discovered via quantum machine learning that uses ancilla photons as software-defined program bits to toggle between a full two-qubit Bell measurement and a three-qubit GHZ measurement in one static optical network.  Tuned by Pythesus’s classical optimizer, this device requires no dynamic feedback—only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors—to realize two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks on demand.
