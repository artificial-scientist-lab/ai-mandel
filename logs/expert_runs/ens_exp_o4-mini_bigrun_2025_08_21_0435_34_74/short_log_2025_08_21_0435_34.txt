This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because we left target_quantum empty and had no explicit out_nodes, so Pytheus indexed beyond the list. We must supply at least two Fock‐state patterns (one for “+” and one for “–”) and list all 10 detection modes so the optimizer knows where photons go. Here I insert placeholder patterns for the two projectors and set out_nodes to [0–9]. Action: pytheus

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The overlap between in_nodes and out_nodes was causing the disjointness error, and the target_quantum entries must match the length of out_nodes. I've removed the control photon (mode 9) from out_nodes and added it as a single_emitter, provided two placeholder 6-mode Fock patterns for '+' and '–' projectors, and ensured in_nodes/out_nodes are disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates the target patterns must cover all 10 modes (in_nodes + out_nodes = 4 + 6 = 10). I’ll supply two placeholder 10-digit Fock patterns for the “+” and “–” projectors, ensure in_nodes and out_nodes are disjoint, and rerun.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I mistakenly included the control photon mode in both in_nodes and single_emitters, and also specified out_nodes incorrectly. For a measurement setup, we only need to list the input modes and leave out_nodes empty so that all photons are detected. I'll remove single_emitters and out_nodes, keep in_nodes for the four photonic inputs, and supply two placeholder 10-mode detection patterns for the “+” and “–” outcomes. Then add tries_per_edge for completeness and retry.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement‐style implementation in Pytheus requires num_anc=total photons (inputs+ancilla), in_nodes listing only the input modes, out_nodes left empty so all photons are detected, and target_quantum as Fock patterns over the in_nodes only. We must choose one projector (“+”) to optimize here. This yields 10 total modes (4 in_nodes + 6 ancilla photons from SPDC), and we forbid any direct SPDC source connecting the unknown qubits (removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempts failed because Pytheus requires a non‐empty list of 10‐mode Fock patterns in “target_quantum”, disjoint in_nodes/out_nodes covering all modes, and contiguous node indexing. I’ll supply two placeholder 10‐mode strings for the “+”/“–” projectors, set in_nodes=[0,1,2,9], out_nodes=[3,4,5,6,7,8], num_anc=6, and keep everything else faithful to the researcher’s suggestion.
