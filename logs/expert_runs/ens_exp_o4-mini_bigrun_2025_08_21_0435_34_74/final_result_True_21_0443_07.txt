Mini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell–swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary “+”/“–” outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re Tr(ρ_A ρ_B ρ_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.
