Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Implement the heralded two-photon singlet projector as a single Pytheus config, using two single‐photon ancillas, heralding on their clicks, and leaving the signal outputs undetected.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust to a measurement‐style config: two inputs on nodes [0,1], two ancillas providing two extra detectors, so num_anc = 4 total detectors, out_nodes empty, target_quantum specifying input patterns '01' and '10' with amplitudes [1,-1] to pick out the antisymmetric combination.
