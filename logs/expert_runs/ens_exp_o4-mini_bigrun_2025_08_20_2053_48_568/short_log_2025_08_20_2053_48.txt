Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the researcher’s nonlocal parity‐gate proposal—two single‐photon inputs, a two‐photon Bell‐pair ancilla, post‐selected mapping yielding x⊕y on two detectors, and no direct SPDC linkage between the classical users. I’ll submit this to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error came from using single_emitters at the same nodes as in_nodes. Since Alice and Bob’s inputs are Z-basis emitters and the ancilla Bell pair is from SPDC, we should remove single_emitters. We'll leave num_anc=2, in_nodes for Alice/Bob, out_nodes for the two parity detectors, no single_emitters, and post-select (heralding_out null).

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections constraint was misapplied—SPDC ancilla sources inherently only produce at ancilla modes, so no need to forbid connections involving input nodes. I'll remove removed_connections entirely and resubmit the configuration.
