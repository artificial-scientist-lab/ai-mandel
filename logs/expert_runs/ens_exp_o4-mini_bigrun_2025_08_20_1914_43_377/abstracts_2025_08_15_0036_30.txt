Title: Topology-Protected Bell-Pair Purification via Non-Hermitian SSH Chains

Abstract: We demonstrate a purely static, linear-optical entanglement purification protocol in which each half of two noisy Bell pairs is routed through its own non-Hermitian SSH chain; only in the topological phase do the protected zero-mode channels survive loss and enable a post-selected Bell measurement at the central station. Conditioned on exactly one click in each ancilla detector and the two Bell-measurement clicks, the scheme heralds the target purified Bell pair between Alice and Charlie with near-unity fidelity, despite bulk loss in the chains.
