}###Title: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement–Bandpass Filtering

Mini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement–bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.
