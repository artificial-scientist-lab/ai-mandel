Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s cascaded partial‐Bell filter proposal—heralding a Bell pair on modes 0 and 5 with four ancilla detectors—so I will run pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that specifying out_nodes=[0,5] breaks node contiguity. For a state generation task we should omit in_nodes/out_nodes entirely (or set them to empty lists) so that Pytheus assigns modes 0–1 for the Bell state and nodes 2–5 for ancilla detectors. I’ll remove the out_nodes declaration and try again.
