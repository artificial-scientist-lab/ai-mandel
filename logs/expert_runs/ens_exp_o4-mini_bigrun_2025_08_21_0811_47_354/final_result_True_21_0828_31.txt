}###Title: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong–Ou–Mandel Interferometry

Mini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit—an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometry—that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000⟩±|111⟩)/√2 using only integrated waveguides, 50∶50 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.
