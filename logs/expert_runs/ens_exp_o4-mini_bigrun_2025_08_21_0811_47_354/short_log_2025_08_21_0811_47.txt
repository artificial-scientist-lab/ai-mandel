Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration correctly specifies a heralded on-chip GHZ⁺ measurement supermap using three SPDC Bell‐pair sources, nine detectors (three ancilla and six HOM detectors), inputs on nodes [0,1,2], and targets the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector with amplitudes [1.0,1.0]. All components are within Pytheus’s scope. Passing this to Pytheus for optimization.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates no perfect matchings due to the chosen count-rate loss function with this odd+ancilla setup. Switching to fidelity (‘fid’) should allow optimization of the GHZ⁺ projector without requiring perfect graph matchings, and keeps the target unchanged.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The matching failure arose from an odd detector mismatch—detectors must equal total photons. Adopting the GHZ analyzer template, set num_anc=5 (3 inputs + 2 SPDC ancilla) and num_pre=1 to yield 5 detectors and 5 photons, enabling perfect matchings for |000⟩+|111⟩.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The repeated matching errors arise because pytheus enforces perfect matchings across all detectors (including ancilla), and our GHZ‐analyzer target has an odd total photon count. Pytheus’s measurement‐analyzer format for GHZ (as in the existing GHZ 2d example) uses only three detectors (no ancilla SPDC), with num_anc=3 and num_pre=1. We will revert to that proven template—targeting the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector with no extra ancilla—and trust that this yields a valid configuration.

We adapt that working template—using three SPDC Bell‐pair sources (num_pre=3), five detectors (num_anc=5), targeting the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector with amplitudes [1,1], and keep all other inputs true to the researcher’s HOM‐based GHZ⁺ analyzer suggestion.
