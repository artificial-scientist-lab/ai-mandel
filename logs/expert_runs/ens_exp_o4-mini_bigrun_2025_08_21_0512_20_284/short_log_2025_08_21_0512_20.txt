Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed configuration aligns with the researcher’s nonlocal parity-gate target. I will pass their suggested JSON directly to Pytheus for optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint. Alice and Bob’s inputs shouldn’t be listed as single_emitters. I will clear single_emitters and retry.
