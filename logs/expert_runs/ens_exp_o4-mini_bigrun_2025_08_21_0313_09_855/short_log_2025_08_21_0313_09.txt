Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The amplitude entries for the basis states “11001100” and “11011101” were wrong (they must be +1 and –1 respectively to reflect (–1)^(sum of bits)). I’ve corrected those and converted the config to valid JSON. Now call Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. To fix this, I’ll have data input at modes 0–3 and data output at modes 4–7, then let the four ancilla SPDC photons occupy modes 8–11 and be detected (heralding_out=true). I’ll update removed_connections accordingly between data inputs and ancilla output modes, ensure in_nodes and out_nodes are disjoint, and rerun Pytheus.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arose because I used single_emitters on the same modes as in_nodes. Data qubits aren’t generated by single-emitters, so I will remove single_emitters and any removed_connections. I’ll keep in_nodes and out_nodes disjoint and num_anc=4 from SPDC sources. Then rerun Pytheus.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to assign data-input nodes 0–3, data-output nodes 4–7, and ancilla-photon detectors at nodes 8–11; ensure in_nodes and out_nodes disjoint; use SPDC for ancillas (no single_emitters); forbid any shared source between data inputs and ancilla detections via removed_connections; list all 16 input→output basis mappings with ±1 amplitudes according to parity; then call pytheus.
