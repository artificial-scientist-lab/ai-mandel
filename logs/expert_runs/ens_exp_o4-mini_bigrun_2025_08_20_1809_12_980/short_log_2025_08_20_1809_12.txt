Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed non‐Abelian dissipative holonomy relies on programmable no‐click Kraus maps and weak Lindblad channels, which Pytheus—being a static, post‐selected linear‐optics optimizer—cannot model. We must reject this target as it lies outside the tool’s capabilities.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s proposal requires embedding non-click Kraus maps and dynamic Lindblad dissipators, which lie outside Pytheus’s static, post-selected linear-optics framework and thus cannot be implemented.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: None

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed non‐Abelian dissipative holonomy relies on programmable no‐click Lindblad channels, which are outside Pytheus’s static, post‐selected linear‐optics model. Therefore it cannot be implemented in Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Loss function not specified in config file. Needs to be specified by 'loss_func' key.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed non‐Abelian dissipative holonomy relies on programmable no‐click Lindblad channels and dynamic measurement feedback, which lie outside Pytheus’s static, post‐selected linear‐optics framework and thus cannot be implemented in a valid Pytheus configuration.
