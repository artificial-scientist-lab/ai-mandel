Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration accurately encodes the integrated purification + swap repeater for 3-mode repetition-code Bell pairs, specifying the logical‐Bell output, three ancilla photons, no direct sources between A and C modes, and number‐resolving detection. It's ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because we didn’t distinguish input vs output and heralded ancillas—the system saw only 9 total modes and no matching. We must specify in_nodes (all 12 incoming modes), out_nodes (the 6 surviving A & C modes), and set heralding_out:true so that the 3 SPDC ancillas (2×3=6 photons) are detected. This restores an even total number of nodes (12 in + 6 ancilla =18) and directs Pytheus to find the one‐shot purification+swap transformation.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd‐node and input/output mapping issues can be resolved by treating this as an abstract Fock state generation of the purified logical Bell state in 6 modes, with ancilla pair sources providing 6 photons (num_anc=6) so the total nodes is even. We use loss_func 'fockcr' for Fock‐state count‐rate optimization, omit in_nodes/out_nodes, and enforce no direct pair sources between A(0–2) and C(3–5) via removed_connections.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failures were due to odd‐photon parity and wrong ket formatting. Switch to a Fock‐basis count‐rate task with an even ancilla count (num_anc=6) and express the two logical Bell kets as lists of photon numbers.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failures arose from odd‐node parity and mismatched ket formats. The correct approach is to treat this as a Fock‐state generation problem: we condition on heralding six ancilla photons (num_anc=6) and target a 6‐mode logical Bell state in Fock basis, with count‐rate loss “fockcr” and no explicit in/out nodes. We prevent any single pair source directly linking the three A-modes (0–2) to the three C-modes (3–5) via removed_connections. This ensures an even total photon number and proper matching.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The superposition of vacuum and six-photon components violates constant-photon constraints in Fock-based tasks, so we recast it as a discrete-variable generation problem: we demand a single-shot post-selected circuit producing either the 12-mode DV strings "000000000000000000" or "111000000111000000" (six logical photons in modes 0–2 and 9–11, zeros elsewhere), with six SPDC ancillas heralded (num_anc=6), blocking any direct A–C pair source.
