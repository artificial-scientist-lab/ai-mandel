Title: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |Φ⁺>ₗ between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.
