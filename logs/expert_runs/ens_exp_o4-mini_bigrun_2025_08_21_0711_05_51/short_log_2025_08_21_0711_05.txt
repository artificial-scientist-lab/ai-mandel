Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s proposal is to implement a heralded teleportation channel across a 3×3 toroidal Bell‐pair PEPS via postselected entanglement‐swap loops. In Pytheus this can be encoded as a 1→1 qubit transformation (“identity” channel) with 36 ancillary photons (18 edges × 2 detectors each) and heralded operation. The target is the identity mapping |0>→|0>, |1>→|1> between nodes A and B, postselecting on all ancilla clicks (heralding). I will set loss_func to “fid” to maximize teleportation fidelity, use number-resolving detectors, and list the 36 ancilla detector nodes. This stays true to the original suggestion.
