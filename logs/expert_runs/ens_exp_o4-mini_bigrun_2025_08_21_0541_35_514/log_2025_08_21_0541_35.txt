    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool.

Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "output": "Thought: The requested VQA\u2010style entanglement classifier is fundamentally not a pure state transformation or measurement that Pytheus can optimize via fidelity or count\u2010rate\u2013based losses. There is no single \u201ctarget_quantum\u201d mapping or Fock\u2010state signature that encodes a training set of GHZ vs. W and a classical classification error. In other words, Pytheus cannot directly ingest a binary classification loss across two families of unknown inputs. Thus no valid configuration can satisfy both the researcher\u2019s classification goal and Pytheus\u2019s schema without altering the target. I must therefore acknowledge that this proposal is outside Pytheus\u2019s present capabilities."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "output": "Thought: The researcher\u2019s protocol targets a VQA\u2010driven classification loss (\u2018classification_error\u2019) without any explicit quantum \u201ctarget\u201d to optimize. PyTheus fundamentally requires a well\u2010defined quantum transformation or measurement (a target_quantum) and supports only its built-in loss functions (\u2018fid\u2019, \u2018cr\u2019, \u2018fockfid\u2019, \u2018fockcr\u2019, \u2018ent\u2019, or the custom \u2018lff\u2019 tied to a provided target). Since there is no concrete target_quantum or standard loss that encodes \u201cclassification_error,\u201d it is impossible to directly implement a VQA classifier in PyTheus without altering the researcher\u2019s proposal. Therefore, I must conclude that this suggestion cannot be realized by PyTheus as currently specified.\n\nFinal Answer:  \nI\u2019m sorry, but PyTheus cannot implement a VQA\u2010based GHZ vs W classifier as described because it lacks a well\u2010defined quantum target and loss function for classification."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "output": "Thought: PyTheus only supports static quantum transformations or measurements with a well\u2010defined `target_quantum`. It cannot synthesize a parameterized variational classifier with a custom \u201cclassification_error\u201d loss. Because the user\u2019s goal is a dynamic VQA loop rather than a fixed state transformation or measurement scheme, there is no valid PyTheus configuration that realizes the GHZ vs. W classifier.  \n\nFinal Answer:  \nIt is not possible to encode a variational entanglement\u2010classifier network (GHZ vs. W) as a single static PyTheus target. PyTheus requires a concrete `target_quantum` (a state or transformation) and does not accommodate a classical VQA optimization loop. We therefore cannot generate a working config for the requested protocol under the current capabilities of PyTheus."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot22_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,2) gate, which means that we have a qubit acting as the control and another qubit acting as the target.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible transformation (not mere state generation):\n  a) A variational photonic classifier that distinguishes GHZ\u2010class vs W\u2010class tripartite states using a tunable interferometer and photon\u2010count detectors.  \n  b) A variational \u201centanglement router\u201d that adaptively re\u2010wires Bell links on demand (drifts into state generation).  \n  c) A variational indefinite\u2010order supermap (yet still too close to known switches).  \nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  a) The classifier is genuinely a network\u2010transformation (takes in unknown tripartite inputs and outputs a classification), directly uses a VQA to tune an interferometer to witness genuine multipartite entanglement classes. Pytheus can design the static interferometer+detector layout given \u201cin_nodes\u201d as inputs, ancilla detectors, and \u201closs_func\u201d as classification error.  \n  b) & c) were ruled out previously.  \nStep 3: Select (a).\nStep 4: Novelty: No one has used a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical network plus a classical VQA to distinguish between inequivalent multipartite entanglement classes (GHZ vs W). This is a new use of quantum networks as classifiers for entanglement structure.  \nStep 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can place three \u201cin_nodes\u201d for the incoming qubit\u2010photons, search for a small interferometer with internal beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters, and a set of detectors whose click patterns serve as features. A classical optimizer tunes the interferometer parameters to minimize classification error on training sets of GHZ vs W states.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nWe propose a Variational Photonic Entanglement\u2010Classifier network that takes unknown tripartite qubit inputs and learns, via a VQA loop, to distinguish GHZ\u2010class from W\u2010class states.  \n\n1) Resources  \n \u2022 in_nodes = [0,1,2]: three input qubits (Alice, Bob, Charlie) provided externally.  \n \u2022 single_emitters = []  \n \u2022 pair sources = none (we only route inputs).  \n\n2) Static network (designed by Pytheus)  \n \u2022 A small linear\u2010optical interferometer mixing the three input modes with 1\u20132 ancillary vacuum modes.  \n \u2022 Parameterized beam\u2010splitter ratios r\u2081,\u2026,r\u2096 and phase\u2010shifter angles \u03c6\u2081,\u2026,\u03c6\u2098 that serve as the VQA knobs.  \n \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes (anc_detectors = [3,4,5,6,7,\u2026]).  \n\n3) Output classification  \n \u2022 From the click pattern histogram P(c) over the ancilla detectors we define a decision rule (e.g. majority vote or threshold).  \n \u2022 The classical loss_func is the classification error on a training set of known GHZ vs W inputs.  \n\n4) Variational loop  \n \u2022 Initialize parameters {r_i,\u03c6_j}.  \n \u2022 For each training batch: feed in a known GHZ or W state, run the network, record clicks, compute error.  \n \u2022 Aggregate across the batch, compute loss, and update {r_i,\u03c6_j} via a classical optimizer (e.g. L-BFGS-B).  \n \u2022 Repeat until error converges.  \n\n5) Pytheus config sketch  \n{  \n  description: 'VQA classifier for GHZ vs W tripartite entanglement',  \n  foldername: 'VQA_Ent_Classify_3node',  \n  in_nodes: [0,1,2],  \n  out_nodes: [],  \n  anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6,7],  \n  num_anc: 5,  \n  single_emitters: [],  \n  removed_connections: [],  \n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',  \n  loss_func: 'classification_error',  \n  samples: 20,  \n  number_resolving: true,  \n  thresholds: [0.2,0.1]  \n}  \n\n6) Why this hits the marks  \n \u2022 It is not state generation but a genuine network\u2010transformation: a classifier that ingests unknown entangled states and outputs a decision.  \n \u2022 It directly fuses \u201cgenuine multipartite entanglement\u201d (GHZ vs W classes) with a \u201cvariational quantum algorithm\u201d that tunes linear\u2010optical parameters.  \n \u2022 It leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to design small interferometers and detection layouts under abstract qubit encodings.  \n \u2022 Once the Expert has the Pytheus\u2010output circuit, they implement the tunable beam\u2010splitters/phase\u2010shifters and train the VQA in the lab.  \n\nThis protocol opens a new domain: programmable entanglement\u2010class classification networks in photonics, with applications in quantum certification, debugging of network nodes, and automated quantum\u2010network tomography.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The original suggestion used an unsupported loss function name.
