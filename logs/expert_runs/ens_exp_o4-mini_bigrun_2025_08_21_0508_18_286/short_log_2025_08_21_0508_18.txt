Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration correctly encodes the dual‐rail control qubit, two Bell‐pair inputs, and the two heralded functions via target_quantum patterns. I added out_nodes to specify that all six modes are preserved as outputs. Now I'll launch Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because out_nodes overlaps with in_nodes. By removing the out_nodes key, Pytheus will default to using all target photons as outputs, satisfying the disjointness requirement.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The single‐photon emitter must occupy a mode distinct from the incoming SPDC modes, so I move it to mode 6 to avoid overlap with in_nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We must satisfy Pytheus’s constraint that each input or emitter must exit via an output node or an ancilla detector. By explicitly marking the control qubit modes [0,1] as the only outputs (out_nodes), the other five in_nodes plus the single_emitter mode each exit into an ancilla (num_anc=6). This meets the requirement 6_anc + 2_out ≥ 7_paths.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Remove the single_emitter entry so that all six inputs (control rails + Bell‐pair rails) count as in_nodes; with no out_nodes, the default is that control and output photons remain undetected, and ancilla SPDC photons (num_anc=6) are heralded. This satisfies Pytheus’s detector bookkeeping.
