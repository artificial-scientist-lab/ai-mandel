Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I spotted errors in the mapping strings (they must be “ijij” for input→output) and we also need to preserve the output qutrits (heralding_out=true) so that only the hub ancilla are detected. I’ll fix target_quantum and set heralding_out to true.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error states that the total photon number is odd (2 inputs + 3 ancilla = 5) which can’t form perfect matchings. We must choose an even number of ancilla photons. Changing num_anc to 4 makes the total photons = 2 + 4 = 6, allowing perfect matchings.
