Title:  
Joint Star‐and‐Plaquette Syndrome Extraction for a Minimal Toric‐Code Logical Qubit via a Single Linear‐Optical Module

Mini‐abstract:  
We demonstrate a static linear‐optical network that concurrently measures the star (X₁X₂X₃X₄) and plaquette (Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄) stabilizers of a single logical qubit encoded in the toric code—our explicit target. By employing only two Bell‐pair ancilla sources, beam splitters, basis rotations, and photon‐number–resolving detectors, the scheme entangles four ancilla photons with four data photons to extract both syndromes in one shot, cutting the ancilla overhead by 50% and eliminating the need for feed‐forward.
