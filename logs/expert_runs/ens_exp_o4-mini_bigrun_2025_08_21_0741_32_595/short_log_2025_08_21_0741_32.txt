Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration defines a post-selected linear‐optics teleportation channel acting as an identity on a qutrit (d=3) from input mode 0 to output mode 2, using four ancilla photons in modes 3–6 measured by number-resolving detectors. We ban any direct 0→2 connection to enforce teleportation, herald only on ancilla clicks so the output emerges unmeasured, and optimize the fidelity (‘fid’) of the identity map on basis states [|0>,|1>,|2>].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust node indexing so that input is node 0, four ancilla photons occupy nodes 1–4, and output is node 5. in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[5], anc_detectors=[1,2,3,4], removed_connections=[[0,5]] to ban direct input→output, target_quantum mappings ["00","11","22"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node index error arises because Pytheus expects ancilla photons provided by single_emitters rather than just anc_detectors. I’ll assign nodes 1–4 as single_emitters for the four ancilla photons, drop anc_detectors, and keep input at 0, output at 5, ensuring nodes {0–5} are contiguous.
