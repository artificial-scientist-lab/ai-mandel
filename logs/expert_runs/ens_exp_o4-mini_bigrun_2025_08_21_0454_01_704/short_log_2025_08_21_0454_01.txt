Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the researcher’s PT‐enhanced teleportation CNOT proposal, using four SPDC sources (two for entanglement pairs, two ancillas for the PT filter), forbidding unwanted connections, and heralding with number‐resolving detectors. We set up a post‐selected CNOT mapping with in/out nodes [0,3], ancilla count 4, and proper loss function and optimization parameters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was caused by overlapping in_nodes and out_nodes. I’ve now defined separate input and output indices ([0,1] and [2,3]) and included all SPDC‐source photons as ancillas (num_anc=8). I’ve also applied the forbidden‐connection constraints to enforce nonlocal separation.
