}###Title: Heralded Linear-Optical SPA-PT Supermap for Direct Entanglement Negativity and Concurrent CHSH Testing

Mini‐abstract: We implement a heralded linear-optical supermap that realizes the structural-physical approximation to the partial transpose (SPA-PT)—our target transformation—on one copy of an unknown two-qubit state, producing an output whose fidelity directly yields the state’s entanglement negativity. Simultaneously, a second untouched copy is routed to a standard CHSH Bell-test network, enabling parallel measurement of conventional nonlocal correlations and negativity using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, vacuum ancilla, and photon-number-resolving detectors.
