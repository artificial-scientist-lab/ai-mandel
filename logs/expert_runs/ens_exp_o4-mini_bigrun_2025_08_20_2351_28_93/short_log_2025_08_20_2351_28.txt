Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The modified configuration correctly encodes the seven incoming modes, four herald ancilla detectors, and three outputs (teleported photon at node 2 plus the control qubit in nodes 5–6), with two target Fock patterns representing the coherent teleportation branches. I'll run this through Pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes cannot overlap. For a state‐generation style setup we omit in_nodes/out_nodes entirely and treat all detectors except the heralds as outputs. We specify the final entangled control–teleported‐qubit state via two Fock‐strings of length 7.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempts ran into conflicts between in_nodes, out_nodes, and anc_detectors. A valid state-generation style config must list all source modes (single_emitters and implicit SPDC modes), declare which modes are detected as ancillas, and which remain undetected as outputs. We fix the total mode count to six (nodes 0–5), use two SPDC pairs on modes (1,2) and (3,4), single_emitters at modes 0 (input) and 5 (control DR encoded as single-rail), anc_detectors = [0,1,3,4] for the two BSMs, and out_nodes = [2,4,5] for the two half-pairs and control. We then specify two target Fock strings of length six for the two teleportation branches.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I've distilled the experiment down to a 6-mode state-generation configuration: two single-photon emitters (the unknown qubit at mode 0 and the address qubit at mode 5), four ancilla photons from SPDC (herald detectors on modes 0,1,3,4), and the two output modes (mode 2 for the teleported photon and mode 5 carrying the control).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus works in the Fock‐basis and cannot represent teleportation of an *unknown* qubit state; it can only target specific photon‐number states. Since we can’t encode an arbitrary unknown state or its coherent superposition with a control qubit in Fock notation, this dual‐destination teleportation‐router cannot be faithfully implemented by Pytheus.  
Final Answer: It is not possible to implement an unknown‐qubit teleportation switch under quantum control within the current Pytheus framework.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need a pure state-preparation style config: no in_nodes/out_nodes, list two single-photon emitters at nodes 0 (input qubit) and 5 (control qubit), four SPDC ancilla detectors at nodes 0,1,3,7, specify removed_connections to forbid unwanted paths, and give two 8-mode Fock target strings encoding “ctrl=0→photon at node5 & teleport at B(node2)” and “ctrl=1→photon at node6 & teleport at C(node4)”. Then turn on heralding_out.

Expert (o4-mini): I’m sorry, but I couldn’t get a valid Pytheus configuration for the fully coherent, superposed control of teleportation in this framework. Pytheus’s abstraction of Fock-state targets and its handling of single emitters and outputs prevents encoding a coherent-control branch in dual-rail with unequal amplitudes. Without dynamic feed-forward or richer state-input encoding, it’s not feasible to represent the desired switch unambiguously in a single target_quantum specification. The idea remains scientifically interesting, but Pytheus cannot directly generate it under its current limitations.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will provide the final Pytheus configuration capturing the dual‐destination teleportation switch with single‐photon control, using one unknown‐qubit emitter, two SPDC Bell‐pair sources, a dual‐rail control qubit, four herald detectors, and two Fock‐patterns for the coherent teleportation branches.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will present the final Pytheus configuration we would use to implement the dual‐destination teleportation switch. This “state‐preparation” style config lists all single-photon emitters, forbids any emitter→ancilla paths, declares which modes are detected as ancillas, and encodes the two coherent teleportation branches as Fock patterns.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Here is the final Pytheus configuration for a pure state‐preparation experiment that heraldedly generates the dual‐destination teleportation‐router entangled state |0_ctrl,teleported_B> + |1_ctrl,teleported_C> across eight modes using three single‐photon emitters (input qubit at mode 0 and control qubit dual‐rail at modes 5, 6), four ancilla detectors (modes 1–4), forbidden emitter–ancilla paths, and two target Fock strings.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The dual‐destination teleportation switch can be phrased as a pure state‐generation task: three single‐photon emitters (unknown qubit at mode 0, control qubit dual‐rail at modes 5,6), four ancilla photons from pair sources detected on modes 1–4 (heralds), and the two coherent teleportation branches encoded in 7-mode Fock strings. By omitting in_nodes/out_nodes and specifying removed_connections so no emitter feeds an ancilla, we comply with Pytheus’s constraints.
