SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration had inconsistent node counts: num_pre was 1 instead of 2, out_nodes referred to indices that didn't exist in a 10-mode network, and target_quantum strings were 10 digits long instead of matching only the in/out modes. I've corrected num_pre to 2, expanded the network to 12 modes so that 2 pre + 8 anc + 2 out = 12, set out_nodes to [10,11], and reduced target_quantum to 4-digit strings ["1010","0101"] mapping input to output.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error arose because the target node indices must form a contiguous range starting at zero. We should treat this as a four-mode transformation (two inputs, two outputs), with ancillas created via SPDC (num_anc) rather than adding them to the node count. We map dual-rail input modes [0,1] to output modes [2,3], so target_quantum strings are 4-digits. We forbid any direct SPDC source from input to output via removed_connections [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]. All indices now span {0,1,2,3}. Action: pytheus
