Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to configure Pytheus to search for a fully passive, post‐selected 4D Bell‐state analyzer. I’ll specify 8 input signal modes (two ququarts), 2 ancillas, use number‐resolving detectors, list all 16 basis patterns of the four Bell states in “target_quantum,” enforce no common source between ququart modes via “removed_connections,” and mark the last two modes as single‐photon emitters for the ancillas.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates I underestimated the number of detectors for a full measurement network. For a measurement task, num_anc must equal the total number of detectors (here 10), and single_emitters should be left empty; the signal inputs are given. I'll update num_anc to 10 and clear single_emitters.
