Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will invoke Pytheus to design a static three-photon measurement device that heralds a projection onto the GHZ+ subspace |000>+|111>, using two ancilla photons from an SPDC source and three unknown qubits on modes 0–2.

Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The earlier error arose because explicitly setting out_nodes to an empty list forced Pytheus to see zero output modes, violating the minimal detector count. By removing out_nodes entirely (so Pytheus uses its default of treating the 3 target modes as outputs) the balance is restored and num_anc=2 becomes valid. I'll remove the out_nodes key and retry.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement projector onto GHZ+ requires enough ancilla photons to build perfect matchings; matching the GHZ-analyzer example uses num_anc=5 for a 3-mode projector. I will set num_anc=5 and remove out_nodes so the three inputs are the only outputs.
