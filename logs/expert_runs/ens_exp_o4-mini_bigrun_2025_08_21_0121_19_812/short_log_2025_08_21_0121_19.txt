Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher's joint two-qubit GHZ‐projection teleportation protocol exactly—two ancilla photons from SPDC, post-selection heralding, Bob’s outputs undetected, and forbidden direct connections—so we can run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The solver failed with only two ancillas and strict routing constraints, so I’ll give it more ancilla photons (num_anc=4) and slightly relax the success threshold to improve feasibility—keeping the teleportation target and forbidden-connections intact.
