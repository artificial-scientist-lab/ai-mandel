}###Title: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00⟩+|11⟩ Bell Pairs

Mini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.
