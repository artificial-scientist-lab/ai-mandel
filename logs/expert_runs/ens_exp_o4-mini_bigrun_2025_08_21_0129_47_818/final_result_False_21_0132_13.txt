}###Title:  
Heralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses

Mini-Abstract:  
We implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch—heralded by ancilla photon clicks—to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.
