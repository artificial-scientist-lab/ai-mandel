Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed Pytheus configuration encodes two SPDC sources on (modes 0–1) and (2–3), two vacuum‐ancilla amplitude‐damping beam splitters coupling modes 0→4 and 2→5 with ancilla detectors [4,5], a static 50:50 routing BS network mixing modes 0 and 2, and post‐selection on exactly one ancilla click together with detection of outputs on modes [0,1,2] yielding target_quantum outcomes “110” (entanglement to B) or “101” (to C). We set num_pre=2, num_anc=2, heralding_out=false so outputs and ancillas click, and number_resolving=true. This fully matches the idea for a heralded amplitude‐damping entanglement router certified by tomographic witnesses.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error arose because our target kets spanned an odd number of modes, making perfect matchings impossible. To fix this, we introduce an explicit “dump” mode (always zero in the target) so that our out_nodes list has four modes—two signal modes plus one dump mode—and we require exactly two photons on the out_nodes and two ancilla clicks. We set num_anc=4 to create two SPDC Bell sources (producing 4 photons), encode the two routing outcomes as kets of length four (“1100” for A_r–B, “1010” for A_r–C, with the dump mode empty), and list ancilla detectors [4,5]. This yields an even total number of photons and should allow the search to find the heralded amplitude‐damping router.
