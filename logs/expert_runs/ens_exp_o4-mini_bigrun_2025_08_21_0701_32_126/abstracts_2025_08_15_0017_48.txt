Title: Z₃ Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition

Abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |ψ⟩ from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z₃ phase imprint diag(1,e^{2πi/3},e^{4πi/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {∣0⟩,∣1⟩,∣2⟩}, directly encoding the network’s Z₃ loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.
