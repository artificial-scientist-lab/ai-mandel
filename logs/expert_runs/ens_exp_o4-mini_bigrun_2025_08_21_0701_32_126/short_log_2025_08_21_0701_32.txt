Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration faithfully captures the Z₃ triple-path teleportation channel: one input qutrit (node 0), one output qutrit (node 1), three parallel Bell-swap measurements via six ancillas (num_anc=6, heralding_out=true), forbidden direct source–sink (removed_connections=[[0,1]]), a 3×3 interferometer enabling e^{2πi/3} phases (imaginary=true), and the nine Choi-state mappings in target_quantum. Ready to run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (1 in + 1 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because target_quantum entries had length 4 while in_nodes+out_nodes count is 2. For a 1-in/1-out qutrit gate, target_quantum strings must be two characters long. I'll redefine target_quantum as ["00","11","22"] with corresponding Z₃ phases in amplitudes using polar form, set imaginary to "polar", and match in_nodes/out_nodes correctly.
