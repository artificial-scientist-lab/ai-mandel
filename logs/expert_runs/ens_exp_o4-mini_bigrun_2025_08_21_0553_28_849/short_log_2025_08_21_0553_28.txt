SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested JSON matches the one‐shot three‐photon repetition‐code teleportation with majority decoding, preserving φ‐coherence. It correctly encodes the Boolean majority map in `target_quantum`, specifies `in_nodes` and `out_nodes`, forbids any direct A→C sources via `removed_connections`, and uses `heralding_out=true` so that only ancilla detectors click, leaving mode 8 as the logical output. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because node indices must be contiguous from 0 to N−1. I’ll change out_nodes to [3] and restrict removed_connections to forbid direct A→C links ([0,3],[1,3],[2,3]). Now nodes are {0,1,2,3} matching the 4-bit target_quantum strings.
