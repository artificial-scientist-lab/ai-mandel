Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to encode the closed‐loop teleportation as a two‐qubit controlled‐phase gate that applies the Zak phase (π for β/α>1) on the |11⟩ component of the input and reference, with four ancilla Bell measurements and forbidding shortcuts on the SSH ring. We'll encode it as a heralded CZ‐type transformation on two qubits, with target_quantum and amplitudes matching a phase of π (−1) on |11⟩, num_anc=4, removed_connections [[0,2],[1,3]], anc_detectors [4,5,6,7], and in/out nodes [0,1] → [2,3].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: thresholds not defined in config file. Please define thresholds as list of floats (length = 2).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates I forgot to include the required thresholds field. I'll add thresholds and required optional keys to match Pytheus’s expected schema without changing the target transformation.
