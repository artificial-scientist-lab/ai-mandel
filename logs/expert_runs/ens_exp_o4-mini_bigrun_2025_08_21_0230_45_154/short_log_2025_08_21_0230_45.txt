Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration must faithfully represent the catalytic swapping protocol: three SPDC sources, no extra ancilla photons, heralded preparation of two Bell pairs on modes [0,1] and [6,7], passive 6-mode interferometer mixing inner modes [2–5], number-resolving detection on the four swap modes, and preservation of the catalyst on [6,7]. We set in_nodes to empty (state generation), out_nodes to [0,1,6,7] (the two Bell pairs), heralding_out=true (we detect only the swap modes), and forbid any direct source→outer bypass via removed_connections. All other parameters follow the researcher’s suggestion.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 0 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I specified target_quantum with eight modes but only four nodes. For state generation I should use four output modes (A,B,X′,Y′) and four heralding detectors (ancilla) separately. I'll set target_quantum to four‐mode Bell pairs ["0000","0011","1100","1111"], num_anc=4, out_nodes empty (all four are outputs), heralding_out=true (detect ancillas only), and forbid direct AB sources with removed_connections:[[0,1]].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjusting for state-generation syntax: four output qubits across modes [0,1,2,3] (A,B,X′,Y′), four ancilla photons mixed and detected, forbidding direct AB source. Set num_anc=4, target_quantum length=4 strings, thresholds included, in_nodes/out_nodes empty, heralding_out true, number_resolving true.
