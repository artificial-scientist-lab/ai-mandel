Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I've translated the partial‐SWAP gate U(π/4)=cos(π/4)I+i sin(π/4)SWAP into a Pytheus config, listing the six nonzero input→output terms and their complex amplitudes (in cartesian form), specified two ancilla photons, heralded outputs, number‐resolving detectors, and fidelity loss. I will now call Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Target state had invalid format and could not be created.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The invalid format arose from mismatched complex amplitude encoding and the wrong imaginary flag. I'll switch the imaginary key to "cartesian" and correct the amplitude ordering to align with the target mappings.
