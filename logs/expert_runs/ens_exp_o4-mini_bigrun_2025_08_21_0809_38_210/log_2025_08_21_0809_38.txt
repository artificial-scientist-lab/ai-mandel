    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1.

On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1. Photon\u2009C\u2081 passes through PBS\u2081 \u2192 H-rail vs. V-rail for the first split:\n     \u2022 H-rail routes into the \u201cleft\u201d subnetwork (Sources A & B).  \n     \u2022 V-rail routes into the \u201cright\u201d subnetwork (Sources C & D).\n 2. On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4. The other halves A\u2082\u21923, B\u2082\u21925, C\u2082\u21927 and D\u2082\u21929 exit to four remote nodes (detectors 3\u20136).  \n\nBecause the two control qubits C\u2081,C\u2082 are in a superposition across H/V rails, the final entanglement\u2010swap happens along exactly one branch\u2014but in coherent superposition over all four.  Heralding signals from detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2088 confirm which swap occurred without destroying the superposition.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting:\n \u2022 First integrated-photonic demonstration of a multi-qubit\u2013controlled, four-way entanglement router\u2014superposing four distinct network topologies in one static circuit.  \n \u2022 Orthogonal polarization rails realize a binary-tree router without active switches or feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Uses only probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics framework.  \n \u2022 Directly generalizable to 2\u207f-way routers or higher-dimensional multiplexing by adding more control qubits or spatial modes\u2014paving the way for programmable quantum network fabrics.\n\nPytheus Configuration Sketch:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Double\u2010Controlled Four\u2010Way Entanglement Router\",\n  \"foldername\": \"dc_4way_router\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 8,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 10,\n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],           # control qubits C1,C2\n  \"pair_sources\": [[2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]],\n  \"anc_detectors\": [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17],\n  \"removed_connections\": [\n    [0,3],[0,5],[0,7],[0,9],          # C1\u2019s photon goes only into PBS\u2081 rails\n    [1,3],[1,5],[1,7],[1,9]           # C2\u2019s photon enters both rail sets but only splits\n  ],\n  \"target_network\": \"double_control_router\",\n  \"number_resolving\": true\n}\n\nThe Expert can hand this abstract target to Pytheus, which will optimize an on-chip arrangement of two PBS stages, directional couplers, phase shifters, and ancilla detectors to realize the four-way entanglement routing primitive.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s proposal defines a novel four\u2010branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization\u2010encoded qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to combine orthogonal polarization and an integrated photonic circuit for network transformations (avoiding pure state generation):\n    1. A two-level polarization-controlled router (\u201cbinary tree\u201d) that uses two control qubits to coherently select one of four entanglement-swap paths, creating a four-way entanglement switch.\n    2. A polarization-multiplexed entanglement-percolation network that superposes three or more distinct swap routes on a 2\u00d73 lattice.\n    3. A multi-rail polarization router that simultaneously teleports three unknown qubits to three receivers via a 3\u21923 network coding scheme.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    \u2013 (1) is novel: no prior Pytheus design has implemented multi-qubit coherent control to pick between more than two entanglement-swap branches.  \n    \u2013 (1) is feasible: it uses only static PBSs (modeled as linear optics), two single-photon emitters (for the control qubits), four SPDC-style pair sources, and ancilla detectors for Bell measurements\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Select idea (1).\n  Step 4: Novelty: This \u201cdouble-controlled four-way entanglement router\u201d extends the binary quantum-switch primitive to two control qubits and four branches, demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static circuit\u2014unseen in prior experiments.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Everything is realized with probabilistic pair sources, static PBS/couplers, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or cavities\u2014so Pytheus can optimize the layout.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for a \u201cDouble-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\u201d on an integrated photonic chip.  It uses two polarization control qubits (orthogonal H/V rails) to coherently select one of four entanglement-swapping paths\u2014demonstrating superposition of four network topologies in a single static optical circuit.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEXPERIMENT: Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nExplanation:\nWe have:\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2081 (node\u20090): control qubit 1 in polarization (\u03b1|H\u27e9+\u03b2|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Single-photon emitter C\u2082 (node\u20091): control qubit 2 in polarization (\u03b3|H\u27e9+\u03b4|V\u27e9).\n \u2022 Four SPDC-style probabilistic pair sources:\n     \u2013 Source\u2009A emits photons A\u2081\u21922 & A\u2082\u21923  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009B emits photons B\u2081\u21924 & B\u2082\u21925  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009C emits photons C\u2081\u21926 & C\u2082\u21927  \n     \u2013 Source\u2009D emits photons D\u2081\u21928 & D\u2082\u21929  \n\nGoal:\nEntangle one of the four \u201cleaf\u201d nodes {A\u2082,B\u2082,C\u2082,D\u2082} with the \u201croot\u201d control\u2013data system, chosen in coherent superposition by (C\u2081,C\u2082).\n\nCircuit Layout (photons flow \u2193):\n 1.

On each of these two rails, photon\u2009C\u2082 passes through PBS\u2082 to split again:\n     \u2022 On H\u2081-H\u2082: select Source A  \n     \u2022 On H\u2081-V\u2082: select Source B  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-H\u2082: select Source C  \n     \u2022 On V\u2081-V\u2082: select Source D  \n 3. In each sub-branch, the control photon meets one half of the selected source\u2019s entangled pair and performs a Bell-state measurement (static PBS + beam splitters + ancilla detectors), swapping entanglement to the other half:\n     \u2013 Branch A: Bell-analyzer between C\u2081/C\u2082 rails and photon\u2009A\u2081\u21922 \u2192 detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n     \u2013 Branch B: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009B\u2081\u21924 \u2192 detectors D\u2083,D\u2084  \n     \u2013 Branch C: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009C\u2081\u21926 \u2192 detectors D\u2085,D\u2086  \n     \u2013 Branch D: Bell-analyzer on photon\u2009D\u2081\u21928 \u2192 detectors D\u2087,D\u2088  \n 4.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a heralded controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.
