    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to meaningfully combine \u201cquantum tensor network\u201d and \u201cLindblad equation\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible experiment (no cavities/resonators, no forbidden state generation, focus on quantum networks/transformations).\n  \n  1) Collision\u2010model tensor network: implement a photonic collision model as a matrix\u2010product\u2010operator network. A single \u201csystem\u201d photon sequentially interacts (via beam splitters) with ancilla Bell pairs. Measuring those ancillas implements a small\u2010time Lindblad map. By stringing N steps you simulate Markovian open\u2010system evolution. Cross\u2013ancilla beam\u2010splitter links introduce memory (non-Markovian) and yield a process tensor MPS.\n  \n  2) Teleportation-based Lindblad channel: teleport an unknown input qubit through an entanglement-swapping network engineered (via choice of beam-splitter reflectivities and ancilla measurements) to realize a target Lindblad channel (e.g. amplitude damping or dephasing). This uses the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism\u2014prepare ancilla Bell pairs, swap, detect ancillas\u2014and herald the channel action on the output. By concatenating modules, one obtains discrete steps of L-driven evolution.\n  \n  3) Distributed dissipative tensor network: prepare multiple system qubits at different nodes. Use shared Bell\u2010pair resources and local entanglement swapping to implement coupling terms of a dissipative spin chain (e.g. boundary\u2010driven XX chain at Lindblad steady state). Nodes A\u2013B share ancillas; B\u2013C share ancillas, etc. Local joint measurements enact local jump operators. One measures correlations among system nodes to probe the dissipative phase diagram.\n\nStep 2: Novelty / obstacles  \n  1) Collision\u2010model MPS is new for pytheus (past experiments only generated pure entangled states or unitary gates). The only obstacle is mapping \u201csequential interactions + measurements\u201d into static linear\u2010optical network\u2014but Pytheus can optimize a static network with many ancillas.  \n  2) Teleportation channel simulation is conceptually simple but close to standard entanglement\u2010swapping recipes.  \n  3) Distributed dissipative chain is rich but resembles generating many Bell pairs plus joint measurements\u2014less clearly highlighting \u201ctensor network + Lindblad.\u201d\n\nStep 3: Pick the collision\u2010model MPS idea. It is both novel (first open\u2010system simulation via photonic tensor network modules) and feasible: uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, and no dynamic feedforward.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because nobody has proposed using a one\u2010dimensional photonic MPS of ancilla interactions to simulate a Lindblad master equation and explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes in a single linear\u2010optical network.\n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires designing a static linear\u2010optical network: one system input mode, N ancilla Bell\u2010pair sources, beam splitters between system and ancilla modes at each step, and photon detectors on ancillas. Pytheus can optimize connection patterns and beam\u2010splitter parameters to approximate the desired Lindblad generator for each discrete time step, and string these steps into an overall network.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is my proposal for the Expert:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cCollision\u2010model simulation of Lindblad open\u2010system dynamics via a photonic matrix\u2010product operator (MPO) network.\u201d\n\nExplanation & Visualization:\nWe treat one \u201csystem\u201d qubit (mode S) and a chain of N ancilla qubit pairs (Bell\u2010pair sources).

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to meaningfully combine \u201cquantum tensor network\u201d and \u201cLindblad equation\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible experiment (no cavities/resonators, no forbidden state generation, focus on quantum networks/transformations).\n  \n  1) Collision\u2010model tensor network: implement a photonic collision model as a matrix\u2010product\u2010operator network. A single \u201csystem\u201d photon sequentially interacts (via beam splitters) with ancilla Bell pairs. Measuring those ancillas implements a small\u2010time Lindblad map. By stringing N steps you simulate Markovian open\u2010system evolution. Cross\u2013ancilla beam\u2010splitter links introduce memory (non-Markovian) and yield a process tensor MPS.\n  \n  2) Teleportation-based Lindblad channel: teleport an unknown input qubit through an entanglement-swapping network engineered (via choice of beam-splitter reflectivities and ancilla measurements) to realize a target Lindblad channel (e.g. amplitude damping or dephasing). This uses the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism\u2014prepare ancilla Bell pairs, swap, detect ancillas\u2014and herald the channel action on the output. By concatenating modules, one obtains discrete steps of L-driven evolution.\n  \n  3) Distributed dissipative tensor network: prepare multiple system qubits at different nodes. Use shared Bell\u2010pair resources and local entanglement swapping to implement coupling terms of a dissipative spin chain (e.g. boundary\u2010driven XX chain at Lindblad steady state). Nodes A\u2013B share ancillas; B\u2013C share ancillas, etc. Local joint measurements enact local jump operators. One measures correlations among system nodes to probe the dissipative phase diagram.\n\nStep 2: Novelty / obstacles  \n  1) Collision\u2010model MPS is new for pytheus (past experiments only generated pure entangled states or unitary gates). The only obstacle is mapping \u201csequential interactions + measurements\u201d into static linear\u2010optical network\u2014but Pytheus can optimize a static network with many ancillas.  \n  2) Teleportation channel simulation is conceptually simple but close to standard entanglement\u2010swapping recipes.  \n  3) Distributed dissipative chain is rich but resembles generating many Bell pairs plus joint measurements\u2014less clearly highlighting \u201ctensor network + Lindblad.\u201d\n\nStep 3: Pick the collision\u2010model MPS idea. It is both novel (first open\u2010system simulation via photonic tensor network modules) and feasible: uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, and no dynamic feedforward.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because nobody has proposed using a one\u2010dimensional photonic MPS of ancilla interactions to simulate a Lindblad master equation and explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes in a single linear\u2010optical network.\n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires designing a static linear\u2010optical network: one system input mode, N ancilla Bell\u2010pair sources, beam splitters between system and ancilla modes at each step, and photon detectors on ancillas. Pytheus can optimize connection patterns and beam\u2010splitter parameters to approximate the desired Lindblad generator for each discrete time step, and string these steps into an overall network.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is my proposal for the Expert:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cCollision\u2010model simulation of Lindblad open\u2010system dynamics via a photonic matrix\u2010product operator (MPO) network.\u201d\n\nExplanation & Visualization:\nWe treat one \u201csystem\u201d qubit (mode S) and a chain of N ancilla qubit pairs (Bell\u2010pair sources).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to meaningfully combine \u201cquantum tensor network\u201d and \u201cLindblad equation\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible experiment (no cavities/resonators, no forbidden state generation, focus on quantum networks/transformations).\n  \n  1) Collision\u2010model tensor network: implement a photonic collision model as a matrix\u2010product\u2010operator network. A single \u201csystem\u201d photon sequentially interacts (via beam splitters) with ancilla Bell pairs. Measuring those ancillas implements a small\u2010time Lindblad map. By stringing N steps you simulate Markovian open\u2010system evolution. Cross\u2013ancilla beam\u2010splitter links introduce memory (non-Markovian) and yield a process tensor MPS.\n  \n  2) Teleportation-based Lindblad channel: teleport an unknown input qubit through an entanglement-swapping network engineered (via choice of beam-splitter reflectivities and ancilla measurements) to realize a target Lindblad channel (e.g. amplitude damping or dephasing). This uses the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism\u2014prepare ancilla Bell pairs, swap, detect ancillas\u2014and herald the channel action on the output. By concatenating modules, one obtains discrete steps of L-driven evolution.\n  \n  3) Distributed dissipative tensor network: prepare multiple system qubits at different nodes. Use shared Bell\u2010pair resources and local entanglement swapping to implement coupling terms of a dissipative spin chain (e.g. boundary\u2010driven XX chain at Lindblad steady state). Nodes A\u2013B share ancillas; B\u2013C share ancillas, etc. Local joint measurements enact local jump operators. One measures correlations among system nodes to probe the dissipative phase diagram.\n\nStep 2: Novelty / obstacles  \n  1) Collision\u2010model MPS is new for pytheus (past experiments only generated pure entangled states or unitary gates). The only obstacle is mapping \u201csequential interactions + measurements\u201d into static linear\u2010optical network\u2014but Pytheus can optimize a static network with many ancillas.  \n  2) Teleportation channel simulation is conceptually simple but close to standard entanglement\u2010swapping recipes.  \n  3) Distributed dissipative chain is rich but resembles generating many Bell pairs plus joint measurements\u2014less clearly highlighting \u201ctensor network + Lindblad.\u201d\n\nStep 3: Pick the collision\u2010model MPS idea. It is both novel (first open\u2010system simulation via photonic tensor network modules) and feasible: uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, and no dynamic feedforward.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because nobody has proposed using a one\u2010dimensional photonic MPS of ancilla interactions to simulate a Lindblad master equation and explore both Markovian and non-Markovian regimes in a single linear\u2010optical network.\n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires designing a static linear\u2010optical network: one system input mode, N ancilla Bell\u2010pair sources, beam splitters between system and ancilla modes at each step, and photon detectors on ancillas. Pytheus can optimize connection patterns and beam\u2010splitter parameters to approximate the desired Lindblad generator for each discrete time step, and string these steps into an overall network.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is my proposal for the Expert:\n\nDescription:\n\u201cCollision\u2010model simulation of Lindblad open\u2010system dynamics via a photonic matrix\u2010product operator (MPO) network.\u201d\n\nExplanation & Visualization:\nWe treat one \u201csystem\u201d qubit (mode S) and a chain of N ancilla qubit pairs (Bell\u2010pair sources). Each step k implements a small\u2010time map \\(E_k = e^{L\\,\\delta t}\\) via a collision with ancilla k:\n\n   \u2022 Emit ancilla pair (modes A\u2096\u2081,A\u2096\u2082) in a Bell state via a probabilistic photon\u2010pair source.  \n   \u2022 Interfere mode S with A\u2096\u2081 on a tunable beam splitter (reflectivity set by \\(L\\delta t\\)).  \n   \u2022 Photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detection on A\u2096\u2081 and A\u2096\u2082 (ancilla detectors), heralding the jump/non-jump outcomes.  \n   \u2022 The remaining output mode continues as the new \u201csystem\u201d input to step k+1.\n\nGraphically (modes from top to bottom):\n\n  emit Bell pair (A\u2081\u2081\u2013A\u2081\u2082)   emit Bell pair (A\u2082\u2081\u2013A\u2082\u2082)   \u2026   emit Bell pair (A_N\u2081\u2013A_N\u2082)  \n          \u2502                        \u2502                         \u2502  \n         BS\u2081                      BS\u2082                    BS_N  \n          \u2502                        \u2502                         \u2502  \n  S\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25b6\u2013\u2013\u2534\u2013\u2013\u25b6\u2500\u25b6\u2014\u25b6 \u2026 \u2500\u2500\u25b6\u2500\u2500\u25b6 S_out     anc_det\u2081\u2081 anc_det\u2081\u2082  anc_det\u2082\u2081 anc_det\u2082\u2082 \u2026 anc_det_N\u2081 anc_det_N\u2082  \n\nWhere:\n  \u2013 \u201cBS\u2096\u201d is a beam splitter coupling system mode S with ancilla A\u2096\u2081.  \n  \u2013 \u201canc_det\u2096\u2081\u201d and \u201canc_det\u2096\u2082\u201d measure the two ancilla outputs.  \n  \u2013 Heralding patterns on ancillas realize the Kraus operators of \\(E_k\\).  \n  \u2013 By choosing reflectivities and heralding thresholds, the MPO built by these modules simulates the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u22c5\u03b4t.\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2013 Vary N, reflectivities, and inter-ancilla beam splitters to turn on/off memory (non-Markovian collision models).  \n  \u2013 Extend to multiple system modes (parallel MPO \u201cwires\u201d) for dissipative spin chains.  \n  \u2013 Probe fundamental questions: onset of non\u2010Markovianity, tensor\u2010network bond\u2010dimension vs. bath memory, steady\u2010state entanglement of dissipative networks.\n\nWhy it satisfies all constraints:\n  \u2013 It is a genuine quantum network (collision modules + measurements), not mere state generation.  \n  \u2013 It employs only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, beam splitters, and photon detectors\u2014exactly within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback; all heralding is post-selected.  \n  \u2013 It directly marries a tensor\u2010network picture (MPO/collision chain) with a Lindblad master-equation interpretation.  \n  \u2013 Provides a family of experiments parameterized by N, coupling strengths, and inter-ancilla links, ripe for further theoretical exploration.\n\nI believe Pytheus can find an explicit static circuit (choice of connections and beam\u2010splitter angles) to approximate a given L. This would yield a high\u2010impact Phys. Rev.
