Title: Collision‐Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open‐System Dynamics

Mini‐Abstract: We propose a static one‐dimensional photonic matrix‐product‐operator (MPO) network—built from probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number‐resolving detectors—to stroboscopically enact the small‐time Kraus maps E_k = e^{LΔt} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = NΔt. By heralding jump/non‐jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non‐Markovian) open‐system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.
