Title: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits

Mini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a “corner-mode” single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table—swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1⟩ state—without any dynamic feed-forward.
