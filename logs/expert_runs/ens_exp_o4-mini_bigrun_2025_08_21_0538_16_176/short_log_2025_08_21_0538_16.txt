Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The bilocality-test can be framed as a post-selected entanglement swapping: two SPDC pairs on modes [0,1] and [2,3], a static linear-optical BSM on modes 1–2 heralded by four ancilla detectors (4–7), and leaving modes 0 and 3 undetected (heralding_out=true). The four target patterns ['0000','0110','1001','1111'] capture the desired conditional correlations between modes 0 and 3. I will submit this configuration to pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network bilocality test reduces to heralded entanglement swapping—a post‐selected state generator that outputs a Bell state on modes 0–3 upon ancilla clicks. We cast it as a heralded state generation: two SPDC pairs feed a static BSM with four ancilla detectors, yielding the target Fock superposition ['1010','0101'] across four modes. Outgoing modes default to all, heralding_out=true ensures modes 0 and 3 remain available.
