}###Title: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor

Abstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[ρ_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test “HBT” heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.
