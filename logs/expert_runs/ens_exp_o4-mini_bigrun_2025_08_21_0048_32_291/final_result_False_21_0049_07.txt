}###Title: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics

Abstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state ρ_AB—directly enacting the Peres–Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.
