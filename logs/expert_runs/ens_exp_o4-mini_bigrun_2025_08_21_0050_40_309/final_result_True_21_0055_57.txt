}###Title: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6×6 beam-splitter–phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.
