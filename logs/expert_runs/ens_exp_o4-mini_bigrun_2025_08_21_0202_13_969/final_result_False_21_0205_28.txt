}###Title: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points

Abstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(α) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(α). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(α))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.
