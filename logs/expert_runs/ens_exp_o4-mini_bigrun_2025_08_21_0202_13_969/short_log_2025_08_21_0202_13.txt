SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration directly encodes the teleportation‐plus‐parity measurement network in a static interferometer, with a single‐photon input at mode 0, an SPDC ancilla pair heralded on detectors [3,4], and the out_node at mode 2. We’ll run Pytheus with these parameters to optimize the interferometer for the two‐click pattern mapping “100”↔“011” giving (1±W)/2.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint. I intended to use SPDC ancilla (num_anc) rather than single_emitters. Removing the single_emitters field resolves the conflict while still using SPDC sources for ancilla photons. We'll retry with that adjustment.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous failure arose because with 1 input and 2 SPDC photons there were an odd number of photons, preventing perfect matchings. We instead introduce three single-photon ancilla emitters so that total photons = 1 input + 3 ancilla = 4, an even number. We assign modes 0–1 for dual-rail input, modes 2–4 for ancilla emitters (detected), and modes 5–6 as dual-rail output. We specify the two target kets mapping |10⟩→|10⟩ and |01⟩→|01⟩ in a 7-mode string, with ancilla zeros and output rails occupied accordingly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempts failed due to odd photon numbers and mismatched string lengths. Let’s first target a static, heralded teleportation of a single‐rail qubit: one input mode (0), two ancilla SPDC photons, one output mode (1), heralding on both ancilla clicks, and enforce the mapping |0⟩→|0⟩, |1⟩→|1⟩ via target_quantum ["00","11"]. This is a valid even‐photon count, disjoint in_nodes/out_nodes, and number_resolving setup.
