}###Title: Static LOQC Realization of the Entanglement-Assisted (2,3) Quantum Secret Sharing Supermap

Abstract: We experimentally implement the EA(2,3) threshold secret-sharing supermap (target: EA_23_secret_share) as an entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code using only passive linear optics, one single-photon emitter, and two pre-shared Bell-pair sources.  By mixing the dealer’s unknown qubit with the Bell halves into three optical share modes via beam splitters and phase shifters, any two players can cooperatively route their modes through a static LOQC decoder and heraldedly reconstruct the dealer’s secret, while individual players gain no information.
