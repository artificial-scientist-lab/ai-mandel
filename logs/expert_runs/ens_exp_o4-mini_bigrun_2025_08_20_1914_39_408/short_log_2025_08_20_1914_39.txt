PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because specifying out_nodes=[0,3] refers to non‐existent node 3 for a two‐mode target. I’ll drop out_nodes (and in_nodes) and restrict removed_connections to valid mode indices [0,1]. This yields a valid two‐mode Bell state configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous restrictions prevented Bell-state generation. I’ll remove forbidden links and boost ancilla flexibility by using three SPDC ancilla photons and some edge attempts.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous configs failed due to mode indexing and odd total photons. To properly generate a dual-rail Bell pair (|00>+|11>) across two qubits (4 modes), we encode it as kets ["1010","0101"] (photons in modes 0&2 or 1&3), use two SPDC sources (num_anc=4 ancilla photons), and herald on ancilla clicks. No forbidden links for simplicity.
