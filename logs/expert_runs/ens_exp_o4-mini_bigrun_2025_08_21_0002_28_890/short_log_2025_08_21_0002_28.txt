Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The provided JSON contained invalid comments and an out‐of‐range ancilla detector index. I'll strip comments and correct the anc_detectors entry to valid mode indices, keeping the target intact.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mode-count mismatch arose because in_nodes, out_nodes, and anc_detectors didn't cover all 6 modes. I'll designate node 0 as the input, nodes 1–3 as the three ancilla detectors, and nodes 4–5 as the two output ports. This sets num_anc=3 and matches the six‐mode target_quantum.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Align the total number of modes in target_quantum (6) with the sum of in_nodes and out_nodes; drop ancilla sources for now (num_anc=0) and assign in_nodes=[0,1,2] and out_nodes=[3,4,5] so that 3+3=6 modes.
