Title  
“Cyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate”

Abstract  
We implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase φ, yielding deterministic teleportation and a φ-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.
