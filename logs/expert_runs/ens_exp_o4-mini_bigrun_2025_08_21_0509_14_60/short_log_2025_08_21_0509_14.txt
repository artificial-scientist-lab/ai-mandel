SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s suggestion specifies a static cycle‐graph teleportation protocol using four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources arranged in a ring, passive by‐product cancellation, and measurement‐controlled phase, with herald detectors at modes [0,1,2,3] and forbidden direct A–B connection. I will construct a Pytheus configuration that exactly matches this target, using two ancillary photons for repeater measurements, SPDC sources (no single emitters), detection on modes [0,1,2,3], and removed_connections [[0,3]].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to malformed node indexing and target strings. I’ve revised the config to use dual‐rail input [0,1], output [2,3], two SPDC ancillas, and proper 4‐digit target kets with complex amplitudes for Rₓ(π/2). The node union is now contiguous and the target lengths match.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target strings must include ancilla modes so that the total node set is contiguous from 0 to 5. We append the ancilla ‘11’ pattern to each 4-mode mapping, yielding 6-digit strings, and explicitly specify anc_detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I’ve corrected the node indexing and kets to dual-rail input [0,1] and output [2,3], with two SPDC ancillas detected (heralding_out=True), removed the A–B link, and encoded the π/2 phase as a polar amplitude.
