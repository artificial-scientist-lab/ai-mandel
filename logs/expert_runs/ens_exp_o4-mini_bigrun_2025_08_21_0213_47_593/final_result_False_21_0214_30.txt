}###Title: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J₁–J₂ Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer

Abstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J₁ and J₂ couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00⟩+|11⟩ between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J₂/J₁, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J₁–J₂ model.
