Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now correctly identifies the four incoming modes (two from each SPDC source), designates modes 0 and 3 as the unmeasured outputs (qubits A and D), uses two ancilla detections (b and c) in a passive HOM+Bell interferometer, forbids any source directly coupling A and D, and heralds on the ancilla clicks. I'll run this with pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. For a state generation task, we leave in_nodes empty and specify the two output modes [0,3] as out_nodes, so they remain unmeasured. Ancilla photons (modes 1 and 2) are detected (heralding_out=true). Removed_connections is unnecessary since each SPDC source only feeds one output.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to specify only the two output modes [0,1] for the Bell pair, declare two ancilla detectors on modes [2,3], and leave in_nodes empty so the total node set [0,1] is contiguous. We enforce heralded filtering, use two ancilla photons, and forbid direct SPDC between outputs.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network needs more ancilla photons for HOM filtering. Use three SPDC pair sources (num_pre=3) to generate six photons: two as outputs (modes 0,1) and four as heralding ancillas (modes 2–5). Keep out_nodes=[0,1], anc_detectors=[2,3,4,5], heralding_out=true, and drop additional restrictions.
