Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Double‐Controlled Four‐Way Entanglement Router requires two control qubits (from single‐photon emitters) and four SPDC pair sources providing eight ancilla photons. We forbid any single SPDC source from supplying both a control and a leaf detector via removed_connections, and we specify the target entangled superposition mapping the two control‐qubit bits to exactly one of four leaf photons. This config remains true to the research suggestion without simplifying the target.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates control qubits cannot be both in_nodes and single_emitters. Control photons are external inputs, so they belong only in in_nodes; single_emitters must list only ancilla emitters. I’ll remove the control indices from single_emitters and leave it empty. I’ll also set in_nodes empty so that Pytheus treats all photons (controls and leaves) as outputs, matching the network‐creation style used in previous multi‐party ES examples.
