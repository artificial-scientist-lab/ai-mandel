Title:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router

Abstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.
