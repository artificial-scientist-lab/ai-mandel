Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Accept the proposed static heralded teleportation configuration and hand it off to Pytheus for optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because I listed input nodes in both in_nodes and single_emitters, but these sets must be disjoint. I'll move the single-photon emitters for ancilla to higher numbered modes (6,7,8) so they no longer overlap with the input or output nodes and retry.
