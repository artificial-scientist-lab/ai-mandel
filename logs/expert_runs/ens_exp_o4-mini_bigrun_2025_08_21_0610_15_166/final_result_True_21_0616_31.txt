Mini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains—one Markovian and one non-Markovian—before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target state to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.
