Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration represents a 4-qubit identity transformation (data qubits 0–3), with 8 ancilla modes (4–11) measured to extract all four toric code syndromes in one pass. We enforce no common pair-sources among data qubits via removed_connections and use probabilistic Bell pairs for ancillas. The JSON below matches the idea exactly.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. To fix this, I'll assign the data outputs to distinct mode indices [4,5,6,7] and keep data inputs at [0–3]. The 8 ancillas occupy modes beyond 7 implicitly via SPDC resources, and we forbid any direct data–data pair sources via removed_connections.
