}###Title: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2×2 Toric Code Patch

Abstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2×2 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0–3. Eight ancilla modes—entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources—are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target state, all within Pytheus’s probabilistic linear-optical framework.
