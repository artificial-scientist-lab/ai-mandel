Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modifications provide a complete Pytheus-ready configuration matching the one-shot 4-body parity measurement idea. I will pass this config directly to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that the sum of in_nodes and out_nodes must equal the number of detector modes in target_quantum. For a pure measurement config, we only include the ancilla modes as in_nodes and leave out_nodes empty. I’ll remove out_nodes and heralding_out to match measurement examples.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates node numbering must be contiguous starting at 0 and include only the measurement modes. For a pure measurement, we list the four ancilla detection modes as in_nodes [0,1,2,3], leave out_nodes empty, set num_anc=4, and target_quantum kets of length 4. This matches measurement examples.
