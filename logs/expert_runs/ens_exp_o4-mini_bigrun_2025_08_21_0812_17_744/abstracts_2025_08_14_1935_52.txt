Title: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront‐Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers

Abstract: We propose a fully static four‐node cycle experiment (A–B–C–D–A) that employs four independent entangled photon‐pair sources and two 4×4 multiport Bell–state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single‐photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target “Bell_test_stat” square‐network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.
