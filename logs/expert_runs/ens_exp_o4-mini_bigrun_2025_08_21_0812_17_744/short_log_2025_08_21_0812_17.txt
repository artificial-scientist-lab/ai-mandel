Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration is set to design two simultaneous 4×4 Bell analyzers at nodes B and D, mapping four incoming photons plus two ancillas to eight outputs. We'll hand this off to Pytheus for static linear-optical optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The in/out overlap error arises because input and output node indices intersect. I’ll assign input nodes to new high indices (8–11) disjoint from outputs (0–7) and retry.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The combined dual-analyzer config had in_nodes/out_nodes mismatches. I'll simplify to optimize a single 4×4 Bell‐state analyzer module (wavefront-shaped nanophotonic resonator) at one node with two ancillas. This uses 2 input photons + 2 ancillas to 4 output modes, discriminating the four Bell states.
