SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed configuration correctly encodes a post-selected Bell-state projection module with 4 loop iterations to stand for the Floquet-walk layers, uses two ancilla photons for a linear‐optical Bell measurement, and matches the researcher’s target_quantum of ["00","11"]. It stays true to the suggestion and is ready to run.
