Title: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange

Abstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c⟩→|b,c,a⟩ via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement–induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.
