Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to correct the mode indexing so that target_quantum strings only refer to the 3 input and 3 output modes. We set out_nodes to [3,4,5], list ancilla detectors at modes 6–11, and remove single SPDC links between inputs.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Remove single_emitters to avoid overlap with in_nodes, since ancilla photons come from SPDC.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The errors indicate that removed_connections should only list detector nodes, and single_emitters must be disjoint from in_nodes. We don’t need single_emitters because ancillas are from SPDC pair sources; we can leave removed_connections empty. We specify the ancilla detectors explicitly.
