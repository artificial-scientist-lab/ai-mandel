Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now correctly encodes two incoming Bell pairs, four ancilla heralds, the no-crossing restrictions, and the target swapped two-qubit Bell measurement. I'll run Pytheus with this final config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because input and output nodes overlapped. I’ll assign outputs to new nodes (4,5) and ancilla detectors to nodes (6–9), ensuring disjoint sets.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mapping error comes from specifying explicit in/out nodes. Instead of a transformation, we treat this as a measurement‐scheme (like ES_246), with no in/out nodes and target_quantum describing the two‐qubit Bell patterns. We count all detection clicks (4 ancilla heralds + 2 Bell‐measurement detectors) via num_anc=6.
