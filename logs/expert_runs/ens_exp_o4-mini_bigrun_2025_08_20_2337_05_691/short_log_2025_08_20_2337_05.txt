Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration accurately captures the 2×2 percolation network, with eight input modes from four pair sources, two Bell swaps at modes (1,2) and (5,6) heralded by ancilla detectors (8–11), and output nodes [0,4] held unmeasured until key generation. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint. Since all photons are generated by SPDC sources, no external inputs exist, so in_nodes should be empty. Retain out_nodes for the two surviving corner modes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The contiguity error means we must declare the input modes for the SPDC sources so that the union of in_nodes, out_nodes, and anc_detectors covers all node indices from 0 to 11. We'll set in_nodes to [1,2,3,5,6,7] (the non-output SPDC modes), out_nodes remains [0,4], and anc_detectors [8–11].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The contiguity error can be avoided by modeling edge sources as single-photon emitters on modes 0–7 and using four ancilla detectors (8–11) for the two BSMs, leaving modes 0 and 4 as the surviving output qubits.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The contiguity and node-disjointness requirements force me to explicitly label the eight SPDC‐produced photons as “in_nodes,” then carve out the two surviving corner photons as “out_nodes,” leaving the remaining six SPDC photons as inputs and the four BSM ancilla detectors separate. This makes in_nodes=[1,2,3,5,6,7], out_nodes=[0,4], single_emitters=[]; union of in_nodes+out_nodes covers 0–7; anc_detectors= [8,9,10,11]. The target kets “00” and “11” now length-2 matching len(out_nodes). Attempting one last run.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch arose from confusing SPDC ancillas with inputs/outputs. Instead model eight ancilla photons (from four pair sources) as nodes 0–7, measured by anc_detectors, and the two surviving corner modes as outputs at nodes 8 and 9. No in_nodes needed. This satisfies contiguity and target length.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify node assignment: only the two output modes A–C enter the target kets (length 2), so set in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1], num_anc=8 for the four SPDC sources, heralding_out=true to consume all ancilla via clicks, and leave anc_detectors empty.
