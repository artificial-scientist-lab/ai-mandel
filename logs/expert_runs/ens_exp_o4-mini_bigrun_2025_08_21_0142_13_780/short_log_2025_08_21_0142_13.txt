SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration accurately encodes two single-photon inputs (modes 0,1) from Alice and Bob, two SPDC-sourced ancilla photons, and post-selected single-photon outputs in modes 2 (parity=0) and 3 (parity=1). The target_quantum strings map (x,y)→click in the correct detector, and we use number-resolving detection. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint. Alice and Bob’s photons are incoming, not single_emitters. Ancilla photons come from SPDC (num_anc), so we clear single_emitters.
