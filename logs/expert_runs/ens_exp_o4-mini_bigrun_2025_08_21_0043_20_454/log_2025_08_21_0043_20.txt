    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "output": "Thought: The proposed hybrid DV\u2013CV swap relies on a genuine two-mode squeezed (Gaussian) resource with vacuum-plus-pair components, which Pytheus cannot model because it only supports discrete single-photon pair (SPDC) sources that always emit exactly one photon per branch. Without access to the vacuum term in the CV channel, Pytheus cannot produce the |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 component of the target state. Therefore this hybrid entanglement\u2010swap task cannot be realized within Pytheus\u2019s purely discrete-photon framework.  \n\nFinal Answer: It is not possible to implement the suggested hybrid DV/CV entanglement swapping in Pytheus, since Pytheus lacks support for two-mode squeezers (Gaussian vacuum contributions) and thus cannot generate the vacuum term needed for the |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 component of the target state."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:\n  \u201cEntanglement Swapping Across Discrete and Continuous-Variable Channels\u201d\n\nExplanation:\n  We propose a three-node hybrid quantum network that \u201cswaps\u201d entanglement between a discrete-variable qubit channel and a continuous-variable (Gaussian) channel, producing at the far ends a novel hybrid entangled state (a qubit entangled with a qumode).  This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This pure network transformation combines single-photon pair sources, two-mode squeezers, linear optics, and number-resolving detection only\u2014perfectly within Pytheus\u2019s remit.\n\nNetwork sketch (modes flow top\u2192bottom):\n  1) Discrete-variable (DV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A probabilistic single-photon pair source (SPDC) emits one photon to Party A (mode A) and one to the central swapper Party B (mode B\u2081).  \n  2) Continuous-variable (CV) entanglement source:\n     \u2013 A two-mode squeezer (Gaussian EPR source) emits one half (mode B\u2082) to Party B and the other half (mode C) to Party C.  In the truncated Fock basis {0,1}, this resource is |00\u27e9+\u03bb|11\u27e9.  \n  3) Hybrid Bell-swap at Party B:\n     \u2013 Modes B\u2081 (DV) and B\u2082 (CV) are interfered on a beam splitter.  \n     \u2013 Both output ports are sent to number-resolving detectors D\u2081 and D\u2082.  \n     \u2013 A joint detection event \u201cD\u2081=1 photon & D\u2082=1 photon\u201d projects the two input modes onto a hybrid Bell-like state, heralding the swap.  \n  4) Post-selected entanglement:\n     \u2013 Conditioned on D\u2081=D\u2082=1, the remaining modes A and C collapse into the hybrid entangled state  \n       |\u03c8\u27e9\u208dA,C\u208e \u221d |0\u27e9\u2090|0\u27e9\ud835\udcd2 +  |1\u27e9\u2090|1\u27e9\ud835\udcd2  \n       (up to known phases), i.e. a qubit\u2013qumode entangled state.\n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2013 It is the first network-level demonstration of entanglement swapping bridging discrete photonic qubits and continuous Gaussian modes.  \n  \u2013 Opens fundamental studies of hybrid steering, entanglement capacity across DV/CV interfaces, and robustness under loss.  \n  \u2013 Naturally extends to multi-swap chains (DV\u2192CV\u2192DV\u2192CV\u2026), higher Fock-level truncations (|00\u27e9+|22\u27e9, etc.), or multi-party hybrid GHZ/cluster distributions.  \n  \u2013 Utilizes only Pytheus-compatible elements: probabilistic pair sources (single-photon emitters, two-mode squeezers), beam splitters & phases, static number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No cavities, feedback loops, or hyper-entanglement.\n\nTarget (abstract for Pytheus):\n  \u2013 A post-selected mapping that, upon the D\u2081=D\u2082=1 detection pattern, yields the two-mode target amplitudes {\u201800\u2019, \u201811\u2019} between modes A and C.  \n  \u2013 Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter ratios, source amplitudes, and detector placements to maximize heralding probability and fidelity of the hybrid entangled state.\n\nThis experiment is a truly new kind of quantum network task\u2014hybrid entanglement swapping\u2014merging the ideas of CV teleportation (Gaussian entangled resources) with discrete-variable photonic qubits, and will seed a family of related hybrid network protocols.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I will set up a Pytheus configuration for the hybrid DV\u2013CV entanglement swapping.

If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.\nThis error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again."
