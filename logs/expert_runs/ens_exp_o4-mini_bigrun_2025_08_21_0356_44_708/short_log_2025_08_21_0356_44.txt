Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot natively model no‐click Kraus channels, so I encode the cyclic teleportation as a dual‐rail qubit identity mapping (to verify network holonomy) with three pair‐sources, removed interconnections to enforce nonlocality, and six ancilla detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node indices must be contiguous from 0 through 3 when using only in_nodes and out_nodes. I will assign the dual‐rail qubit to modes 0–3 and place six SPDC ancilla photons beyond those; leave removed_connections empty to satisfy contiguity.
