}###Title: Non-Abelian Holonomy via a Three-Node Teleportation Cycle

Abstract: We realize the target “Three-Node Teleportation Cycle with Non-Abelian Measurement-Induced Holonomy” by routing an unknown single-rail photonic qubit through nodes A→B→C→A via three distinct, non-commuting Lindblad dissipation channels K₀¹, K₀², K₀³—each implemented with probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and passive Bell swaps. The composite Kraus map K₀³K₀²K₀¹ imprints a genuinely non-unitary, non-Abelian holonomic rotation on the qubit’s Bloch sphere that cannot be decomposed into mere phase shifts or attenuation, thereby demonstrating a new class of network-induced quantum holonomies.
