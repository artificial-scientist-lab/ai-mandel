SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion specifies using four ancilla photons from two Bell-pair (SPDC) sources and a 6-mode target with kets `"001000"`, `"010000"`, `"100000"`; to remain true to the researcher’s target, I will list exactly those three 6‐digit strings in `target_quantum`, set `num_anc` to 4, leave `single_emitters` empty (so ancilla come from SPDC), enable PNR detection, and configure the rest as a measurement network.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because measurement targets must match only the incoming modes. I will redefine the W-state analyzer target with 3-digit strings for inputs.
