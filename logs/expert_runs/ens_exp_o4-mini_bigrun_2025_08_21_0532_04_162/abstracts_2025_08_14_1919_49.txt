Title:
Heralded Linear‐Optical 1→2 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement

Mini-Abstract:
We propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1→2 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop “resonators.” Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong–Ou–Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.
