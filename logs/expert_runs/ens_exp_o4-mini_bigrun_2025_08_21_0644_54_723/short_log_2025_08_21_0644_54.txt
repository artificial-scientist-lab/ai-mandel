Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Submitting the Pytheus configuration for the topological SSH-phase entanglement‐swapping with a single-bond defect to find a heralded end-to-end Bell pair between modes 0 and 5.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the configuration to make in_nodes empty (since all photons originate from probabilistic pair sources) and specify out_nodes as [0,5] (the two end modes) to be kept as the output Bell pair. Add anc_detectors [1,2,3,4] for heralding, ensuring in_nodes and out_nodes are disjoint.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Ensure node continuity by treating ancilla modes as single photon emitters. Set single_emitters=[1,2,3,4], out_nodes=[0,5], in_nodes=[], so nodes 0–5 covered, heralding_out true for ancilla detection.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Define ancilla detection modes explicitly with anc_detectors=[1,2,3,4] and out_nodes=[0,5], remove in_nodes and single_emitters so that removal_connections applies only to detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify to a pure SPDC‐based entanglement‐swapping generation, dropping explicit in_nodes/out_nodes/single_emitters/anc_detectors so Pytheus uses only pair sources and detectors. Keep removal_connections to forbid weak bonds plus defect across modes [0–5].
