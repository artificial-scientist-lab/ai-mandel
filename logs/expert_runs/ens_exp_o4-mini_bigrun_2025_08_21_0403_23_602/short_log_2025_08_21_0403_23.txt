Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will configure Pytheus to search for a minimal‐depth linear‐optics “ansatz” network that, with one ancilla photon, performs an entanglement‐swapping Bell‐measurement on modes B₁,B₂ and heralds a |00>+|11> state on A–C. I’ll enforce that A and C detectors share no common SPDC source via removed_connections and optimize fidelity in the Fock basis.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial error was due to using fockfid with string‐based target quantum. I need to switch to count‐rate loss_func (“cr”) and use discrete-variable target_quantum ["00","11"]. I’ll configure Pytheus accordingly, include two ancilla photons to allow nontrivial ansatz, and forbid common sources between detectors 0 and 1 with removed_connections.
