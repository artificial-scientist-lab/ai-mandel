    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc').

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc').

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences.

Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc').

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc').

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201coptical phase estimation\u201d with \u201cmode-squeezed state\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state generation):\n    a) A ring of two-mode squeezed vacua with sequential entanglement swaps to create a 3-node interferometer whose joint detection statistics encode all three pairwise phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.  \n    b) Teleport-and-measure: encode an unknown phase \u03c6 on a single-photon dual-rail qubit at A, then teleport it via two successive swaps through squeezed-vacuum links A\u2013B and B\u2013C so that C holds the phase. A final interferometric measurement then estimates \u03c6.  \n    c) Distributed homodyne network: send squeezed vacua from two SPDC sources into nodes A and B; nodes imprint local phases \u03c6A, \u03c6B; then a Bell measurement at B teleports a joint squeezed probe to A; A\u2019s final photon-number measurement extracts \u03c6A+\u03c6B.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    a) Novel: no previous Pytheus design builds a ring-swapped multi-mode interferometer. Uses only SPDC, linear optics, Bell swaps, photon counters.  \n    b) Essentially textbook teleportation + phase readout\u2014too close to known teleportation experiments.  \n    c) Single-phase readout\u2014no multi-phase novelty.  \n  Step 3: Pick (a): the ring-swapped tri-mode interferometer.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment forms a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezed vacua to implement a distributed 3-mode interferometer that simultaneously senses all three relative phases.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: \n    \u2022 Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (two-mode squeezers), linear optics (BS + phase shifters), post-selected Bell measurements at the central node, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors.  \n    \u2022 It is a pure measurement/transformation network: the goal is not to generate a static state but to perform a multi-phase estimation operation whose click statistics directly encode the three phase differences. Pytheus can optimize the swap order and final multiport to realize the desired joint probability distributions.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposal:\n\n\u201cRing-Swapped Tri-Mode Interferometric Phase Network\u201d\n\n1) Resources & Layout  \n   \u2022 Three two-mode squeezed-vacuum sources (SPDC): link A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 One central node X that receives one arm from each SPDC source.  \n   \u2022 Parties A, B, C each hold the remaining arms locally.\n\n2) Entanglement-Swap Stage  \n   \u2022 At X perform three Bell-measurements in ring order (swap AB, then BC, then CA).  \n   \u2022 Post-selection on successful swaps yields an effective three-mode squeezed resource shared by A, B, C\u2014*but we do not aim to generate a standalone state*, we only use this resource to connect phases.\n\n3) Phase Encoding  \n   \u2022 Each party applies an unknown phase shift \u03c6A, \u03c6B, \u03c6C to its local mode.\n\n4) Final Interferometric Measurement  \n   \u2022 The three modes are fed into a bespoke 3\u00d73 linear-optics multiport (to be found by Pytheus).  \n   \u2022 Outputs are recorded by photon-number\u2013resolving detectors at A, B, C.\n\n5) Target Functionality (Transformation/Measurement)  \n   \u2022 The joint detection probabilities P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) must exhibit interference fringes \u221dcos(\u03c6i\u2212\u03c6j) for each pair (i,j).  \n   \u2022 Equivalently, the mapping from input phases to click-pattern probabilities realizes simultaneous estimation of the two independent phases out of {\u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A}.\n\nGeneralizations & Extensions  \n   \u2022 N-node ring: N SPDC links + N swaps \u2192 N-mode interferometer estimating N\u22121 independent phases with Heisenberg scaling in total squeezing.  \n   \u2022 Adaptive multiport at readout: replace fixed 3\u00d73 mixer by an optimized POVM network (found by Pytheus) to saturate the multi-parameter Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.  \n   \u2022 Hybrid resources: swap in heralded single-photon emitters on some edges to compare yield vs. pure SPDC resources.\n\nWhy This Is Novel  \n   \u2013 It is not a static state-generation task; it is a *network-and-measurement* protocol.  \n   \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has woven a closed ring of entanglement swaps on two-mode squeezers into a multi-mode interferometric sensor.  \n   \u2013 Enables simultaneous, distributed sensing of multiple relative phases in a single optical network.\n\nWhy Feasible in Pytheus  \n   \u2013 SPDC sources are modelled as probabilistic photon-pair emitters.  \n   \u2013 Bell-measurements and linear-optics multiports are built from beam splitters and phase shifters.  \n   \u2013 Detectors are photon-number resolving.  \n   \u2013 All elements are within Pytheus\u2019s current capabilities\u2014no cavities, no feedback control, no hyper-entanglement assumptions.  \n   \u2013 Pytheus can optimize both the arrangement of swaps and the final multiport to match the target click-pattern interference fringes.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The researcher\u2019s goal is to build a ring\u2010swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase\u2010estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3\u00d73 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns \u201c100111\u201d,\u201c010111\u201d,\u201c001111\u201d (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the \u2018lff\u2019 (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.

If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.\nThis error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function.
