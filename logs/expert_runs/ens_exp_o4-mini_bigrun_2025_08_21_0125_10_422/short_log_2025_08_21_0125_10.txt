Expert (o4-mini): Thought:
The suggested JSON had mismatched mode labels and missing key fields for ancilla detection. To faithfully encode the CZ holonomic loop, we keep modes 0,1 as inputs; modes 2–5 as ancilla SPDC pairs; modes 6–9 as heralding detectors, post‐selecting the Berry‐phase imprint. We set `target_quantum` to ['0000','0101','1010','1111'] with amplitudes [1,1,1,–1], `in_nodes` [0,1], `out_nodes` [2,3], `num_anc` 4, and `heralding_out` true. No forbidden connections are needed since inputs come from single emitters. All other fields follow our fidelity‐driven defaults.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that 'tries_per_edge' is required. I will add `"tries_per_edge": 5` to the configuration, keeping all other parameters unchanged to faithfully represent the holonomic CZ gate via a Berry-phase loop.
