SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested config captures the static 4-mode Bell-analyzer exactly as specified—post-selecting on single-click patterns “1000”, “0100”, “0010”, “0001” with one single-photon ancilla at mode 2, four detectors, and count-rate loss. I will invoke Pytheus with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that the ancilla emitter node (2) was incorrectly listed in in_nodes. We only need to list the two qubit inputs as in_nodes, and define the ancilla via single_emitters. I'll remove 2 and 3 from in_nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The in_nodes must list all four modes (two qubit inputs, the ancilla input, and the vacuum reference) so that target_quantum strings of length 4 match in_nodes length. Single_emitters cannot overlap with in_nodes, so we must drop the single_emitters entry—ancilla will be treated as a probabilistic input. This preserves the measurement target (single-click patterns) and detection events.
