Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects Option A, embedding a (3,1) entanglement‐assisted code around a teleportation channel. We specify dual‐rail input on modes 0–1, dual‐rail output on modes 8–9, eight ancilla photons from four SPDC sources, and forbid any direct source between input and output with removed_connections. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (10) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch arose because target_quantum strings must cover all nodes: input (2) + ancillas (8) + outputs (2) =12. I’ll extend the strings accordingly and set out_nodes to [10,11] so lengths align.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target should map the two dual-rail input modes to the two dual-rail output modes. For discrete-variable fidelity loss (‘fid’), target_quantum strings length = in_nodes + out_nodes = 4. The ancilla modes are created implicitly by SPDC sources and are not in the target strings. We forbid any SPDC source directly connecting input to output with removed_connections.
