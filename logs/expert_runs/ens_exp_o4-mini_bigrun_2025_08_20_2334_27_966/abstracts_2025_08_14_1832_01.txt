Title: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip

Mini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon “address” qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.
