Photonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  

Abstract:  
We demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade–inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.
