Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures six-mode input with four ancilla detectors performing a 4-photon GHZ projection on modes 1–4, heralding an entangled Bell pair on modes 0 and 5. Sources are restricted to pairs (0,1), (2,3), (4,5) via removed_connections. Calling Pytheus to find the optimal passive interferometer.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 0 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mapping requires a gate‐like post‐selection: six incoming photons (positions 0–5) and two outgoing (positions 6–7). We encode only the two valid input patterns (“000000” and “111111”) mapping to outputs “00” and “11” to project the middle four photons in GHZ basis and herald A–D entanglement. Ancilla detections are the four middle modes, heralding_out=true.
