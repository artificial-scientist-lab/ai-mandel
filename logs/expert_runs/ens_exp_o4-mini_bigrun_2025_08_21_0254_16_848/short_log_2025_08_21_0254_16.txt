SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion requires a static linear-optical network that uses two single-photon emitters (nodes 0,1) as orthogonal-polarization control qubits, four SPDC pair sources creating eight ancilla photons, and ancilla detectors (nodes 10–17) to herald one of four Bell‐swap branches in coherent superposition. We need to forbid direct SPDC sources linking control emitters to wrong SPDC halves, so we include the specified removed_connections. We represent the goal as a 4-dimensional Bell‐swap network (analogous to Example ES_246), targeting a superposed four-level entanglement between control rails and leaf rails: target_quantum ["00","11","22","33"]. This matches the researcher’s design.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint. By default out_nodes was null, causing a conflict check to fail. I will explicitly set out_nodes to an empty list (so it’s disjoint from single_emitters) and remove invalid keys like “pair_sources” and “anc_detectors” so the config matches Pytheus’s schema and still encodes our four-way entanglement router target as a 4-dimensional Bell-state (the router primitive).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because out_nodes was implicitly including the single_emitter nodes. To fix this, I’ll explicitly assign the two output modes (the pair-entangled qudits) to nodes 2 and 3, ensuring they’re disjoint from the control emitters at 0 and 1. I’ll also replace the overly specific removed_connections with the single constraint forbidding any single source from linking both outputs, [[2,3]]. This matches the 4-dimensional Bell‐swap target and preserves the double‐control routing structure.
