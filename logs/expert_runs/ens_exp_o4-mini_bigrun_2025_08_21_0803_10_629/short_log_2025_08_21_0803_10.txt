Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to build a measurement‐type Pytheus config for a passive 4D Bell‐state analyzer: two ququart inputs plus two ancilla photons, ten total modes, number‐resolving detectors, post‐selected discrimination of four Bell states (|00>,|11>,|22>,|33>). I'll treat all photons as coming from single‐photon emitters (positions 0,1 for the ququarts; 8,9 for the ancillas), leave in_nodes empty, use num_anc=10 (detectors), and specify target_quantum=["00","11","22","33"] with loss_func="cr".

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the measurement configuration: explicitly list the 8 ququart input modes in in_nodes, remove single_emitters entirely to avoid overlap with (empty) out_nodes, keep num_anc=10 (total detectors), target_quantum for 4-dim Bell states, and other measurement parameters.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement scheme is a Bell‐state analyzer for one 4D symmetric Bell state |Φ₀⟩ = |00⟩+|11⟩+|22⟩+|33⟩ on two ququarts, using two ancilla photons in a 10×10 metasurface interferometer with 10 number‐resolving detectors. We set num_anc to 10 (detectors), in_nodes to [0,1] (two input photons), target_quantum to the four terms, and other parameters as in GHZ examples.
