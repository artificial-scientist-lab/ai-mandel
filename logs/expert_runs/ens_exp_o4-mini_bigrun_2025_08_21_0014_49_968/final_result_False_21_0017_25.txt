}###Title: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference ΔN = NA – ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas

Mini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference ΔN = NA – ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target ΔN without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.
