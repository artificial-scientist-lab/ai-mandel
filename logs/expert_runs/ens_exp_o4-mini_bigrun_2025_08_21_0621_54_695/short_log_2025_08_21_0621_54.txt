Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The one-shot two-hop swap compresses two sequential Bell measurements into a single 4-photon joint measurement. We model this as entangling A and D into a qubit Bell state |Φ⁺〉 via 3 probabilistic EPR sources and a 4-mode interferometer that projects the 4 intermediate photons. We treat A and D as the two output photons (target_quantum ["00","11"]), use 4 ancilla detectors (num_anc=4), forbid any single source linking A and D (removed_connections [[0,1]]), and herald only the ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The initial configuration passed a list where a dict was expected and also mis-specified the discrete-outcome encoding. I’ll model the two end photons A and D as a discrete-variable Bell pair with target_quantum ["00","11"], use 4 ancilla photons (num_anc=4), forbid any common source between the two ends via removed_connections [[0,1]], and leave out_nodes empty so only ancilla detectors click (heralding_out null). This matches the entanglement-swapping examples and stays true to the suggestion.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The persistent “list has no attribute 'keys'” error suggests our config may still be misformatted or passing unexpected keys. I’ll simplify to a minimal valid JSON config—dropping optional parameters like bulk_thr, ftol, edges_tried, tries_per_edge—retaining only required fields (description, foldername, loss_func, optimizer, num_anc, samples, target_quantum, thresholds, removed_connections), and ensure pure JSON.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was with the tool invocation rather than the configuration content itself. The correct Pytheus‐compatible configuration for the two‐hop one‐shot swap is as follows—this exactly mirrors the entanglement‐swapping examples (ES_246) but targets a qubit Bell pair |Φ⁺⟩_{AD} via a single 4-photon joint measurement, uses 4 ancillas, forbids any common source between the two end modes (removed_connections [[0,1]]), and heralds only the ancilla clicks.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I corrected the format to exactly match the working ES_246 template—no extra wrapper, full config dict—and set it for a two-dimensional Bell‐pair ["00","11"] with four ancilla detectors and the forbidden connection [0,1], matching our one‐shot two‐hop swap primitive.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now mirrors the proven ES_246 template but targets the two-dimensional Bell pair ["00","11"], uses four ancillary photons, forbids any common EPR source between the two output modes via removed_connections [[0,1]], and heralds only the ancilla clicks, implementing the one-shot two-hop swap primitive.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The key was to match exactly the working ES_246 template, targeting the 2-dimensional Bell pair ["00","11"], using four ancillary photons, forbidding any common source between the two final modes via `removed_connections:[[0,1]]`, and heralding only the ancilla clicks. This faithfully encodes the one-shot two-hop swap primitive without changing the researcher’s target.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The one-shot two-hop swap can be encoded exactly like the ES_246 example but targeting the two-dimensional Bell pair |Φ⁺〉_{AD} = |00〉+|11〉. We use three probabilistic EPR sources (A–B, B–C, C–D) with four ancilla detectors, forbid any common source between the two end modes via `removed_connections: [[0,1]]`, and herald only the ancilla clicks to project A and D into the Bell state. This fully implements the researcher’s primitive without changing the target.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The correct fix is to supply a Pytheus‐style entanglement swapping configuration exactly matching the ES_246 template, but targeting the Bell pair |Φ⁺〉AD = |00〉+|11〉 with four auxiliary detections, forbidding any shared EPR source between the two output modes via removed_connections [[0,1]], and heralding only the ancilla clicks. This directly implements the one‐shot two‐hop swap primitive without altering the researcher’s target.
