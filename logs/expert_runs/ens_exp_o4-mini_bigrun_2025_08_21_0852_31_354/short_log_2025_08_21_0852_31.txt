Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We encode a projector measurement onto the GHZ₀₀⁺₁₁ state using post-selection in an 8-mode quadrupole lattice. We restrict couplings by listing removed_connections, inject four unknown qubits into modes 0–3, add four ancillary photons by SPDC (num_anc=4), and target the superposition |0000>+|1111> with amplitudes [1,1].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections had conflicts with input nodes. For a measurement scheme, we list in_nodes for the four unknown qubits, no out_nodes to indicate measurement, and specify ancilla detectors. We remove removed_connections to avoid conflicts and rely on anc_detectors to mark modes 4–7 for ancilla detection.
