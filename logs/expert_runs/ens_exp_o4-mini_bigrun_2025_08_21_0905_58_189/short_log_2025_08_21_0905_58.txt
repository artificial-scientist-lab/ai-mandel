PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stemmed from noncontiguous node indices. For a single-qubit Pauli-X teleporter loop, we need two input modes and two output modes, plus eight ancilla modes. We adjust in_nodes to [0,1], out_nodes to [2,3], and express target_quantum as four-digit strings ["1001","0110"]. We drop removed_connections for now to ensure valid node numbering.
