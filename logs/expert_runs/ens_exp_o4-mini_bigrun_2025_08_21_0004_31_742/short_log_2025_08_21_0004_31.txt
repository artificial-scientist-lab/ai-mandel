Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will construct a Pytheus configuration that implements a single‐step collective amplitude–damping channel for two qubits by mapping its Choi vector into a static entanglement‐swapping network. I encode the Choi vector terms as kets on the system inputs, system outputs, and two ancilla outcome bits, forbid any direct connection from inputs to outputs (removed_connections), and set up two ancilla Bell‐measurements (num_anc=2) to herald the Kraus outcomes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because Pytheus needs an explicit ancilla‐detector node list to match the total number of modes implied by the target.  I will add one ancilla photon (num_anc=1), declare its detector at node 4, and encode both the no‐jump (ancilla=0) and jump (ancilla=1) branches of the two‐qubit collective amplitude‐damping Kraus map as 5‐digit discrete‐variable kets on (in₁,in₂,out₁,out₂,ancilla).  I’ll forbid any direct source from inputs to outputs via removed_connections and herald only the ancilla detector click.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch errors arose because Pytheus expects the length of each target string to equal the total number of undetected (out_nodes) plus detected (if heralding_out=False) modes. By switching to a heralded scheme (heralding_out=true), only the system‐output modes remain undetected, so target strings should be 4‐digits long (2 in + 2 out). I’ll declare 4 ancilla photons (num_anc=4) to implement the two Bell measurements, set heralding_out=true so only modes 2,3 are “outs,” and supply a 4‐term Choi‐isometry target (identity plus collective jump) in 4‐digit format with equal amplitudes for simplicity.
