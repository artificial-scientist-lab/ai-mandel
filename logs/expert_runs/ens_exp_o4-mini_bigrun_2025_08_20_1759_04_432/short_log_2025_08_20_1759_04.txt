SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested skeleton uses single_emitters incorrectly for SPDC sources; adjust to use probabilistic photon-pair sources with four ancilla photons, define measurement modes as in_nodes, data modes as out_nodes, and target click patterns corresponding to D0&D2 and D1&D3.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose from mismatched in/out nodes versus target patterns. For a measurement network we should treat the ancilla modes as inputs (in_nodes) and leave out_nodes empty since data photons exit unmeasured. The target_quantum patterns should be the two 4-bit click patterns “1010” and “0101” on the four ancilla modes. We remove out_nodes and reset num_anc accordingly.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: For a pure measurement network, we take the four data photons as in_nodes, produce four ancilla photons internally via SPDC (num_anc=4), and detect only the ancilla modes. We set out_nodes empty, and define the two click patterns “1010” and “0101” on the four detectors as target_quantum. We remove unnecessary fields and ensure node numbering starts at zero.
