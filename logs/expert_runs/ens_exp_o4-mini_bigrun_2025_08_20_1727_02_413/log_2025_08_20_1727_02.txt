    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to combine strong photon blockade and nonclassical light in a Pytheus-compatible quantum\u2010network target:\n    1) A photon\u2010blockade\u2013assisted entanglement purification station: two noisy Bell pairs from probabilistic pair sources are purified by a linear\u2010optical parity\u2010check augmented with single\u2010emitter (blockade) nodes that suppress multi\u2010pair errors, heralding a higher\u2010fidelity Bell pair.\n    2) A deterministic Bell\u2010state analyzer using nonclassical ancilla photons and a single\u2010emitter \u201cnonlinear beam splitter\u201d in the Bell\u2010measurement station, enabling discrimination of all four Bell states without adaptive feed-forward.\n    3) A two\u2010hop photonic repeater segment: entanglement between A\u2013B and B\u2013C is swapped to A\u2013C, but the intermediate Bell\u2010measurement at B is performed using single\u2010emitter blockade elements and nonclassical single\u2010photon ancilla to suppress double\u2010emission from the pair sources.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and obstacles:\n    1) Purification: no prior Pytheus purification experiments listed; static network only, no feedback needed; uses single_emitters as blockade\u2014feasible.\n    2) Bell analyzer: no full Bell\u2010measurement experiments listed; but mapping measurement as target may be tricky for Pytheus\u2019s state\u2010generation form.\n    3) Two\u2010hop repeater: extends entanglement swapping beyond one swap, but relies on intermediate nodes of single_emitters; plausible but purification more direct.\n  Step 3: Pick the purification idea: it\u2019s novel (no prior purification in list), illustrates a transformation (classical-communication\u2013free heralded filtering), and fits Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (probabilistic sources, single_emitters, ancilla detectors, no dynamic feedback).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because nobody has used single\u2010emitter (photon\u2010blockade) devices inside a purely linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010purification circuit to suppress multi\u2010pair noise, nor has Pytheus been used to design a purification protocol.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only requires probabilistic pair sources, single_emitters (to model blockade), beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and static heralding\u2014no state generation beyond Bell states, no dynamic feedback, no cavities or squeezers.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:  \nProposal: Photon-Blockade\u2013Assisted Entanglement Purification Network\n\nExplanation:\nWe design a static linear-optical network that takes as input two noisy Bell pairs (from two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources) and outputs one purified Bell pair, using single\u2010emitter nodes (modeling strong photon blockade) to suppress two\u2010pair emissions. This implements the simplest recurrence purification protocol (parity check and post\u2010selection), but enhanced by photon blockade to reduce multi\u2010photon error terms. The network is heralded: upon specific ancilla detection patterns, the remaining two photons at detectors A and B are projected onto a higher\u2010fidelity Bell state.\n\nVisualization (sources \u2192 network \u2192 detectors):\n  Sources:\n    \u2022 Pair source S1 emits photons into modes A (node 0) and C (node 2).\n    \u2022 Pair source S2 emits photons into modes B (node 1) and D (node 3).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E1 inputs into ancilla mode E (node 4).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E2 inputs into ancilla mode F (node 5).\n  Linear\u2010optical network (beam splitters and phase shifters):\n    \u2022 Interfere C and D on a 50:50 beam splitter to perform a parity check.\n    \u2022 Route the two outputs through E1 and E2 respectively (enforcing \u22641 photon per mode).\n    \u2022 Perform photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detection on modes E and F.\n  Detectors:\n    \u2022 Heralding detectors on E, F: a \u201cone\u2010click\u201d event in each signals success.\n    \u2022 Output modes A (node 0) and B (node 1): number\u2010resolving detection after optional phase correction yields the purified Bell pair.\n\nKey Configuration Elements for Pytheus:\n  \u2022 probabilistic_pair_sources: [[0,2], [1,3]]\n  \u2022 single_emitters: [4,5]\n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [4,5]\n  \u2022 removed_connections: [] (we allow all to interfere except via blockade)\n  \u2022 target_quantum: ['00','11'] on output nodes [0,1]\n  \u2022 num_anc: 2\n  \u2022 number_resolving: True\n  \u2022 loss_func: 'cr'\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting:\n  \u2013 Combines nonclassical light (noisy entangled pairs) with a genuine single\u2010photon nonlinearity (photon blockade) to realize a purification step.\n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n  \u2013 Generalizable: by adding more pair sources and blockade nodes, one can design multi\u2010round purification chains or high-dimensional purification.\n  \u2013 The theory paper can analyze how photon blockade changes yield and fidelity compared to linear-optical purification.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to combine strong photon blockade and nonclassical light in a Pytheus-compatible quantum\u2010network target:\n    1) A photon\u2010blockade\u2013assisted entanglement purification station: two noisy Bell pairs from probabilistic pair sources are purified by a linear\u2010optical parity\u2010check augmented with single\u2010emitter (blockade) nodes that suppress multi\u2010pair errors, heralding a higher\u2010fidelity Bell pair.\n    2) A deterministic Bell\u2010state analyzer using nonclassical ancilla photons and a single\u2010emitter \u201cnonlinear beam splitter\u201d in the Bell\u2010measurement station, enabling discrimination of all four Bell states without adaptive feed-forward.\n    3) A two\u2010hop photonic repeater segment: entanglement between A\u2013B and B\u2013C is swapped to A\u2013C, but the intermediate Bell\u2010measurement at B is performed using single\u2010emitter blockade elements and nonclassical single\u2010photon ancilla to suppress double\u2010emission from the pair sources.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and obstacles:\n    1) Purification: no prior Pytheus purification experiments listed; static network only, no feedback needed; uses single_emitters as blockade\u2014feasible.\n    2) Bell analyzer: no full Bell\u2010measurement experiments listed; but mapping measurement as target may be tricky for Pytheus\u2019s state\u2010generation form.\n    3) Two\u2010hop repeater: extends entanglement swapping beyond one swap, but relies on intermediate nodes of single_emitters; plausible but purification more direct.\n  Step 3: Pick the purification idea: it\u2019s novel (no prior purification in list), illustrates a transformation (classical-communication\u2013free heralded filtering), and fits Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (probabilistic sources, single_emitters, ancilla detectors, no dynamic feedback).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because nobody has used single\u2010emitter (photon\u2010blockade) devices inside a purely linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010purification circuit to suppress multi\u2010pair noise, nor has Pytheus been used to design a purification protocol.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only requires probabilistic pair sources, single_emitters (to model blockade), beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and static heralding\u2014no state generation beyond Bell states, no dynamic feedback, no cavities or squeezers.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:  \nProposal: Photon-Blockade\u2013Assisted Entanglement Purification Network\n\nExplanation:\nWe design a static linear-optical network that takes as input two noisy Bell pairs (from two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources) and outputs one purified Bell pair, using single\u2010emitter nodes (modeling strong photon blockade) to suppress two\u2010pair emissions. This implements the simplest recurrence purification protocol (parity check and post\u2010selection), but enhanced by photon blockade to reduce multi\u2010photon error terms. The network is heralded: upon specific ancilla detection patterns, the remaining two photons at detectors A and B are projected onto a higher\u2010fidelity Bell state.\n\nVisualization (sources \u2192 network \u2192 detectors):\n  Sources:\n    \u2022 Pair source S1 emits photons into modes A (node 0) and C (node 2).\n    \u2022 Pair source S2 emits photons into modes B (node 1) and D (node 3).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E1 inputs into ancilla mode E (node 4).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E2 inputs into ancilla mode F (node 5).\n  Linear\u2010optical network (beam splitters and phase shifters):\n    \u2022 Interfere C and D on a 50:50 beam splitter to perform a parity check.\n    \u2022 Route the two outputs through E1 and E2 respectively (enforcing \u22641 photon per mode).\n    \u2022 Perform photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detection on modes E and F.\n  Detectors:\n    \u2022 Heralding detectors on E, F: a \u201cone\u2010click\u201d event in each signals success.\n    \u2022 Output modes A (node 0) and B (node 1): number\u2010resolving detection after optional phase correction yields the purified Bell pair.\n\nKey Configuration Elements for Pytheus:\n  \u2022 probabilistic_pair_sources: [[0,2], [1,3]]\n  \u2022 single_emitters: [4,5]\n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [4,5]\n  \u2022 removed_connections: [] (we allow all to interfere except via blockade)\n  \u2022 target_quantum: ['00','11'] on output nodes [0,1]\n  \u2022 num_anc: 2\n  \u2022 number_resolving: True\n  \u2022 loss_func: 'cr'\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting:\n  \u2013 Combines nonclassical light (noisy entangled pairs) with a genuine single\u2010photon nonlinearity (photon blockade) to realize a purification step.\n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n  \u2013 Generalizable: by adding more pair sources and blockade nodes, one can design multi\u2010round purification chains or high-dimensional purification.\n  \u2013 The theory paper can analyze how photon blockade changes yield and fidelity compared to linear-optical purification.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The purification protocol is a static state-generation task: generate a high-fidelity Bell state on modes 0 and 1, using two noisy Bell-pair inputs (modelled by 4 SPDC ancilla photons) and two single-emitter blockade nodes.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to combine strong photon blockade and nonclassical light in a Pytheus-compatible quantum\u2010network target:\n    1) A photon\u2010blockade\u2013assisted entanglement purification station: two noisy Bell pairs from probabilistic pair sources are purified by a linear\u2010optical parity\u2010check augmented with single\u2010emitter (blockade) nodes that suppress multi\u2010pair errors, heralding a higher\u2010fidelity Bell pair.\n    2) A deterministic Bell\u2010state analyzer using nonclassical ancilla photons and a single\u2010emitter \u201cnonlinear beam splitter\u201d in the Bell\u2010measurement station, enabling discrimination of all four Bell states without adaptive feed-forward.\n    3) A two\u2010hop photonic repeater segment: entanglement between A\u2013B and B\u2013C is swapped to A\u2013C, but the intermediate Bell\u2010measurement at B is performed using single\u2010emitter blockade elements and nonclassical single\u2010photon ancilla to suppress double\u2010emission from the pair sources.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and obstacles:\n    1) Purification: no prior Pytheus purification experiments listed; static network only, no feedback needed; uses single_emitters as blockade\u2014feasible.\n    2) Bell analyzer: no full Bell\u2010measurement experiments listed; but mapping measurement as target may be tricky for Pytheus\u2019s state\u2010generation form.\n    3) Two\u2010hop repeater: extends entanglement swapping beyond one swap, but relies on intermediate nodes of single_emitters; plausible but purification more direct.\n  Step 3: Pick the purification idea: it\u2019s novel (no prior purification in list), illustrates a transformation (classical-communication\u2013free heralded filtering), and fits Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (probabilistic sources, single_emitters, ancilla detectors, no dynamic feedback).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because nobody has used single\u2010emitter (photon\u2010blockade) devices inside a purely linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010purification circuit to suppress multi\u2010pair noise, nor has Pytheus been used to design a purification protocol.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only requires probabilistic pair sources, single_emitters (to model blockade), beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and static heralding\u2014no state generation beyond Bell states, no dynamic feedback, no cavities or squeezers.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:  \nProposal: Photon-Blockade\u2013Assisted Entanglement Purification Network\n\nExplanation:\nWe design a static linear-optical network that takes as input two noisy Bell pairs (from two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources) and outputs one purified Bell pair, using single\u2010emitter nodes (modeling strong photon blockade) to suppress two\u2010pair emissions. This implements the simplest recurrence purification protocol (parity check and post\u2010selection), but enhanced by photon blockade to reduce multi\u2010photon error terms. The network is heralded: upon specific ancilla detection patterns, the remaining two photons at detectors A and B are projected onto a higher\u2010fidelity Bell state.\n\nVisualization (sources \u2192 network \u2192 detectors):\n  Sources:\n    \u2022 Pair source S1 emits photons into modes A (node 0) and C (node 2).\n    \u2022 Pair source S2 emits photons into modes B (node 1) and D (node 3).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E1 inputs into ancilla mode E (node 4).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E2 inputs into ancilla mode F (node 5).\n  Linear\u2010optical network (beam splitters and phase shifters):\n    \u2022 Interfere C and D on a 50:50 beam splitter to perform a parity check.\n    \u2022 Route the two outputs through E1 and E2 respectively (enforcing \u22641 photon per mode).\n    \u2022 Perform photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detection on modes E and F.\n  Detectors:\n    \u2022 Heralding detectors on E, F: a \u201cone\u2010click\u201d event in each signals success.\n    \u2022 Output modes A (node 0) and B (node 1): number\u2010resolving detection after optional phase correction yields the purified Bell pair.\n\nKey Configuration Elements for Pytheus:\n  \u2022 probabilistic_pair_sources: [[0,2], [1,3]]\n  \u2022 single_emitters: [4,5]\n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [4,5]\n  \u2022 removed_connections: [] (we allow all to interfere except via blockade)\n  \u2022 target_quantum: ['00','11'] on output nodes [0,1]\n  \u2022 num_anc: 2\n  \u2022 number_resolving: True\n  \u2022 loss_func: 'cr'\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting:\n  \u2013 Combines nonclassical light (noisy entangled pairs) with a genuine single\u2010photon nonlinearity (photon blockade) to realize a purification step.\n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n  \u2013 Generalizable: by adding more pair sources and blockade nodes, one can design multi\u2010round purification chains or high-dimensional purification.\n  \u2013 The theory paper can analyze how photon blockade changes yield and fidelity compared to linear-optical purification.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The purification protocol is a static state-generation task: generate a high-fidelity Bell state on modes 0 and 1, using two noisy Bell-pair inputs (modelled by 4 SPDC ancilla photons) and two single-emitter blockade nodes.

FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to combine strong photon blockade and nonclassical light in a Pytheus-compatible quantum\u2010network target:\n    1) A photon\u2010blockade\u2013assisted entanglement purification station: two noisy Bell pairs from probabilistic pair sources are purified by a linear\u2010optical parity\u2010check augmented with single\u2010emitter (blockade) nodes that suppress multi\u2010pair errors, heralding a higher\u2010fidelity Bell pair.\n    2) A deterministic Bell\u2010state analyzer using nonclassical ancilla photons and a single\u2010emitter \u201cnonlinear beam splitter\u201d in the Bell\u2010measurement station, enabling discrimination of all four Bell states without adaptive feed-forward.\n    3) A two\u2010hop photonic repeater segment: entanglement between A\u2013B and B\u2013C is swapped to A\u2013C, but the intermediate Bell\u2010measurement at B is performed using single\u2010emitter blockade elements and nonclassical single\u2010photon ancilla to suppress double\u2010emission from the pair sources.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and obstacles:\n    1) Purification: no prior Pytheus purification experiments listed; static network only, no feedback needed; uses single_emitters as blockade\u2014feasible.\n    2) Bell analyzer: no full Bell\u2010measurement experiments listed; but mapping measurement as target may be tricky for Pytheus\u2019s state\u2010generation form.\n    3) Two\u2010hop repeater: extends entanglement swapping beyond one swap, but relies on intermediate nodes of single_emitters; plausible but purification more direct.\n  Step 3: Pick the purification idea: it\u2019s novel (no prior purification in list), illustrates a transformation (classical-communication\u2013free heralded filtering), and fits Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (probabilistic sources, single_emitters, ancilla detectors, no dynamic feedback).\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because nobody has used single\u2010emitter (photon\u2010blockade) devices inside a purely linear\u2010optical entanglement\u2010purification circuit to suppress multi\u2010pair noise, nor has Pytheus been used to design a purification protocol.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only requires probabilistic pair sources, single_emitters (to model blockade), beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and static heralding\u2014no state generation beyond Bell states, no dynamic feedback, no cavities or squeezers.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:  \nProposal: Photon-Blockade\u2013Assisted Entanglement Purification Network\n\nExplanation:\nWe design a static linear-optical network that takes as input two noisy Bell pairs (from two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources) and outputs one purified Bell pair, using single\u2010emitter nodes (modeling strong photon blockade) to suppress two\u2010pair emissions. This implements the simplest recurrence purification protocol (parity check and post\u2010selection), but enhanced by photon blockade to reduce multi\u2010photon error terms. The network is heralded: upon specific ancilla detection patterns, the remaining two photons at detectors A and B are projected onto a higher\u2010fidelity Bell state.\n\nVisualization (sources \u2192 network \u2192 detectors):\n  Sources:\n    \u2022 Pair source S1 emits photons into modes A (node 0) and C (node 2).\n    \u2022 Pair source S2 emits photons into modes B (node 1) and D (node 3).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E1 inputs into ancilla mode E (node 4).\n    \u2022 Single\u2010emitter blockade node E2 inputs into ancilla mode F (node 5).\n  Linear\u2010optical network (beam splitters and phase shifters):\n    \u2022 Interfere C and D on a 50:50 beam splitter to perform a parity check.\n    \u2022 Route the two outputs through E1 and E2 respectively (enforcing \u22641 photon per mode).\n    \u2022 Perform photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detection on modes E and F.\n  Detectors:\n    \u2022 Heralding detectors on E, F: a \u201cone\u2010click\u201d event in each signals success.\n    \u2022 Output modes A (node 0) and B (node 1): number\u2010resolving detection after optional phase correction yields the purified Bell pair.\n\nKey Configuration Elements for Pytheus:\n  \u2022 probabilistic_pair_sources: [[0,2], [1,3]]\n  \u2022 single_emitters: [4,5]\n  \u2022 anc_detectors: [4,5]\n  \u2022 removed_connections: [] (we allow all to interfere except via blockade)\n  \u2022 target_quantum: ['00','11'] on output nodes [0,1]\n  \u2022 num_anc: 2\n  \u2022 number_resolving: True\n  \u2022 loss_func: 'cr'\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting:\n  \u2013 Combines nonclassical light (noisy entangled pairs) with a genuine single\u2010photon nonlinearity (photon blockade) to realize a purification step.\n  \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n  \u2013 Generalizable: by adding more pair sources and blockade nodes, one can design multi\u2010round purification chains or high-dimensional purification.\n  \u2013 The theory paper can analyze how photon blockade changes yield and fidelity compared to linear-optical purification.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The purification protocol is a static state-generation task: generate a high-fidelity Bell state on modes 0 and 1, using two noisy Bell-pair inputs (modelled by 4 SPDC ancilla photons) and two single-emitter blockade nodes.
