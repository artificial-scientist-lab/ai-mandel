}###Title: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs

Abstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |Φ⁺⟩=(|00⟩+|11⟩)/√2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing ≤1-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.
