Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We implement both θ=0 (singlet) and θ=π/2 (triplet) projectors as two separate, structurally identical heralded modules with different target_quantum/amplitudes settings, and invoke pytheus with both configs.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Loss function not specified in config file. Needs to be specified by 'loss_func' key.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because pytheus expects a single configuration object, not an array under "configs". I will first run the singlet projector configuration as a standalone JSON config.

Error Message: ValueError: thresholds not defined in config file. Please define thresholds as list of floats (length = 2).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Added missing thresholds key and will run the singlet-manifold projector configuration.
