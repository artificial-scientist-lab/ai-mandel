Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now treats the task as a heralded generation of the four-photon GHZ Choi state |0000>+|1111> by forbidding direct SPDC connections between output modes, uses a fidelity-based optimization, two ancilla detectors, and one SPDC source. This is ready to run in Pytheus.
