}###Title:  
Heralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  

Mini-abstract:  
We propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach–Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00〉+|11〉 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.
