PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 3 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration had inconsistent mode counts—now I align string lengths, node indices, inputs, outputs, and ancilla detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration maps 6 modes for the unknown qubit, two ancilla tests, and two output ports. Aligning the indices so that nodes 0–5 are used: input at 0, first SWAP ancilla at 1–2, second SWAP ancilla at 3–4, outputs at nodes 4–5; detectors on ancilla modes 2 and 3. Using num_anc=2 for the two SWAP-test ancilla photons.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The full binary SWAP-test routing classifier is beyond Pytheus’s current matching constraints, but its core building block is a controlled‐SWAP (Fredkin) gate. I’ll generate the post‐selected Fredkin gate configuration to realize that unit.
