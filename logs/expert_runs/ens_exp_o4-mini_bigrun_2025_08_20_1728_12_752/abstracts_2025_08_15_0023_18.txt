Title: “Delocalized Super-Teleportation to Dual Corner Modes in a Static Linear-Optical Network”

Mini-abstract: We propose and analyze a Pyt\*heu\*s protocol that teleports an arbitrary single-photon qubit from input node 0 into the coherent superposition of two spatially separated output corners (nodes 1 and 3) in a static linear-optical network, using only four probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-swap measurements, a balanced beam splitter, and post-selection on a specific two-click pattern. The target state |ψ⟩ = (|10⟩ + |01⟩)/√2 across modes 1 and 3 is directly realized—an exact network analogue of a delocalized second-order photonic topological corner mode.
