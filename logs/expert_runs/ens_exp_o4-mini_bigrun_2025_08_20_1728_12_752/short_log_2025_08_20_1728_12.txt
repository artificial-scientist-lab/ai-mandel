Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s delocalized super-teleportation proposal: a single-photon in mode 0 is teleported into the even superposition across output corner modes 1 and 3, using four SPDC ancillas, static LO, Bell swaps, a beamsplitter, and post-selection (heralding_out=true). Ready to invoke Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because nodes must form a contiguous set 0…N matching the ket length. We add a vacuum placeholder mode 2 so modes 0–3 are covered. We update the kets to length 4: “0100” and “0001”. This ensures in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1,3] and node 2 is included as a zero mode.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 1 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirement that the union of in_nodes and out_nodes be a contiguous 0…N–1 set, we include node 2 as a “dummy” output mode (always empty in the target kets). We then set out_nodes=[1,2,3] and use 4-digit kets “0100” and “0001” so that node 2’s entry is always 0. We only forbid the two unintended SPDC links (0–3 and 1–2). This preserves the original teleportation into corners 1 & 3.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure stems from overly strict connection bans preventing any solution. To fix this while preserving the teleportation target (superposition on corners 1 & 3), I’ll restore a contiguous node set by including a dummy output mode 2, and remove the “removed_connections” constraint so Pytheus can find a valid network.
