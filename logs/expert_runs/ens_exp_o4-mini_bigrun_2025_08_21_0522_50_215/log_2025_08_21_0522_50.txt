    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit. It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit. It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit. It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit. It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three primitives mixing anti-PT and topological photonics into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network (no state-generation):\n 1) A heralded two-qubit gate mediated by an anti-PT SSH mesh (we already tried; too close to PT-CNOT).  \n 2) An ancilla-heralded interferometric measurement mapping four Bell inputs onto four distinct click patterns using a topological, non-Hermitian beam-splitter loop (a Bell-state analyzer).  \n 3) A repeater-style entanglement swap whose success probability directly encodes an anti-PT topological invariant via parallel paths (too similar to percolation swaps).\n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n \u2022 Idea #2 is new\u2014no prior Pytheus analyzer has used anti-PT/SSH loops to beat the 50% Bell-measurement limit. It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s phrased as an analyzer (not state gen), uses only linear optics & ancilla, and fits Pytheus\u2019s \u201canalyzer\u201d tasks (Yeo-Chua, Mean King).  \n \u2022 Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter meshes with ancilla photons, removed_connections, and imaginary couplings.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #2: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\n \u2022 First linear-optics Bell-analyzer that uses a synthetic anti-PT SSH ring of beam splitters to achieve unambiguous discrimination of all four Bell states with heralded ancilla.  \n \u2022 Unites non-Hermitian topological photonics with a fundamental quantum-network primitive (Bell measurement).\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Targets a mapping (analyzer) rather than state generation.  \n \u2022 Uses two input modes for the Bell state plus two ancilla photon-pair sources.  \n \u2022 Imaginary=True to allow non-unitary, anti-PT\u2013style couplings.  \n \u2022 Only linear optics, threshold detectors, no feedback or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201cAnti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want a linear-optics network that takes as input one of the four polarization-encoded Bell states on modes A and B, uses two ancilla photons in modes C/D, and\u2014after passing through an alternating imaginary-coupling (anti-PT SSH) loop of beam splitters\u2014funnels the four possible Bell inputs into four distinct detector-click patterns on six detectors (0\u20135), unambiguously distinguishing all four Bell states.\n\n1) Inputs:\n   \u2022 Two unknown photonic qubits (the Bell state) enter on modes 0 and 1.  \n   \u2022 One ancilla photon pair (two probabilistic pair sources) populates modes 2\u20133 and 4\u20135.\n\n2) Linear-optics mesh:\n   \u2022 A ring of four beam splitters connecting modes (1\u21922), (2\u21923), (3\u21924), (4\u21925), (5\u21920), with alternating imaginary coupling strengths to simulate a two-cell SSH chain under anti-PT symmetry.  \n   \u2022 This non-unitary loop breaks the usual 50% Bell-analysis bound by routing each Bell basis into a unique interference signature.\n\n3) Detectors:\n   \u2022 Six threshold detectors on modes 0\u20135, all read out by Charlie.  \n   \u2022 Exactly one distinct two-click pattern per Bell state is the herald of which Bell input was present.\n\n4) Target mapping:\n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,3}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {1,4}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {2,5}  \n   \u2022 Input |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9 \u2192 clicks {0,5}\n\n5) Pytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  foldername:   \"APT_Topo_BSA\",\n  num_anc:      2,  \n  loss_func:    \"analyzer_cr\",  \n  optimizer:    \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:      20,\n  target_map: {  \n    \"|\u03a6+>\": [0,3],  \n    \"|\u03a6->\": [1,4],  \n    \"|\u03a8+>\": [2,5],  \n    \"|\u03a8->\": [0,5]  \n  },\n  removed_connections: [\n    [0,1], [2,4], [3,5]   // forbid trivial bypasses\n  ],\n  imaginary:    True,\n  number_resolving: True\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n sources: [Bell_input(0,1)], [pair(2,3)], [pair(4,5)]\n loop: alternating\u2010imaginary beam\u2010splitters in a 0\u21922\u21923\u21924\u21925\u21920 ring\n detectors: [0][1][2][3][4][5]\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n \u2022 Realizes a fundamental quantum-network primitive (complete Bell measurement) using anti-PT topological features.  \n \u2022 Tests how non-Hermitian topology can overcome linear-optics limitations.  \n \u2022 Easily extended to higher-dimensional Bell analysis or multi-cell SSH loops.  \n \u2022 Theory paper potential: \u201cBreaking the Linear-Optics Bell-Measurement Bound with Non-Hermitian Topology.\u201d\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: The Anti-PT topological Bell\u2010state analyzer configuration is now encoded in a Pytheus\u2010compatible JSON.
