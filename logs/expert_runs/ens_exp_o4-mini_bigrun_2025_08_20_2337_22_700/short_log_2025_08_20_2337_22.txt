Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity‐TTN config needs correct 9‐bit mappings per input with parity output and heralding ancillas, plus tree‐enforcing removed_connections and anc_detectors. I'll run Pytheus with the updated target_quantum list.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (9) does not match number of in/out nodes (1 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because target_quantum bitstrings must cover only the in_nodes and out_nodes (5 bits), not the ancilla detectors. I'll remove the ancilla bits from target_quantum and supply correct 5-bit parity mappings.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because discrete-variable mappings require ‘fid’ (fidelity) rather than Fock count‐rate. I’ll switch to loss_func "fid", adjust thresholds, and omit number_resolving and anc_detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure arose because an odd total photon number (9) breaks perfect matchings. By reducing to 3 ancilla photons, we have 4 inputs + 1 output + 3 ancillas = 8 total modes, an even number suitable for a matching graph. We’ll switch back to 'fid' fidelity loss for the discrete mapping and adjust removed_connections for three ancilla nodes (5,6,7).
