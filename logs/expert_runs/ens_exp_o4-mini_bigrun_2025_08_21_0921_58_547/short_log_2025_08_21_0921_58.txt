Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to encode the teleportation channel as an identity mapping from Alice’s input mode (0) to Bob’s output mode (2), using six SPDC‐generated ancilla photons (two for the pre‐shared Bell pair on modes 1&2, plus four for Alice’s Bell‐measurement). I forbid any direct 0→2 connection via removed_connections, post‐select on ancilla clicks (heralding_out), and maximize basis‐state fidelity (loss_func="fid") across the qutrit basis.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because nodes must be contiguous starting at zero—our out_node was 2, leaving a gap at node 1. I’ll renumber the output node to 1, so with in_nodes=[0] and out_nodes=[1], the target_quantum strings (“00”,“11”,“22”) match a one-to-one identity mapping for the qutrit. Ancillas (num_anc=6) occupy nodes 2–7, and we forbid direct 0→1 with removed_connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
