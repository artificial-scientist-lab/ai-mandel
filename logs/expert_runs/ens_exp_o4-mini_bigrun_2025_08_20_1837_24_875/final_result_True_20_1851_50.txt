}###Title: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, √SWAP, i√SWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.
