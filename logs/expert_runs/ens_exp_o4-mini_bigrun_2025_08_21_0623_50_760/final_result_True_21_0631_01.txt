Heralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation

Mini-Abstract:  
We introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries Uₓ=exp(−iπX₁X₂X₃X₄/4) and U_z=exp(−iπZ₁Z₂Z₃Z₄/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number–resolving detectors. Concatenating Uₓ then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{−iθH_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.
