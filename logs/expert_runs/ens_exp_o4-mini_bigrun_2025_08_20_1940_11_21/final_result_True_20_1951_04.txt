}###Title: Flux‐Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring

Abstract: We propose a static, linear‐optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one‐dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single‐photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge‐flux phase φ on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping—|1,0,0⟩_ABC→|0,1,0⟩_ABC (A→B channel) at φ=π or |0,0,1⟩_ABC (A→C channel) at φ=0—with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.
