Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The sketched config had invalid `target_quantum`, no `in_nodes`/`out_nodes`, and mis‐numbered single‐emitter modes. To faithfully represent the 2‐qubit identity mapping under heralded ancilla measurements—control E and signal S enter as modes 0,1 emitters; SPDC provides ancilla B1,B2; outputs are control and receiver in modes 2,3; and we post-select on two ancilla clicks—we set  
• target_quantum = ["0000","0101","1010","1111"]  
• in_nodes = [0,1], out_nodes = [2,3]  
• num_anc = 2 (the SPDC pair), single_emitters = [0,1]  
• heralding_out = true, so only ancilla detectors click.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I mistakenly listed input modes as single_emitters. The control and signal photons should be in in_nodes, and ancilla photons come from probabilistic pair sources (num_anc). Thus, remove single_emitters to ensure disjointness.
