}###Title: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits

Mini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |ψ⟩ₐ at node A and |φ⟩_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.
