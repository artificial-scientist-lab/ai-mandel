Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration has been refined to correctly encode a 4→1 parity TTN with parity outputs and four ancilla herald detectors enforcing the tree structure. I will run Pytheus with this JSON config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (9) does not match number of in/out nodes (1 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target strings included ancilla modes, causing a mismatch with in/out nodes. I will redefine the target purely on the 4 input and 1 output qubits (5 modes), let Pytheus allocate and herald the 4 ancillas automatically, and drop removed_connections. This matches the format of other transformations.

There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatches indicate Pytheus treats all 9 modes (4 inputs, 1 output, 4 ancillas) as part of the target. I will provide 9-bit target kets including the ancilla detections ('1111') and omit in_nodes/out_nodes so the string length matches the total modes. I’ll disable heralding_out so all detectors click on success.
