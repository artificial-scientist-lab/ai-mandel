}###Title: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality

Abstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A–C correlations—tagged by B’s heralding pattern—to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.
