Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested bilocality-test protocol is mapped to a heralded entanglement‐swapping configuration: two SPDC sources feed modes 0–1 and 2–3; a static Bell measurement on modes 1–2 is heralded by four ancilla detectors (4–7); modes 0 and 3 remain as the entangled outputs. We fix the target two‐mode Bell state |00>+|11>, use num_anc=4, heralding_out=true, and remove any direct source connection between 0 and 3.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error occurred because Pytheus expected the union of in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes to form a contiguous index range starting at 0. To match the entanglement‐swapping style examples, I will leave in_nodes and out_nodes empty so that Pytheus treats modes 0 and 1 as the target outputs, uses SPDC pair sources to supply 4 ancilla photons (nodes 2–5), and enforces removed_connections to prevent a common source linking modes 0 and 1. This matches the ES_246 pattern and should satisfy Pytheus’s indexing requirements.
