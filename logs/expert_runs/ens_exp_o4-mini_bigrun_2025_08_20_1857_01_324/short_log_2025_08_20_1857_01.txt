Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for the nonlocal parity (XOR) gate between two Z-basis users is ready; submitting it to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that input nodes shouldn’t be listed as single photon emitters. Remove Alice and Bob from single_emitters since ancillas come from SPDC (num_anc).

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The design likely needs more ancilla photons to realize the nonlocal parity mapping. I will increase `num_anc` to 4 with two SPDC sources (`num_pre=2`) and keep the rest of the mapping the same, then resubmit to Pytheus.
