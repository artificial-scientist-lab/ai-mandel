Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed configuration uses a single‐photon emitter for the data qubit, eight ancilla photons from SPDC sources for the four Bell measurements around the toric loop, and encodes the logical Hadamard as |0>→|+>, |1>→|−> via target_quantum and amplitudes. We optimize fidelity with a DV loss function. This matches Pytheus’s capabilities and represents the measurement‐driven anyon braiding. I will submit this configuration to design the experiment.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Removed single_emitters to avoid conflict with in_nodes and treat the data qubit as an incoming photon. Submitting updated config to design the logical Hadamard by anyon braiding.
