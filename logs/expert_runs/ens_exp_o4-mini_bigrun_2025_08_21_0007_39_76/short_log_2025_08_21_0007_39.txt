Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target mapping strings were incorrect for the cycle (1→2→3→1). Fixing them yields the 8 correct six‐digit mappings (input triple then output triple = i0i1i2 i2i0i1). Proceed to run Pytheus.

There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The attempted teleportation‐router design fails because pytheus requires even total photon count across all modes and explicit dual-rail encoding for qubits, so our 6-mode encoding with odd total photons and single-mode qubits is incompatible with pytheus’s fock‐state matching. The router primitive is too complex to express as a single post‐selected fock‐transformation in pytheus without dual-rail mode expansion (doubling all modes) and even total photon number.  
Action: Final Answer

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates we had an odd number of detection modes (3 outputs + 3 ancillas with heralding), so no perfect matching exists. We must include the output detectors as clicks so the total detector count is even. Thus set heralding_out to null (false) so both outputs and ancilla detectors click. Retry with that fix.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus cannot handle the full three-qubit teleportation primitive with Bell-measurements, but it can design a purely passive three-mode cyclic photonic router implementing |a,b,c⟩→|c,a,b⟩ on dual-rail qubits via postselection. We drop ancillas and postselect on detecting all six photons.
