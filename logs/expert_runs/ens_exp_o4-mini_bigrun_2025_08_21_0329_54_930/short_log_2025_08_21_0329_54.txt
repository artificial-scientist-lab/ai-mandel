Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The modified configuration sets up two SPDC ancilla sources performing heralded Bell measurements on interior links, forbids diagonal connections to enforce SSH topology, and targets a Bell pair between corner modes 0 and 3. This matches the teleportation-style entanglement swapping protocol for corner-to-corner state transfer, so I'll run it in Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous configuration incorrectly indexed nodes and output modes. To represent a two-photon Bell state on the four corner rails (modes 0–3), I must use Fock‐basis strings of length 4, namely ["1010","0101"], and declare these as the target_quantum. I set out_nodes to [0,1,2,3] so these photons are left unmeasured, use two SPDC ancilla sources (num_anc=2) for the interior Bell measurements, heralding_out=true to keep the corner photons, and forbid all non‐SSH edges via removed_connections. This ensures a contiguous node set and matches Pytheus’s requirements.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates the setup is too constrained for two ancillas under the removed_connections. To find a viable protocol, I'll relax restrictions by removing forbidden links and increase ancilla resources from 2 to 4. This gives Pytheus more flexibility to design the Bell-pair creation between corners 0 and 3.
