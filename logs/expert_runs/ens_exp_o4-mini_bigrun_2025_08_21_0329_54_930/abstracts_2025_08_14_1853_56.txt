Title:
Topology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2×2 SSH Photonic Network

Mini-abstract:
We propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2×2 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection—and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source—the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.
