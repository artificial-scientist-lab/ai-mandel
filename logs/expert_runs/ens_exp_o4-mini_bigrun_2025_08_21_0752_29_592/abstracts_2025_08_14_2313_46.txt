Title:  
“Single-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping”

Mini-abstract:  
We implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator ⟨ψ|Z₁X₂…Xₙ₋₁Zₙ|ψ⟩ in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.
