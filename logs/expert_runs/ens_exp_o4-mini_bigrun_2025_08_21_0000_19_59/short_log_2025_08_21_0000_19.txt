SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested config needs explicit fields for all eight photons, ancillas, and measurement patterns. I'll include `in_nodes` for all photons and set reasonable thresholds.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes (modes 0–3) overlap with single_emitters. To resolve this, we drop single_emitters (use SPDC ancillas for the Bell pairs) and keep in_nodes for the four atom inputs.

Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 4 out).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need a measurement‐style config: eight input modes (the four “atom” photons plus four ancilla photons), all detected, with num_anc equal the number of detectors (8). Set in_nodes=[0–7], out_nodes empty, loss_func='cr', and target_quantum patterns of length 8. Then call pytheus.
