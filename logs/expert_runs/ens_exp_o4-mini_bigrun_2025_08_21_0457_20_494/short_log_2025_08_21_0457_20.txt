SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested config had inconsistent node indexing and missing heralding settings. I corrected the dual-rail encoding by mapping the two-qubit inputs on modes 0,1 to outputs on modes 2,3, added heralding on the two ancilla emitters (modes 4 and 5), set removed_connections to forbid any direct coupling between mode 1 and 2, and used the discrete-variable CZ target with amplitudes [1,1,1,-1].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates missing 'tries_per_edge', so I'll add it along with a null seed and ensure the config matches dual-rail CZ conventions exactly.
