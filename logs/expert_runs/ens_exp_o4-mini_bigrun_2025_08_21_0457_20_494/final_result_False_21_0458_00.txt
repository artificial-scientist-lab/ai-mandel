Heralded Bound-State Mediated Controlled-Z Gate for Dual-Rail Photonic Qubits

Mini-abstract:  
We propose and implement a heralded symmetry-protected dark bound-state mediated controlled-Z (CZ) gate acting on dual-rail photonic qubits encoded in modes (0,1) and (2,3), with two single-photon ancillas injected into modes 4 and 5. Number-resolving detection of the ancillas projects the two-qubit target system—spanned by |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, |11⟩—onto a dark bound state that applies a π phase exclusively to |11⟩, thereby realizing a high-fidelity CZ primitive.
