SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration has been updated to match the researcher’s suggestion: two SPDC sources (num_anc=2), the two signal modes as undetected outputs (out_nodes=[0,1]) with heralding_out=true, and removed_connections ensuring no direct source between the signal modes. The target Bell state ["00","11"] remains unchanged.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous run failed due to too few ancillas and overly strict restrictions. The proposal calls for fourfold heralding of ancilla detections. I'll align with the standard entanglement‐swapping example: use four ancilla photons (num_anc=4), no explicit in/out nodes (all photons from SPDC), herald only the ancilla detectors (heralding_out=true), and keep the restriction preventing any source directly linking the two signal modes (removed_connections=[[0,1]]).
