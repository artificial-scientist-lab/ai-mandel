}###Title:  
Heralded Linear‐Optical Two-Qutrit SUM Gate (mod 3) in Laguerre–Gaussian OAM Modes  

Mini-abstract:  
We present a Pythous-optimized, heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SUM gate U_S∶|i⟩_A|j⟩_B → |i⟩_A|i⊕j (mod 3)⟩_B on single photons encoded in Laguerre–Gaussian OAM modes ℓ∈{−1,0,1}.  Using only static beam splitters, phase shifters, two SPDC ancilla sources and number-resolving detectors—with a unique four-click ancilla pattern to herald success—this is the first explicit high-dimensional entangling gate realized in the OAM platform.
