SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion had some typos in the target mapping and an invalid loss function. I will correct the SUM‐gate mapping (mod 3) to match ∣i,j⟩→∣i,i⊕j⟩ exactly, replace “max_like” with the valid “cr” loss function, and add the standard gate fields in_nodes and out_nodes as in similar high-dimensional gates.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates input nodes cannot coincide with single emitters. The qutrit inputs should be treated as external inputs (in_nodes) and not as emitters. I'll remove single_emitters and add heralding_out=true so only ancilla detectors click, preserving output photons. I'll also switch loss_func to 'cr'.
