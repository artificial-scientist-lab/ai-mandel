SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches a static post-selected measurement on the four C-modes with no ancillas, projecting onto Z=0,X=0 parity via the patterns “1100” or “0011”, and forbidding any SPDC linking S₁→R₂ or S₂→R₁.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue arises because removed_connections must refer to detector nodes (out_nodes or anc_detectors), not in_nodes. I'll switch the detection nodes to out_nodes and leave in_nodes empty, so removed_connections pairs refer to out_nodes indices.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates ancillas are required for this 4-mode parity measurement. I’ll introduce two ancilla photons (num_anc=2) and retry with the same detector topology and removed_connections.
