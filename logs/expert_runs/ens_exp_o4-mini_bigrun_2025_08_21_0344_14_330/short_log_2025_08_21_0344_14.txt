SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested config had mismatched target strings and mode counts. We need four ancilla detectors (num_anc=4), target patterns of length 4 matching the two swap-test outcomes (“00” or “11” for each), and list the four atom emitters as single_emitters. All other fields align.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Single_emitters and in_nodes must be disjoint; atom qubits come from single_emitters at positions 0–3, ancilla detectors are in_nodes at 4–7; target_quantum strings length=4.

Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement config requires num_anc = total detectors = in_nodes (4) + ancilla sources (4) = 8, single_emitters empty, in_nodes disjoint, out_nodes empty, heralding_out false.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target_quantum should match the four input atom modes (4-digit strings), num_anc=4 ancilla photons by SPDC, single_emitters empty, in_nodes list input modes, out_nodes empty, heralding_out false.
