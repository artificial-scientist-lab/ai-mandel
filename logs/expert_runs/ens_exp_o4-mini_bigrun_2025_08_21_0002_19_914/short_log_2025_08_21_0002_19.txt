Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Configuration assembled for multipartite entanglement swapping—fusing two GHZ₃ into GHZ₄ via one static linear‐optical 4-photon measurement. Proceed to run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the node indices were noncontiguous. I must list all input nodes (0–5) and ancilla nodes (6,7) so that nodes run 0 through 7. Also correct num_anc to two (two ancilla photons) and remove explicit anc_detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The errors stemmed from disallowed in_node/out_node overlaps and non‐contiguous indices. To treat this as a static GHZ₄ state generation via a four‐click post‐selective GHZ fusion, we model no external inputs (in_nodes=[]), four output modes (out_nodes=[] auto-inferred), and four ancilla detections from SPDC sources. We forbid any SPDC source from linking the four final modes by removing all pairwise connections. This yields a contiguous index set 0–3 for outputs and 4 ancilla detectors implicit in num_anc.
