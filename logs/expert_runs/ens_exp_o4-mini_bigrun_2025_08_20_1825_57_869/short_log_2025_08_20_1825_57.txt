Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The simplified three‐party GHZ entanglement‐swapping primitive with two heralded ancillas and a post‐selected GHZ measurement on three input modes is encoded in the following Pytheus configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I omitted the required tries_per_edge and removed_connections keys. I’ll add these with default values and rerun the GHZ‐swap configuration.
