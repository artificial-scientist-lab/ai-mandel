Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects the suggested catalytic entanglement–swapping protocol without altering the target. It specifies no ancilla photons, uses number-resolving detection, forbids unwanted connections, and aims to herald the two Bell pairs on modes [0,1] and [6,7].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: thresholds not defined in config file. Please define thresholds as list of floats (length = 2).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous configuration omitted the required thresholds field. I will add thresholds [0.3, 0.1] consistent with a 'cr' loss function and rerun.
