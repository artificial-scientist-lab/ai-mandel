Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The SSH‐corner teleportation protocol can be cast as an entanglement‐swapping experiment to generate a Bell pair between corners 0 and 3 by post‐selecting on interior Bell measurements. We run Pytheus with the proposed configuration to find a static linear‐optical implementation.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The node-index continuity error arose from specifying output nodes in a state-generation scenario. For a pure Bell-state generation, we should omit `in_nodes` and `out_nodes` altogether, matching the accepted ES_246 pattern. We'll drop those fields and include `thresholds` so that Pytheus treats this as state generation with heralded ancilla.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjusting the ancilla count to match two SPDC sources (4 ancilla photons) and preserving the SSH‐style adjacency constraints while generating a 2‐photon Bell pair.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The state‐generation task should be treated like ES_246: remove heralding_out, set it to null, include tries_per_edge, and increase ancilla to four (two SPDC pairs). This way no in/out nodes are needed and the adjacency constraints apply to the four‐mode graph.
