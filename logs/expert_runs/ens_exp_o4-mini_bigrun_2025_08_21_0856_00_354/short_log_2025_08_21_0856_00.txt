Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for the post‐selected quantum butterfly network measurement is ready; running Pytheus with this setup.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The in_nodes and single_emitters indices overlapped. I will treat the four spin‐photon inputs as incoming (in_nodes=[0,1,2,3]) and use two ancilla emitters at new positions [4,5] with num_anc=2.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates we need at least as many ancilla detectors as incoming plus emitter photons. We have 4 in_nodes and 6 single_emitters => need num_anc=10. But better to use single_emitters=[4-9] and num_anc=6 (no, 4 in_nodes +6 single_emitters =10, need num_anc=10). Because no out_nodes, all 10 photons must be detected. So set num_anc=6? Actually the formula: num_anc >= len(in_nodes)+len(single_emitters)-len(out_nodes)=4+6-0=10. So num_anc=10, single_emitters [4..9] and SPDC? But single_emitters adds 6, so total photons=4+6=10, require 10 detectors -> num_anc=6? No out_nodes empty => all 10 detected. So num_anc=6 is wrong. num_anc counts ancilla photons, detectors count all. num_anc=6 fine. Actually pytheus num_anc means number of ancilla photons; in_nodes count incoming, and out_nodes count outputs. Condition is num_anc >= len(in_nodes)+len(single_emitters)-len(out_nodes)-len(out_nodes)=4+6-0=10, so num_anc must be 10. So use 10 ancilla photons from SPDC? But if we use single_emitters 6, num_anc is those emitters; plus in_nodes=4, sum=10 ancilla? Hard.

Better: use SPDC ancilla: single_emitters empty, num_anc=4? Then total photons= in_nodes 4 + ancilla 4 =8, need ancilla detectors=4. Enough. But then we lose emitter sources. Instead, set single_emitters empty, num_anc=4, total photons=4+4=8, require detectors=8, goes through fine. Try that: in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], single_emitters=[], num_anc=4.

Action: run with single_emitters=[] and num_anc=4.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and single_emitters were misassigned. Treat the four photons (two spin–photon inputs plus two ancilla photons) all as single_emitters feeding the joint measurement; have no in_nodes or out_nodes, set num_anc=4 detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Recast the butterfly measurement as a four‐photon post‐selected analyzer with four incoming modes and four detectors, mirroring the W/GHZ measurement examples—no single_emitters, in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], num_anc=4, and target_quantum listing the four click‐patterns.
