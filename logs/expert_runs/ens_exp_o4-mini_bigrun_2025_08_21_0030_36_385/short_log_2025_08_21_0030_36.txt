Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The “quantum butterfly” is a post-selected four-photon joint measurement: four single-photon emitters feed modes 0–3 into a static interferometer, with four detectors clicking in one of four specific patterns (‘1100’, ‘0011’, ‘1010’, ‘0101’) that herald the two cross-Bell measurements and hence simultaneous cross-teleportation. We set in_nodes to [0,1,2,3], out_nodes empty, number_resolving detectors, num_anc=4 total detectors, single_emitters at [0,1,2,3], and target_quantum the four detection patterns. Action: pytheus

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust measurement configuration to include ancilla photons via SPDC (no single_emitters), set num_anc to 6 detectors (4 inputs + 2 ancillas), in_nodes disjoint from single_emitters, use target_quantum for four-input patterns, out_nodes empty.
