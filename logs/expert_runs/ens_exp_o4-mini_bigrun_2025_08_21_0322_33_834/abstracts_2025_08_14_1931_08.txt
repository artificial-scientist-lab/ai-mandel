Title: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t₁ and t₂, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t₁, four at t₂) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.
