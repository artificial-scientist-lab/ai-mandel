Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to provide a complete Pytheus configuration matching the temporal-mode multiplexed swapping idea without altering the researcher's target.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because num_anc (number of detectors) must match the length of target patterns when out_nodes is empty, and the target strings must match in_nodes×dimensions. I’ll set num_anc=8, use four spatial input nodes, specify dimensions=[2], and list the eight valid two-click patterns across the two time bins.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because for a measurement-type experiment Pytheus expects target strings of length equal to the number of input modes (in_nodes). We must specify in_nodes matching each digit of the 6-bit patterns (six input photons) and set num_anc equal to that. Then each 6-bit string defines one two-click pattern.
