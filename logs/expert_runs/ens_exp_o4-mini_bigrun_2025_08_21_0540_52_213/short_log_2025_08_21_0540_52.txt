Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures the suggested time‐multiplexed entanglement‐swap station with one ancilla Bell pair reused across two time bins via a delay loop and number‐resolving, time‐tagging detection. I'll run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust configuration to satisfy Pytheus requirements by listing only the actual input photons (four unknown qubits) in `in_nodes` and increasing `num_anc` to 4 so that `num_anc >= len(in_nodes) - len(out_nodes)`. Also duplicate the four two‐click patterns to cover both time bins via `dimensions=[2]`, yielding eight entries in `target_quantum`.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus measurement‐scheme requirements, I treat all six inputs (4 unknown qubits + 2 ancilla photons) as incoming modes and set num_anc=6 (number of detectors). I remove loops/dimensions since Pytheus doesn’t support time‐bin dimensions in measurements. I provide eight two‐click patterns (strings of length 6) for target_quantum.
