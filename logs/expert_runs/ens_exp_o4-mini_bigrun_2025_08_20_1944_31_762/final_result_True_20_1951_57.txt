On‐Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification

Mini‐Abstract:  
We propose a fully passive linear‐optical chip that employs a single‐photon control qubit in state |+〉₀ to coherently superpose two Bell‐pair network operations—entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity‐check purification of nodes A and B—using only SPDC sources, a control‐switch interferometer, and number‐resolving detectors. The device targets the transformation  
|+〉₀⊗(|00〉+|11〉)_{1,2}⊗(|00〉+|11〉)_{3,4} → |0〉₀⊗|Φ⁺〉_{A,D} + |1〉₀⊗ρ^{pur}_{A,B},  
heralded by distinct detection patterns, thereby realizing a new higher‐order quantum network primitive for programmable photonic processors.
