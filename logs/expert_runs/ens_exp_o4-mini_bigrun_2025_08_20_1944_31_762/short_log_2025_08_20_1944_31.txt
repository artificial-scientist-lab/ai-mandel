SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion describes a static LOQC network implementing a superposition of two Bell-pair network functions (entanglement swapping vs purification) controlled by a single-photon qubit. To encode this in Pytheus, we define a 5-mode transformation: a control mode (0) and two Bell pairs on modes (1,2) and (3,4). We post-select on ancillas (6 photons) to herald the two functions, yielding an output in the same five modes reflecting the joint superposed state across the control and the two output photons (A and D for swapping, A and B for purification). We list the eight nonzero basis mappings corresponding to the two Bell-pair inputs for both control states. We enforce no direct SPDC sources across the two pairs via removed_connections. We include one single-photon emitter for the control, and six ancilla photons from SPDC. The rest of the configuration matches the suggestion’s parameters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. To fix this, I explicitly separate input and output modes: the first five modes (0–4) are inputs, the next five (5–9) are outputs, and the six ancilla photons occupy modes 10–15 (implicit). I recast the eight successful herald events as basis mappings in the 10-bit target_quantum strings (5 input bits + 5 output bits) and set heralding_out=true so only ancillas are detected.

Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stems from assigning the control photon (an incoming qubit) as a single-photon emitter source. In Pytheus, single_emitters must be disjoint from in_nodes. Here the control qubit is an input, not an ancilla source—so it must be removed from single_emitters. I will clear single_emitters, keep the SPDC ancillas implicit in num_anc, and resubmit the configuration unchanged otherwise.
