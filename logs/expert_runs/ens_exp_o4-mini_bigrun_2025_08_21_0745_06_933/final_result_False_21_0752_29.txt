}###Title:  
Teleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  

Mini-abstract:  
We propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder’s flat-band topological phase transition.
