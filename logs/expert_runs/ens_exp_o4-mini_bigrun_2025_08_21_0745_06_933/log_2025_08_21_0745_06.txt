    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:  \nPhoton-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router for High-Rate QKD\n\nGoal:  \nBuild a single static linear-optical node that, given an incoming \u201cdata\u201d qubit (mode V) and two SPDC-generated entanglement-half photons (one from Alice\u2013Charlie link, one from Bob\u2013Charlie link), uses photon-number filtering (PNS) plus a tailored linear-optical multiport measurement to teleport the data qubit either to Alice or to Bob in one heralded step\u2014thereby routing every successful herald into key generation for one of two users, doubling the per-pulse key throughput.\n\nNetwork layout:  \n \u2022 Alice\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_A emits (A\u2081 \u2013 C\u2081); Alice keeps A\u2081, C\u2081 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_B emits (C\u2082 \u2013 B\u2081); Bob keeps B\u2081, C\u2082 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Incoming data qubit mode V (e.g. from Victor) enters router\u2019s third input.\n\nRouter architecture at Charlie:  \n1. PNS Filtering Stage  \n   \u2013 Modes V, C\u2081, C\u2082 each pass through a low-reflectivity beam splitter feeding a number-resolving detector.  \n   \u2013 Post-select exactly one photon in each PNS detector (\u201csingle-photon herald\u201d) \u2192 removes vacuum/multi-photon noise in one go.\n\n2. Teleportation-Routing Multiport  \n   \u2013 The three herald-filtered photons enter a custom 3\u00d73 linear-optical interferometer (unitary U optimized by Pytheus).  \n   \u2013 Its three output ports are monitored by number-resolving detectors. Two of these detectors click in coincidence, yielding one of two distinct \u201cBell-swap\u201d patterns:  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b1 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto A\u2081 (Alice).  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b2 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto B\u2081 (Bob).\n\n3. Heralding & Key Extraction  \n   \u2013 Herald = (three PNS single-photon clicks) + (either \u03b1 or \u03b2 two-click multiport signature).  \n   \u2013 If \u03b1 \u2192 Alice\u2019s mode A\u2081 now holds the teleported data qubit \u2192 she and Victor can extract one key bit.  \n     If \u03b2 \u2192 Bob\u2019s mode B\u2081 holds the qubit \u2192 he and Victor extract one key bit.  \n   \u2013 Every heralded event yields exactly one key bit, and routing splits them between Alice and Bob in real time, doubling the overall key throughput per data-pulse train versus a single-link teleportation.\n\nPytheus-compatible configuration hints:  \n \u2022 probabilistic pair sources: S_A, S_B (no single_emitters).  \n \u2022 num_anc: 5 (3 PNS detectors + 2 multiport herald detectors).  \n \u2022 number_resolving: True (to enforce exact single-photon filtering and resolve the two-click teleportation outcomes).  \n \u2022 removed_connections: block cross-couplings so that mode V only reaches its PNS splitter and intended multiport inputs.  \n \u2022 heralding_out: list of the three PNS clicks plus the two specific multiport detectors corresponding to \u03b1 and \u03b2 patterns.  \n \u2022 target_quantum: two conditional teleportation maps, encoded as projection patterns\u2014e.g. ['0V\u2192A','1V\u2192A'] for \u03b1 and ['0V\u2192B','1V\u2192B'] for \u03b2.  \n   (In practice, Pytheus will optimize U to maximize correlation between input qubit occupation in V and output in A\u2081 or B\u2081 conditioned on \u03b1 or \u03b2.)  \n\nWhy it\u2019s novel:  \n \u2022 Introduces the first static \u201cteleportation router\u201d measurement, combining photon-number splitting (active decoy-style filtering) and a reconfigurable Bell-swap into one multiport circuit.  \n \u2022 It\u2019s a single joint measurement supermap that simultaneously purifies (filters) and teleports a qubit to one of two endpoints, instead of back-to-back parity check plus separate swaps.  \n \u2022 Directly targets high key rate by guaranteeing every successful herald yields one bit to either user, doubling throughput over a single-link teleportation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible in Pytheus:  \n \u2022 Only uses probabilistic SPDC pair sources, linear optics (beam splitters, a 3\u00d73 interferometer), photon-number-resolving detectors, and heralding\u2014no cavities, no dynamic feedback, no hyper-entanglement.  \n \u2022 Fits Pytheus\u2019s abstract state model (fock-basis mapping) and heralded measurement optimization.  \n \u2022 The target is a network measurement/teleportation primitive, not forbidden state generation.\n\nThis Photon-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router defines a brand-new quantum-network primitive for high-rate QKD, fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities, and readily generalizable to more users and higher dimensions.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:  \nPhoton-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router for High-Rate QKD\n\nGoal:  \nBuild a single static linear-optical node that, given an incoming \u201cdata\u201d qubit (mode V) and two SPDC-generated entanglement-half photons (one from Alice\u2013Charlie link, one from Bob\u2013Charlie link), uses photon-number filtering (PNS) plus a tailored linear-optical multiport measurement to teleport the data qubit either to Alice or to Bob in one heralded step\u2014thereby routing every successful herald into key generation for one of two users, doubling the per-pulse key throughput.\n\nNetwork layout:  \n \u2022 Alice\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_A emits (A\u2081 \u2013 C\u2081); Alice keeps A\u2081, C\u2081 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_B emits (C\u2082 \u2013 B\u2081); Bob keeps B\u2081, C\u2082 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Incoming data qubit mode V (e.g. from Victor) enters router\u2019s third input.\n\nRouter architecture at Charlie:  \n1.

Teleportation-Routing Multiport  \n   \u2013 The three herald-filtered photons enter a custom 3\u00d73 linear-optical interferometer (unitary U optimized by Pytheus).  \n   \u2013 Its three output ports are monitored by number-resolving detectors. Two of these detectors click in coincidence, yielding one of two distinct \u201cBell-swap\u201d patterns:  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b1 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto A\u2081 (Alice).  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b2 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto B\u2081 (Bob).\n\n3.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:  \nPhoton-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router for High-Rate QKD\n\nGoal:  \nBuild a single static linear-optical node that, given an incoming \u201cdata\u201d qubit (mode V) and two SPDC-generated entanglement-half photons (one from Alice\u2013Charlie link, one from Bob\u2013Charlie link), uses photon-number filtering (PNS) plus a tailored linear-optical multiport measurement to teleport the data qubit either to Alice or to Bob in one heralded step\u2014thereby routing every successful herald into key generation for one of two users, doubling the per-pulse key throughput.\n\nNetwork layout:  \n \u2022 Alice\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_A emits (A\u2081 \u2013 C\u2081); Alice keeps A\u2081, C\u2081 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_B emits (C\u2082 \u2013 B\u2081); Bob keeps B\u2081, C\u2082 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Incoming data qubit mode V (e.g. from Victor) enters router\u2019s third input.\n\nRouter architecture at Charlie:  \n1. PNS Filtering Stage  \n   \u2013 Modes V, C\u2081, C\u2082 each pass through a low-reflectivity beam splitter feeding a number-resolving detector.  \n   \u2013 Post-select exactly one photon in each PNS detector (\u201csingle-photon herald\u201d) \u2192 removes vacuum/multi-photon noise in one go.\n\n2. Teleportation-Routing Multiport  \n   \u2013 The three herald-filtered photons enter a custom 3\u00d73 linear-optical interferometer (unitary U optimized by Pytheus).  \n   \u2013 Its three output ports are monitored by number-resolving detectors. Two of these detectors click in coincidence, yielding one of two distinct \u201cBell-swap\u201d patterns:  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b1 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto A\u2081 (Alice).  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b2 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto B\u2081 (Bob).\n\n3. Heralding & Key Extraction  \n   \u2013 Herald = (three PNS single-photon clicks) + (either \u03b1 or \u03b2 two-click multiport signature).  \n   \u2013 If \u03b1 \u2192 Alice\u2019s mode A\u2081 now holds the teleported data qubit \u2192 she and Victor can extract one key bit.  \n     If \u03b2 \u2192 Bob\u2019s mode B\u2081 holds the qubit \u2192 he and Victor extract one key bit.  \n   \u2013 Every heralded event yields exactly one key bit, and routing splits them between Alice and Bob in real time, doubling the overall key throughput per data-pulse train versus a single-link teleportation.\n\nPytheus-compatible configuration hints:  \n \u2022 probabilistic pair sources: S_A, S_B (no single_emitters).  \n \u2022 num_anc: 5 (3 PNS detectors + 2 multiport herald detectors).  \n \u2022 number_resolving: True (to enforce exact single-photon filtering and resolve the two-click teleportation outcomes).  \n \u2022 removed_connections: block cross-couplings so that mode V only reaches its PNS splitter and intended multiport inputs.  \n \u2022 heralding_out: list of the three PNS clicks plus the two specific multiport detectors corresponding to \u03b1 and \u03b2 patterns.  \n \u2022 target_quantum: two conditional teleportation maps, encoded as projection patterns\u2014e.g. ['0V\u2192A','1V\u2192A'] for \u03b1 and ['0V\u2192B','1V\u2192B'] for \u03b2.  \n   (In practice, Pytheus will optimize U to maximize correlation between input qubit occupation in V and output in A\u2081 or B\u2081 conditioned on \u03b1 or \u03b2.)  \n\nWhy it\u2019s novel:  \n \u2022 Introduces the first static \u201cteleportation router\u201d measurement, combining photon-number splitting (active decoy-style filtering) and a reconfigurable Bell-swap into one multiport circuit.  \n \u2022 It\u2019s a single joint measurement supermap that simultaneously purifies (filters) and teleports a qubit to one of two endpoints, instead of back-to-back parity check plus separate swaps.  \n \u2022 Directly targets high key rate by guaranteeing every successful herald yields one bit to either user, doubling throughput over a single-link teleportation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible in Pytheus:  \n \u2022 Only uses probabilistic SPDC pair sources, linear optics (beam splitters, a 3\u00d73 interferometer), photon-number-resolving detectors, and heralding\u2014no cavities, no dynamic feedback, no hyper-entanglement.  \n \u2022 Fits Pytheus\u2019s abstract state model (fock-basis mapping) and heralded measurement optimization.  \n \u2022 The target is a network measurement/teleportation primitive, not forbidden state generation.\n\nThis Photon-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router defines a brand-new quantum-network primitive for high-rate QKD, fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities, and readily generalizable to more users and higher dimensions.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I have assembled a Pytheus configuration reflecting the teleportation-router measurement with five ancilla detectors (three PNS plus two multiport herald detectors), dual probabilistic SPDC sources, number-resolving detectors, and the dual-rail teleportation targets '10' and '01' on output modes A\u2081 and B\u2081.

Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot24_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(2,4) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a four-dimensional photon.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 4) to the mode of the target photon.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n   \"0000\" means |00> \u2192 |00>  \\n   \"0101\" means |01> \u2192 |01>  \\n   \"0202\" means |02> \u2192 |02>  \\n   \"0303\" means |03> \u2192 |03>  \\n   \"1011\" means |10> \u2192 |11>  \\n   \"1112\" means |11> \u2192 |12>  \\n   \"1213\" means |12> \u2192 |13>  \\n   \"1310\" means |13> \u2192 |10>  \\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:  \nPhoton-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router for High-Rate QKD\n\nGoal:  \nBuild a single static linear-optical node that, given an incoming \u201cdata\u201d qubit (mode V) and two SPDC-generated entanglement-half photons (one from Alice\u2013Charlie link, one from Bob\u2013Charlie link), uses photon-number filtering (PNS) plus a tailored linear-optical multiport measurement to teleport the data qubit either to Alice or to Bob in one heralded step\u2014thereby routing every successful herald into key generation for one of two users, doubling the per-pulse key throughput.\n\nNetwork layout:  \n \u2022 Alice\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_A emits (A\u2081 \u2013 C\u2081); Alice keeps A\u2081, C\u2081 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_B emits (C\u2082 \u2013 B\u2081); Bob keeps B\u2081, C\u2082 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Incoming data qubit mode V (e.g. from Victor) enters router\u2019s third input.\n\nRouter architecture at Charlie:  \n1. PNS Filtering Stage  \n   \u2013 Modes V, C\u2081, C\u2082 each pass through a low-reflectivity beam splitter feeding a number-resolving detector.  \n   \u2013 Post-select exactly one photon in each PNS detector (\u201csingle-photon herald\u201d) \u2192 removes vacuum/multi-photon noise in one go.\n\n2. Teleportation-Routing Multiport  \n   \u2013 The three herald-filtered photons enter a custom 3\u00d73 linear-optical interferometer (unitary U optimized by Pytheus).  \n   \u2013 Its three output ports are monitored by number-resolving detectors. Two of these detectors click in coincidence, yielding one of two distinct \u201cBell-swap\u201d patterns:  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b1 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto A\u2081 (Alice).  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b2 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto B\u2081 (Bob).\n\n3. Heralding & Key Extraction  \n   \u2013 Herald = (three PNS single-photon clicks) + (either \u03b1 or \u03b2 two-click multiport signature).  \n   \u2013 If \u03b1 \u2192 Alice\u2019s mode A\u2081 now holds the teleported data qubit \u2192 she and Victor can extract one key bit.  \n     If \u03b2 \u2192 Bob\u2019s mode B\u2081 holds the qubit \u2192 he and Victor extract one key bit.  \n   \u2013 Every heralded event yields exactly one key bit, and routing splits them between Alice and Bob in real time, doubling the overall key throughput per data-pulse train versus a single-link teleportation.\n\nPytheus-compatible configuration hints:  \n \u2022 probabilistic pair sources: S_A, S_B (no single_emitters).  \n \u2022 num_anc: 5 (3 PNS detectors + 2 multiport herald detectors).  \n \u2022 number_resolving: True (to enforce exact single-photon filtering and resolve the two-click teleportation outcomes).  \n \u2022 removed_connections: block cross-couplings so that mode V only reaches its PNS splitter and intended multiport inputs.  \n \u2022 heralding_out: list of the three PNS clicks plus the two specific multiport detectors corresponding to \u03b1 and \u03b2 patterns.  \n \u2022 target_quantum: two conditional teleportation maps, encoded as projection patterns\u2014e.g. ['0V\u2192A','1V\u2192A'] for \u03b1 and ['0V\u2192B','1V\u2192B'] for \u03b2.  \n   (In practice, Pytheus will optimize U to maximize correlation between input qubit occupation in V and output in A\u2081 or B\u2081 conditioned on \u03b1 or \u03b2.)  \n\nWhy it\u2019s novel:  \n \u2022 Introduces the first static \u201cteleportation router\u201d measurement, combining photon-number splitting (active decoy-style filtering) and a reconfigurable Bell-swap into one multiport circuit.  \n \u2022 It\u2019s a single joint measurement supermap that simultaneously purifies (filters) and teleports a qubit to one of two endpoints, instead of back-to-back parity check plus separate swaps.  \n \u2022 Directly targets high key rate by guaranteeing every successful herald yields one bit to either user, doubling throughput over a single-link teleportation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible in Pytheus:  \n \u2022 Only uses probabilistic SPDC pair sources, linear optics (beam splitters, a 3\u00d73 interferometer), photon-number-resolving detectors, and heralding\u2014no cavities, no dynamic feedback, no hyper-entanglement.  \n \u2022 Fits Pytheus\u2019s abstract state model (fock-basis mapping) and heralded measurement optimization.  \n \u2022 The target is a network measurement/teleportation primitive, not forbidden state generation.\n\nThis Photon-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router defines a brand-new quantum-network primitive for high-rate QKD, fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities, and readily generalizable to more users and higher dimensions.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I have assembled a Pytheus configuration reflecting the teleportation-router measurement with five ancilla detectors (three PNS plus two multiport herald detectors), dual probabilistic SPDC sources, number-resolving detectors, and the dual-rail teleportation targets '10' and '01' on output modes A\u2081 and B\u2081.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nDescription:  \nPhoton-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router for High-Rate QKD\n\nGoal:  \nBuild a single static linear-optical node that, given an incoming \u201cdata\u201d qubit (mode V) and two SPDC-generated entanglement-half photons (one from Alice\u2013Charlie link, one from Bob\u2013Charlie link), uses photon-number filtering (PNS) plus a tailored linear-optical multiport measurement to teleport the data qubit either to Alice or to Bob in one heralded step\u2014thereby routing every successful herald into key generation for one of two users, doubling the per-pulse key throughput.\n\nNetwork layout:  \n \u2022 Alice\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_A emits (A\u2081 \u2013 C\u2081); Alice keeps A\u2081, C\u2081 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2013Charlie SPDC source S_B emits (C\u2082 \u2013 B\u2081); Bob keeps B\u2081, C\u2082 \u2192 router.  \n \u2022 Incoming data qubit mode V (e.g. from Victor) enters router\u2019s third input.\n\nRouter architecture at Charlie:  \n1.

Teleportation-Routing Multiport  \n   \u2013 The three herald-filtered photons enter a custom 3\u00d73 linear-optical interferometer (unitary U optimized by Pytheus).  \n   \u2013 Its three output ports are monitored by number-resolving detectors. Two of these detectors click in coincidence, yielding one of two distinct \u201cBell-swap\u201d patterns:  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b1 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto A\u2081 (Alice).  \n     \u2022 Pattern \u03b2 \u2192 successful teleportation of V onto B\u2081 (Bob).\n\n3. Heralding & Key Extraction  \n   \u2013 Herald = (three PNS single-photon clicks) + (either \u03b1 or \u03b2 two-click multiport signature).  \n   \u2013 If \u03b1 \u2192 Alice\u2019s mode A\u2081 now holds the teleported data qubit \u2192 she and Victor can extract one key bit.  \n     If \u03b2 \u2192 Bob\u2019s mode B\u2081 holds the qubit \u2192 he and Victor extract one key bit.  \n   \u2013 Every heralded event yields exactly one key bit, and routing splits them between Alice and Bob in real time, doubling the overall key throughput per data-pulse train versus a single-link teleportation.\n\nPytheus-compatible configuration hints:  \n \u2022 probabilistic pair sources: S_A, S_B (no single_emitters).  \n \u2022 num_anc: 5 (3 PNS detectors + 2 multiport herald detectors).  \n \u2022 number_resolving: True (to enforce exact single-photon filtering and resolve the two-click teleportation outcomes).  \n \u2022 removed_connections: block cross-couplings so that mode V only reaches its PNS splitter and intended multiport inputs.  \n \u2022 heralding_out: list of the three PNS clicks plus the two specific multiport detectors corresponding to \u03b1 and \u03b2 patterns.  \n \u2022 target_quantum: two conditional teleportation maps, encoded as projection patterns\u2014e.g. ['0V\u2192A','1V\u2192A'] for \u03b1 and ['0V\u2192B','1V\u2192B'] for \u03b2.  \n   (In practice, Pytheus will optimize U to maximize correlation between input qubit occupation in V and output in A\u2081 or B\u2081 conditioned on \u03b1 or \u03b2.)  \n\nWhy it\u2019s novel:  \n \u2022 Introduces the first static \u201cteleportation router\u201d measurement, combining photon-number splitting (active decoy-style filtering) and a reconfigurable Bell-swap into one multiport circuit.  \n \u2022 It\u2019s a single joint measurement supermap that simultaneously purifies (filters) and teleports a qubit to one of two endpoints, instead of back-to-back parity check plus separate swaps.  \n \u2022 Directly targets high key rate by guaranteeing every successful herald yields one bit to either user, doubling throughput over a single-link teleportation.\n\nWhy it\u2019s feasible in Pytheus:  \n \u2022 Only uses probabilistic SPDC pair sources, linear optics (beam splitters, a 3\u00d73 interferometer), photon-number-resolving detectors, and heralding\u2014no cavities, no dynamic feedback, no hyper-entanglement.  \n \u2022 Fits Pytheus\u2019s abstract state model (fock-basis mapping) and heralded measurement optimization.  \n \u2022 The target is a network measurement/teleportation primitive, not forbidden state generation.\n\nThis Photon-Number-Splitting\u2013Enabled Teleportation Router defines a brand-new quantum-network primitive for high-rate QKD, fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities, and readily generalizable to more users and higher dimensions.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: I have assembled a Pytheus configuration reflecting the teleportation-router measurement with five ancilla detectors (three PNS plus two multiport herald detectors), dual probabilistic SPDC sources, number-resolving detectors, and the dual-rail teleportation targets '10' and '01' on output modes A\u2081 and B\u2081.
