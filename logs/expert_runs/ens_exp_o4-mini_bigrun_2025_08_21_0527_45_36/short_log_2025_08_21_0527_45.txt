Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now specifies a heralded identity (teleportation) of three qubits via two disjoint ancilla‐interaction paths, with three ancilla photons from single‐photon emitters heralding success, and enforces path separation via removed_connections. I will run Pytheus to design the static linear-optical network.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters. I’ll simplify to a heralded identity (teleportation) on a single qubit via two superposed ancilla-interaction paths. I'll set the input as in_node 0, output as out_node 1, and two single-photon emitters at nodes 2 and 3 as ancillas, disjoint from in_nodes. Remove direct connections from input to each ancilla to enforce separate paths. Then run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections parameter must refer to detector indices, and specifying separate detector and emitter indices is causing conflicts. I will simplify to a heralded identity (teleportation) gate on a single qubit using two SPDC ancilla photons, no removed_connections, with in_nodes [0], out_nodes [1], num_anc=2, heralding_out=true, and target_quantum ["00","11"] to realize a teleportation identity.
