}###Title: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(θ)

Abstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(θ) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues μ₁(θ), μ₂(θ) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {μ₁²,μ₂²,2μ₁μ₂,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(θ)’s entangling power.
