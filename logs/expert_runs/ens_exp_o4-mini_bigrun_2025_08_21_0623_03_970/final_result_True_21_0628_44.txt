}###Title: “Heralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP”

Abstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation 
|c⟩₀,₁⊗|d⟩₂,₃ → |c⟩₀,₁⊗(swap_if_c=1 |d⟩₂,₃) 
by implementing a heralded 4×4 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.
