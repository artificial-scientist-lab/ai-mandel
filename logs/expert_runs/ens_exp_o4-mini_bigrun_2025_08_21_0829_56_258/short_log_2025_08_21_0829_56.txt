PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stems from including data modes as out_nodes. This is a pure measurement on the four ancilla photons, so we should set in_nodes to the four ancilla, leave out_nodes empty, and remove anc_detectors. Then retry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The ancilla modes are pure measurement inputs, so we set in_nodes to [0,1,2,3], out_nodes empty, use target_quantum as the two 4-mode click patterns, and match num_anc=4. This gives contiguous nodes 0–3. Proceed with pytheus.
