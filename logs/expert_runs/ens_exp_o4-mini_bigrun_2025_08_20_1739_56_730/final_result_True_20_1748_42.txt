}###Title: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs

Mini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the “middle” modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters—and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector—this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.
