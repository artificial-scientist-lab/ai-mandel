Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The recast task as a heralded six‐photon GHZ₆ generator fits Pytheus’s capabilities. I’ll submit the finalized configuration to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Target state had invalid format and could not be created.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error likely arose from non-monotonic out_nodes and target ordering. I'll simplify by defining GHZ₆ on modes [0–5] with out_nodes sorted and block ancilla→any-output, using target_quantum = ["000000","111111"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The invalid-format error likely stems from incorrectly specifying output modes. For a heralded state generator, list only input (signal) modes under “in_nodes” and leave “out_nodes” empty so Pytheus treats the six-photon GHZ on those modes. I’ll remove out_nodes and keep in_nodes = [0–5].

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The generation problem requires specifying output modes for the six-photon GHZ state, with ancilla-only detection. I'll set in_nodes empty, out_nodes=[0–5], num_anc=2, and block ancilla-to-output paths.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The invalid‐format issue arose because the GHZ₆ superposition is a discrete‐variable qubit state, so we must switch to a fidelity‐based loss ('fid') and supply amplitudes. I’ll submit a DV‐GHZ₆ heralding config with fidelity optimization.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust configuration for a discrete‐variable GHZ₆ via fidelity optimization: use loss_func "fid", boolean imaginary=false, proper thresholds, out_nodes=[0–5], two ancilla clicks heralding, block ancilla→signal paths.
