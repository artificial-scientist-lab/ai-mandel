Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will construct a Pytheus configuration that encodes the three-qubit teleportation as an identity mapping from input modes [0,1,2] to output modes [6,7,8], heralded by six ancilla photons. This preserves the Borromean-loop structure and only allows success on triple-coincidence.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to satisfy Pytheus’s requirement for contiguous node indices by explicitly listing the ancilla photons as single_emitters occupying the missing nodes 3,4,5. I’ll set num_anc=3 to match, map the teleportation as an identity from input nodes [0,1,2] to output nodes [6,7,8], and use a discrete-variable fidelity loss to enforce the phase mapping only in triple-coincidence.
