}###Title: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network

Mini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network—a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (ψA, ψB, ψC) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes φA, φB, and φC. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network’s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(φA+φB+φC)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.
