}###Title:  
One-Shot Two-Hop Entanglement Swap in the A–B_router–C_router–D Quantum Network

Abstract:  
We propose and analyze a one-shot multi-hop entanglement swap that compresses two sequential Bell-pair swaps across the target network A–B_router–C_router–D into a single four-photon joint interference measurement. By heralding one of 16 detector click patterns at a fixed 4-mode interferometer and applying local Pauli corrections, end nodes A and D are projected directly into a maximally entangled Bell state without intermediate feed-forward.
