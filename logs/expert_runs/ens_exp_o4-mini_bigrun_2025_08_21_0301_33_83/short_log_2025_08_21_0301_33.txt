Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I'll run Pytheus for the cylinder boundary experiment to optimize heralded entanglement swapping between nodes 0 and 4 on a 1×4 ladder with periodic (cylinder) boundary conditions.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because for a Fock‐basis target (loss_func 'fockcr') Pytheus expects target_quantum as lists of photon‐number lists, not strings. I need to replace ["10001000"] with [[1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]]. I'll correct that and retry.
