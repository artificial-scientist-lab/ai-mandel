SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the researcher’s hybrid qubit–qutrit entanglement‐swapping protocol: two pair sources on modes (0,1) and (2,3), a full 2×3 Bell measurement on modes 1&2 (ancillas), and post‐selection on the target qubit–qutrit Bell state on modes 0 and 3. Removed connections forbid direct pair sources between 0 and 3. All parameters faithfully reflect the suggestion.
