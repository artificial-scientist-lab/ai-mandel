SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested config accurately captures the heralded asymmetric 1→2 cloner: single emitter at 0, SPDC ancilla at 1,2, two herald detectors, beam-splitter phase parameters optimized via count‐rate, and heralding_out to leave clones undetected. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates single_emitters and in_nodes must be disjoint. The unknown qubit should be an input (in_nodes) and not listed as a single emitter. Removing the single_emitters field resolves this.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket.

There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus cannot find perfect matchings for an odd total photon number. To fix this without changing the researcher's target, we must supply an extra “blank” photon so the total input photon number is even. We introduce a second single‐photon emitter as the blank clone (mode 3), keep the SPDC pair as the two heralded ancilla (modes 1&2), set in_nodes=[0,3], num_anc=2, out_nodes=[0,3] for the two clones, and heralding_out=true to detect only ancillas. This makes total loaded photons = 2 emitters + 2 ancilla = 4 (even), with 2 detections (ancillas) and 2 undetected outputs (the two clones). We then list the two valid Fock transitions for the unknown-photon entering modes 0 and blank-photon at 3 mapping to output clones at 0&3, post-selected on ancilla clicks at 1&2.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust to even total photons by using two input single-photon modes (unknown + blank vacuum), two SPDC ancilla photons, and herald only ancilla detections. Specify a minimal transformation mapping |00>→|00> and |10>→|11> on input→output qubit modes.
