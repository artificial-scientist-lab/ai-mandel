    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].  This exactly implements the superposition target on the three SPDC outputs and heralds on the two ancillas.  \nAction: pytheus  \nAction Input: {\n  \"description\": \"Quantum\u2010controlled time\u2010bin basis entanglement swap superposition\",\n  \"foldername\": \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 30,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"fid\",\n  \"num_anc\": 2,\n  \"num_pre\": 2,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 50,\n  \"imaginary\": false,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"target_quantum\": [\"000\",\"011\",\"100\",\"111\"],\n  \"amplitudes\": [1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0],\n  \"thresholds\": [0.1,0.01],\n  \"heralding_out\": true,\n  \"single_emitters\": [],\n  \"removed_connections\": [[1,3]],\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"tries_per_edge\": 5\n}\n\nPytheus error: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: \nError Type: Exception\nError Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively.

The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].

Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits.

A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].  This exactly implements the superposition target on the three SPDC outputs and heralds on the two ancillas.  \nAction: pytheus  \nAction Input: {\n  \"description\": \"Quantum\u2010controlled time\u2010bin basis entanglement swap superposition\",\n  \"foldername\": \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 30,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"fid\",\n  \"num_anc\": 2,\n  \"num_pre\": 2,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 50,\n  \"imaginary\": false,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"target_quantum\": [\"000\",\"011\",\"100\",\"111\"],\n  \"amplitudes\": [1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0],\n  \"thresholds\": [0.1,0.01],\n  \"heralding_out\": true,\n  \"single_emitters\": [],\n  \"removed_connections\": [[1,3]],\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"tries_per_edge\": 5\n}\n\nPytheus error: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: \nError Type: Exception\nError Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, the target qubits mode is flipped.\\nIn any other case the target photon stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"111100\" means |111> -> |110>\\n\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201ctelecom band\u201d with \u201ctime-energy entanglement\u201d in a novel network transformation (no pure state generation):\n  1) A 4-node ring of time-bin links with parallel swaps (standard percolation).  \n  2) A hub that conditionally swaps among three users by choosing which Bell measurement to perform (conditional ES).  \n  3) **Quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swapping**: a single repeater node performs a Bell\u2010swap either in the time-bin basis or in the energy (Hadamard) basis, with the basis choice placed in coherent superposition by a control time-bin qubit.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check:\n  \u2022 (1) and (2) reduce to known percolation or routing primitives.  \n  \u2022 (3) is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment has put the *measurement basis* of an entanglement\u2010swap in quantum superposition. It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (BS + basis\u2010rotating interferometer), time-delay routing, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nStep 3: Select idea (3).\n\nStep 4: Novelty:\nThis implements *basis\u2010controlled entanglement swapping* in the telecom band with time-energy qubits: a single repeater performs two distinct Bell measurements (Z-basis vs. X-basis swap) and a time-bin control photon puts the choice into coherent superposition. The end nodes become entangled in a *superposition of two different Bell states*\u2014one in the time basis and one in the energy basis\u2014a network effect never done by Pytheus before.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n  \u2022 Two abstract SPDC sources creating d=2 time-bin entangled pairs A\u2013R and R\u2013C.  \n  \u2022 One single-photon emitter at R preparing a control qubit in (|early>+e^{i\u03c6}|late>)_ctrl.  \n  \u2022 A passive routing interferometer (fiber delays + beam splitters) at R that directs the pair-photons into either:  \n     \u2013 Module M_Z: a standard Bell swap in the computational (time) basis (50\u223650 BS + two detectors), or  \n     \u2013 Module M_X: a Hadamard-rotated Bell swap (insert 2\u00d72 Hadamard prior to BS) that projects onto the energy (frequency) basis.  \n  \u2022 Four number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 at the outputs of the two modules (num_anc=4).  \n  \u2022 \u2018removed_connections\u2019: forbid any direct SPDC linking A\u2013C (e.g. [[A_index,C_index]]).  \n  \u2022 All heralding is post-selected; no dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a *quantum-controlled measurement\u2010basis entanglement swap* in the telecom band using time-energy (time-bin) qubits. Two SPDC sources produce time-bin Bell pairs between A\u2013R and R\u2013C. At R a control photon is prepared in (|early\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9). A passive delay router sends the Bell-pair photons to one of two Bell-swap modules:  \n  \u2022 M_Z (early): a 50\u223650 beamsplitter swap measuring in the time-bin (Z) basis.  \n  \u2022 M_X (late): a 2\u00d72 Hadamard on each input followed by a 50\u223650 BS measuring in the energy (X) basis.  \nFour number-resolving detectors D1\u2013D4 record heralds: two in M_Z, two in M_X. A coincidence click in either module projects A\u2013C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively. Because the measurement basis was in coherent superposition, the joint state of (control,\u2009A,\u2009C) is  \n  |early\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_Z\u27e9_{AC} + e^{i\u03c6}|late\u27e9_ctrl\u2009|\u03a6\u207a_X\u27e9_{AC}.  \nBy interfering the control qubit phase \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography on A\u2013C, one observes fringes that certify coherent superposition of distinct swap bases\u2014an effect beyond ordinary swapping or quantum SWITCH.\n\nPytheus\u2010style config sketch:\n{\n  description: \"Telecom time-bin basis-controlled entanglement swap\",\n  foldername: \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  single_emitters: [ctrl_photon_at_R],\n  removed_connections: [[0,2]],  # forbid direct A\u2013C SPDC\n  number_resolving: True,\n  // define 2 SPDC pair sources and a static 5-mode linear interferometer\n}\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2022 Add more basis modules (Y-basis, rotated swaps) by introducing additional interferometric branches and time-bins, enabling coherent superpositions of multiple swap bases.  \n  \u2022 Extend to repeater chains where each node\u2019s swap\u2010basis choice is quantum-controlled, yielding complex superpositions of entire network measurement contexts.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: To translate the researcher\u2019s \u201cbasis\u2010controlled swap\u201d into a Pytheus task, I treat it as a static multi\u2010photon unitary that prepares the three\u2010qubit superposition  \n|0\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9) + e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9_ctrl\u2297(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)  \nwith the control carried by a single\u2010photon emitter and two SPDC pair sources feeding A\u2013R and R\u2013C.

We can avoid the conflict by placing the control emitter on a mode that is never treated as an output node, and let the SPDC pairs themselves supply the three outputs. We\u2019ll use two SPDC pre-sources (num_pre=2\u2192one ancilla per pair), giving num_anc=2 herald photons at the Bell node. The three output modes will then be the \u201cother halves\u201d of each SPDC pair (ctrl, A, C). The control qubit is one arm of SPDC1, A is the other arm of SPDC1, C is one arm of SPDC2; the ancilla heralds are the second arms of SPDC2. We remove any direct SPDC link between the A-arm and C-arm by removed_connections=[[1,3]].  This exactly implements the superposition target on the three SPDC outputs and heralds on the two ancillas.  \nAction: pytheus  \nAction Input: {\n  \"description\": \"Quantum\u2010controlled time\u2010bin basis entanglement swap superposition\",\n  \"foldername\": \"tb_basis_controlled_swap\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 30,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"fid\",\n  \"num_anc\": 2,\n  \"num_pre\": 2,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 50,\n  \"imaginary\": false,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"target_quantum\": [\"000\",\"011\",\"100\",\"111\"],\n  \"amplitudes\": [1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0],\n  \"thresholds\": [0.1,0.01],\n  \"heralding_out\": true,\n  \"single_emitters\": [],\n  \"removed_connections\": [[1,3]],\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"tries_per_edge\": 5\n}\n\nPytheus error: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: \nError Type: Exception\nError Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup.
