Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Translating the temporal‐mode multiplexing proposal into a static linear‐optical measurement config for Pytheus. I treat the eight detector modes (4 detectors × 2 time bins) as an 8-mode Fock measurement and target eight two-click patterns (four in t₁ and four in t₂). I specify the unknown qubit inputs at modes 0,1 (t₁) and 4,5 (t₂), count‐rate loss in the Fock basis, two ancilla photons reused via a delay loop (implicit), and eight total detector modes.
