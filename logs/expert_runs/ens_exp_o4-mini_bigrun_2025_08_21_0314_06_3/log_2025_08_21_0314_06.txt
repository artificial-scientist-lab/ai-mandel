    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping).

The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\n\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot33_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected CNOT(3,3) gate, which means that we have a control qutrit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\nIf the control qutrit is in mode 2, we add 2 (mod 3) to the mode of the target qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n    \"2022\" means |20> --> |22>\\n    \"2120\" means |21> --> |20>\\n    \"2221\" means |22> --> |21>\\n\\nThis transformation requires five ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qutrit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps][8 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 3 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to fuse \u201cwaveguide lattice\u201d and \u201ctopological photonics\u201d into a quantum-network target (no forbidden state generation):\n    1. A multi-hop entanglement-swapping chain running strictly along the chiral edge of a 2D Chern-insulator\u2013type waveguide lattice, distributing entanglement between two distant edge nodes.\n    2. A Bell-measurement interferometer that splits the teleportation channel around two different topological edge paths of an Haldane lattice and recombines at the receiver to extract a geometric (Chern) phase.\n    3. An SSH-chain \u201centanglement pump\u201d that cyclically swaps a qubit around a 1D topological lattice, diagnosing its winding number by ancilla-cost and success probability.\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    1. Not done before in Pytheus; pure network transformation (entanglement swapping chain), static linear optics, only abstract modes & Bell measurements, no state generation.  \n    2. Requires coherent two-path recombination\u2014borderline for Pytheus\u2019s static postselection.  \n    3. Closely mirrors past \u201cFloquet pump\u201d suggestions; less novel.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising.\n  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first explicit proposal for a chiral-edge, topologically protected, multi-hop entanglement distribution protocol in an abstract photonic network. It tests robustness of quantum entanglement distribution against bulk defects by strictly forcing ancilla swaps along the one-way edge.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: Pytheus can optimize a static linear-optical network of Bell-pair sources and beam-splitters plus photon-number\u2013resolving detectors implementing the sequential Bell measurements (entanglement swapping). The \u201ctopological lattice\u201d enters only as forbidden/allowed connections among abstract modes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is our proposed Pytheus target\u2014\u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe consider four parties A, B, C, D placed at four sites along the chiral edge of a 2D photonic waveguide lattice engineered to realize a nontrivial Chern band. The goal is to distribute high-fidelity entanglement between two non-adjacent parties (e.g., A and C) by performing sequential entanglement-swapping (Bell measurements) at the intermediate nodes B and D. Crucially, all ancilla photons and Bell-pair sources are forced to propagate only along the topologically protected one-way edge modes, making the protocol robust against static defects or disorder in the bulk. We do not generate any pre-specified multi-photon state; instead, we implement a quantum-network transformation\u2014entanglement chain swapping\u2014whose success probability and resulting entanglement fidelity diagnose the topological protection of the edge.\n\nConceptual layout (modes labeled 0\u2192A, 1\u2192B, 2\u2192C, 3\u2192D along the chiral edge):\n  \u2013 Bell-pair sources between (0\u20131) and (2\u20133), placed on the allowed \u201cedge\u201d bonds only.  \n  \u2013 A and C: output modes where entanglement is to be established.  \n  \u2013 B and D: ancilla nodes where Bell measurements are performed, each mixing one half of an incoming Bell pair with the swapped photon from the previous hop.  \n  \u2013 Two sequential swaps: first entangle A\u2013B, then swap B\u2013C, or equivalently A\u2013B and C\u2013D then swap at B and D in parallel.\n\nKey Pytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Chiral-edge multi-hop entanglement swapping on a Chern lattice\",\n  foldername: \"Chern_edge_swap\",\n  in_nodes: [],  \n  out_nodes: [0,2],                             # A and C\n  num_anc: 2,                                  # two Bell\u2013pair sources\n  anc_detectors: [[joint at 1], [joint at 3]], # Bell-measure modules at B and D\n  removed_connections: [                       # forbid any ancilla/bond in the bulk or backwards\n    [0,3], [1,2], [1,0], [2,1], [2,3], [3,2]\n  ],\n  target_metric: \"maximize_entanglement_fidelity\",  # not a fixed state, but a channel fidelity criterion\n  loss_func: \"1 \u2013 concurrence(out 0\u20132)\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 50,\n  samples: 20,\n  number_resolving: True,\n  imaginary: False\n}\n\nGeneralization and Impact:\n \u2013 One can vary the Chern number by changing which edge bonds are \u201callowed\u201d vs. \u201cremoved,\u201d then track how swapping success and fidelity scale with disorder injected into the bulk connectivity.  \n \u2013 Extend to multi-party cluster distribution by adding extra edge nodes and sequential swapping modules, exploring topologically protected quantum networks in two dimensions.  \n \u2013 Test robustness of high-dimensional (qutrit) entanglement chains by elevating the local Hilbert spaces and repeating along multiple chiral edges.\n\nThis target stays fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities (static linear-optical network design, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, post-selected Bell measurements) and focuses on an entanglement-swapping network\u2014no forbidden state generation\u2014while meaningfully employing waveguide-lattice topology and photonic Chern phases.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: We translate the conceptual \u201cchiral\u2010edge multi\u2010hop entanglement swapping\u201d into a static, heralded Pytheus state\u2010generation problem.
