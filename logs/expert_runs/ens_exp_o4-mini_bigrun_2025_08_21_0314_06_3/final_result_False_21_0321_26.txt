Chiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice

Abstract:  
The target “Chiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice” implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.
