Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the researcher’s proposal, encoding three SPDC sources, directional connectivity via removed_connections, and a central heralded ancilla for the Mott‐blockade. I will now run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity error arose because with 2 main detectors and 3 ancilla detectors we had an odd total of 5 detectors, making perfect matchings impossible.  We need an even number of total detections.  By moving to 6 ancilla photons (and thus 6 ancilla detectors) and explicitly marking [0,1] as the only output modes, we have 8 detectors in total (even) so perfect matchings exist.  I will set num_anc=6 and out_nodes=[0,1], keep the skin‐effect removal between Alice and Bob ([0,1]), and keep heralding on all ancilla detectors to simulate the Mott blockade.  Let's rerun with this corrected parity.
