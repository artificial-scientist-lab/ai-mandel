Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modification misplaced the ancilla detector indices and introduced an invalid field; instead, I’ll keep anc_detectors empty and rely on num_anc=4 to place the four environment detectors. The rest matches the target: two Bell‐pair inputs, swapped outputs on modes 0 and 3, removed cross‐connections, and post‐selection heralding all clicks with heralding_out=false.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because out_nodes overlapped with in_nodes. I will assign the swapped outputs to new, disjoint node indices [4,5] and explicitly list the four environment ancilla detectors at [6,7,8,9].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The experiment is a state‐generation task: we want to produce the swapped Bell state |Φ⁺⟩ on modes A & D (target_quantum ["00","11"]) via linear optics, four ancilla photons (from SPDC), and forbidding any source connecting modes (0,3) or (1,2). We leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty as in other entanglement‐swapping examples.
