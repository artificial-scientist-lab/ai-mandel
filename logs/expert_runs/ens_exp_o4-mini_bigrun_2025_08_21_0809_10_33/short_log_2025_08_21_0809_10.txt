Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now correctly distinguishes the two unknown qubit inputs (from single‐photon emitters) at in_nodes [0,1], the two teleported outputs at out_nodes [2,3], with four SPDC‐pair ancilla photons (num_anc=4) and heralding only on those ancilla‐detector clicks. The target_quantum matches the CNOT truth table on the two data qubits. This setup stays fully faithful to the researcher’s remote‐CNOT teleportation protocol. I will invoke pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I incorrectly labeled the data-qubit inputs as single_emitters. In Pytheus, SPDC ancilla photons are counted by num_anc and managed automatically, while the two unknown qubit inputs should be specified only in in_nodes. I will remove single_emitters and set in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3], keeping num_anc=4.
