Mini-abstract: We implement the target “heralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,” realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD + PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.
