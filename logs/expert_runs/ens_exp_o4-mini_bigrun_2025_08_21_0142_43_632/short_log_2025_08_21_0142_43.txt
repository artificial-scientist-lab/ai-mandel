SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The perceptron AND mapping has been encoded as a post-selected non-linear gate with two input nodes and one output node, using four ancilla photons and heralding to enforce the activation. The configuration matches the suggested modifications and is ready for optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates an odd or mismatched total photon number. Using only two ancilla photons (num_anc=2) ensures an even total (2 inputs + 2 ancilla = 4), so perfect matchings are possible. I’ll reduce num_anc to 2 and increase tries_per_edge and samples for robustness.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus expects target strings spanning input, output, and ancilla detector modes. With 2 ancillas at nodes 3,4, they must click (one photon each), so append '11'. Update target_quantum to ["00011","01011","10011","11111"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to mismatched total photon parity. By reducing to two ancillas, ensuring an even total photon number (2 inputs + 1 output + 2 ancillas = 5 photons? Wait, inputs+ancilla = 4; output is not a node load; output is same photon relocated, so total photon number 4), and correctly formatting target kets to match input/output photon count, the config should now be consistent.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose from an odd total photon number. With 2 inputs + 1 output + 3 ancilla = 6 photons, perfect matchings become possible. Update num_anc to 3 and retry the DV mapping with target kets of length 3.
