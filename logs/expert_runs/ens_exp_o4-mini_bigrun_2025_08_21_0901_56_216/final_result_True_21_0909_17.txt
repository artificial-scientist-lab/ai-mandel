}###Title: Measuring the Quantum Spin–Hall Z₂ Invariant via SSH-Ladder Teleportation

Mini-Abstract: We propose an all-photonic implementation of a spinful SSH ladder—two parallel 1D chains encoding spin-up and spin-down channels with alternating strong/weak beam-splitter phases and fixed π/2 spin–orbit couplings—driven by probabilistic Bell-pair sources and ancilla Bell measurements. By teleporting Bell halves from the input to the output nodes, the threshold behavior of end-to-end teleportation fidelities directly reveals the Z₂ topological invariant of the target quantum-spin-Hall band.
