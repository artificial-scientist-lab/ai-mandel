Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I’ve encoded the full ladder geometry, input/output nodes, Bell-pair target, ancilla detectors, and removed all forbidden cross-chain links not part of the SSH+spin–orbit pattern. Now I’ll run Pytheus with this complete configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (10) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because my target strings had length 10 while in_nodes+out_nodes count was 4. I must express the teleportation as a two-qubit transformation: target_quantum of length 4 with in_nodes [0,7] and out_nodes [6,13]. I’ll correct target_quantum and amplitudes accordingly and retry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes weren’t the contiguous 0–3 indices that Pytheus requires for a 2-qubit transformation. I’ll remap so that nodes 0–1 are inputs, 2–3 outputs, and ancilla detectors are nodes 4–13. Removed connections can be left empty for now.
