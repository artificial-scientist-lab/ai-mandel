Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will construct a pytheus configuration that implements the two‐copy Floquet swap‐test coincidence measurement exactly as described: four SPDC sources on modes (0,1),(2,3),(4,5),(6,7), BS layers for U_F repeated k times (left to the optimizer’s topology search), two independent swap tests on subsystem A with ancilla detectors [8,9] and [10,11], heralded by all four ancilla clicks, and forbidding any other SPDC source connections. The config below encodes these constraints and target of four ancilla clicks.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (12) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 8 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because target_quantum length did not match the specified in_nodes/out_nodes. We only want to herald on the four ancilla detectors [8,9,10,11], so set in_nodes to those and define target_quantum=['1111'], with out_nodes empty. This matches 4 target bits = 4 in_nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to mismatched node numbering. We need the total node set to be contiguous 0..11 (8 system inputs + 4 ancilla detectors), and the target ket string must have exactly 12 digits. We want zero photons on the system modes (0–7) and one photon on each ancilla detector (8–11), so the string is “000000001111”. We set in_nodes=[0…7] (the system inputs), out_nodes=[8–11] (the four ancilla detectors), num_anc=4 to generate four ancilla photons, and target_quantum=["000000001111"]. That fixes the indexing bug without altering the experiment’s heralding target.
