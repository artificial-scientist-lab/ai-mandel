Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will invoke pytheus with a configuration that defines six input modes (two weak Bell pairs on A,B and C,D plus one squeezed-reservoir pair on R1,R2), mixes B–R1 and C–R2, post-selects on clicks at modes B and C, and outputs modes A, D, R1, R2 in the four-term target state.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to ensure in_nodes and out_nodes are disjoint, so I’ll designate modes 1 and 2 (B,C) as the heralding in_nodes, and modes 0,3,4,5 (A,D,R1,R2) as the outputs. Then I list the four target mapping strings in the order [B,C,A,D,R1,R2] and invoke pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I’ll relax the restrictions—drop removed_connections, add a few ancilla SPDC pairs, and correctly set in_nodes (modes to be detected) and out_nodes (modes to survive). I’ll supply four mapping strings of length 6 (2 detected modes + 4 kept modes) so pytheus can run without errors.
