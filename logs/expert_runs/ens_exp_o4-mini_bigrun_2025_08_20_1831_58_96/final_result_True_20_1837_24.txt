}###Title:  
Heralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase₃) for Two Qutrits

Mini-Abstract:  
We present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled‐phase gate CPhase₃ across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie’s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map ω^{ij} (with ω = e^{2πi/3}) on the basis states |i⟩ₐ|j⟩ᵦ without any direct A–B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.
