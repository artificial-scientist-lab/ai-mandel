}###Title: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing

Mini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |ψ_out⟩ = |00⟩ + e^{i(φ₁+φ₂+φ₃)}|11⟩. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase φ₁+φ₂+φ₃, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.
