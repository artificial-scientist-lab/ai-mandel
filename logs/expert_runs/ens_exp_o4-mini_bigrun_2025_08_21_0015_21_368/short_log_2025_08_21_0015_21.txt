Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The static superposition target has been corrected with a valid mapping from five inputs to three outputs, no ancillas, and consistent node indexing. We'll call pytheus with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Fixed in_nodes to exclude the single emitter (node 0) so they are disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous configuration wrongly treated this as a transformation with in/out nodes. It’s actually a state‐generation task: we want to herald on four ancilla clicks (num_anc=4) from two SPDC sources and a single emitter at node 0, producing a three‐photon GHZ–like output |0ₚ0ₐ0_d+|1ₚ1ₐ1_d. No in_nodes/out_nodes are needed for state generation. This aligns with other GHZ‐generation examples.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arose because I marked the path qubit as coming from a single-emitter. Instead I should treat all five “noisy” inputs—including the path—uniformly as in_nodes, and drop the single_emitters field. This yields a static mapping of 5 inputs → 3 outputs (with 0 ancilla), realized by postselecting on the remaining modes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To align with Pytheus state‐generation patterns and resolve node‐count conflicts, treat the scheme as heralded GHZ‐style generation of the 3-mode superposition |0ₚ0ₐ0_d⟩+|1ₚ1ₐ1_d⟩. Use one single‐photon emitter plus two SPDC pairs (num_anc=5), herald on four detectors, leave the path, A, and D modes undetected.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s constraints, I treat both the path‐qubit and the two noisy EPR inputs as external in_nodes, use two SPDC ancilla photons (num_anc=2), and map to three new out_nodes. This gives #in_nodes+num_anc–#out_nodes = 5+2–3=4 detectors for heralding the parity checks. The target_quantum strings map the input pattern “00000→000” and “11111→111” in superposition.
