Title:  
Indefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A→D or C→B links, this scheme realizes the first optical “quantum switch” for entanglement purification—targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.
