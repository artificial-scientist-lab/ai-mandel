}###Title: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections

Abstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second Rényi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin–orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with “SYM” vs. “ANTI” click‐pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.
