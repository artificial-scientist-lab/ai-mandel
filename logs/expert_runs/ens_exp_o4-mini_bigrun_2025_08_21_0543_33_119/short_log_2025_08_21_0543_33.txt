Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration omitted the input‐qubit in_nodes and mis‐assigned out_nodes. For a two‐mode teleportation (Bell pair) we need one incoming mode at corner 0 and one outgoing mode at corner 3. I’ll add `"in_nodes":[0]` and change `"out_nodes":[3]` while keeping the rest true to the SSH‐corner teleportation proposal.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mode indices must be contiguous from 0 to N−1 where N equals the length of each target ket (2). I'll map the input corner to mode 0, the output corner to mode 1, and forbid any direct source between them, i.e. removed_connections=[[0,1]].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The missing `tries_per_edge` caused the KeyError. I’ll include it (set to 5) and keep all other config fields faithful to the SSH‐corner teleportation proposal.
