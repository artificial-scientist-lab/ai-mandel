Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects a six-mode Fock transformation with two incoming photons (input qubit in mode 4, ancilla in mode 5), four ancillas added for the two Bell measurements plus ancilla projection, and post-selection on heralding clicks. We target the superposed output photon in mode 0 or 3 by specifying the two Fock strings and equal amplitudes. The removed_connections prevent unwanted direct SPDC links. This is ready to run in Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus expects the total number of modes in the target strings to equal in_nodes+out_nodes. We want a post‐selected measurement: detectors on all six modes, no outputs. So convert into a measurement scheme with in_nodes=[0..5], out_nodes=[].
