Title:  
Heralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement

Mini-abstract:  
We realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning φ on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A’s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C’s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.
