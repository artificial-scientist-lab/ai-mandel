Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will translate the GHZ-based percolation protocol into a valid Pytheus configuration: define 6 modes (0:A, 1:D, 2:B₁, 3:B₂, 4:C₁, 5:C₂), project modes 2–5 in the GHZ basis (in_nodes), leave 0–1 as outputs (out_nodes), target the joint patterns “000000” and “111111,” set num_anc=4 detectors, and enforce removed_connections so each SPDC source only links its intended pair.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections error arose because we referenced nodes not designated as detectors. To fix this, I will explicitly declare modes 2–5 (the GHZ measurement ports) as in_nodes (inputs) and modes 0–1 as out_nodes (surviving photons), then enable heralding only on the ancilla detectors by setting heralding_out to true. The only forbidden common-source link is between detectors 0 and 1, so I'll set removed_connections to [[0,1]].
