Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempt failed due to mismatch in kets/amplitudes for a Fock‐basis loss. We instead treat this as a discrete‐variable heralded state generation: two SPDC pairs for AB (modes 0–1) and CD (2–3) plus a third SPDC as the “squeezed bath” (modes 4–5). We herald on four ancilla detectors (1,2,4,5) and keep modes 0 and 3 as outputs, aiming for the Bell state |00>+|11>. Using loss_func “fid” and fid thresholds.
