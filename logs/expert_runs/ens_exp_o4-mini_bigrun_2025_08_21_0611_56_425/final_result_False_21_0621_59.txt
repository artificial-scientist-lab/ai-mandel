}###Title: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation

Mini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00〉+|11〉 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.
