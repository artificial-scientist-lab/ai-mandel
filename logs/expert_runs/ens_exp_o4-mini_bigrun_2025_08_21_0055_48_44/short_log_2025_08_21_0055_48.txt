PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates the preoptimization couldn’t find a setup under strict removed_connections and missing in_nodes. I’ll explicitly set the four incoming modes, drop removed_connections to relax constraints, and rerun with in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], out_nodes=[0,1], num_anc=2, heralding_out=true.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to define a purely Fock‐based two‐mode Bell‐pair target with 2 ancillas, leave modes 0/1 as unheralded outputs, and only herald the ancillas in modes 2/3. I’ll drop in_nodes and set out_nodes=[0,1], num_anc=2, heralding_out=true, and keep removed_connections to block cross‐talk.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous setup was too constrained with only 2 ancillas and imposed removed_connections; relax by adding one more ancilla and removing cross-talk constraints. Keep out_nodes=[0,1] and herald only ancillas to leave edge modes free.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Use a minimal heralded qubit entanglement‐swap setup without extra topological constraints. Two SPDC sources feed modes (0,2) and (1,3), swap ancillas 2,3 served by two detectors (num_anc=2, heralding_out=true). Remove any direct source feeding both edge modes via removed_connections=[[0,1]]. This matches the ES_246 pattern but for qubits.
