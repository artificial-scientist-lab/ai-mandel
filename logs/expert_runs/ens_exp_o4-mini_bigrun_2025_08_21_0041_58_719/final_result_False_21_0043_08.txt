}###Title: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer

Mini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap—targeting programmable photonic quantum processors—that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4–7), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.
