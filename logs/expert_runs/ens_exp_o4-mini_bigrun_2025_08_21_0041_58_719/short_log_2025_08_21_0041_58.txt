Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The modified configuration defines a heralded identity-on-control mapping, which Pytheus can optimize: it takes three input photons (two SPDC inputs and one single-emitter control), four ancilla detectors heralding success, and leaves the control in mode 3. The `target_quantum` correctly enforces output = input₂. I will run Pytheus with these settings.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arose because we listed the single emitter as both an input and ancilla source. To resolve, I'll model all photons—including the control—as coming from SPDC sources, so remove `single_emitters`. Inputs remain modes 0,1,2; outputs at mode 3; four ancilla photons from two SPDC pairs. This preserves our identity‐on‐control mapping without in_nodes/single_emitters overlap.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections were invalid, so I’ll remove them entirely and rely on default connectivity. This yields a valid heralded mapping with SPDC ancilla photon pairs.
