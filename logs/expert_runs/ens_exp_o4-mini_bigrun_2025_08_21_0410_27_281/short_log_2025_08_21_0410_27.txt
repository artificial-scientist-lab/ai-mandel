Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration captures the requested squeezed‐reservoir‐assisted entanglement swapping: three SPDC sources (six input modes), heralding on four ancilla detectors, and output modes 0 and 3 projected onto a Bell state. We forbid any direct source linking 0 and 3 and 1 and 2. Now run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus demands that the union of in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes be contiguous from 0 up to N−1. We must explicitly list all six input modes in in_nodes. Adding "in_nodes":[0,1,2,3,4,5] will fix the error. Proceed to run with corrected config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because for state-preparation tasks in Pytheus we leave in_nodes and out_nodes empty and let target_quantum define the output modes. Ancilla detectors are implicit via num_anc, so we should remove explicit in_nodes, out_nodes, and anc_detectors.
