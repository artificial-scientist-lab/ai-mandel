PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because Pytheus expects all node indices in in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes to cover a contiguous set from 0 to N–1. To satisfy this, I assign the two end‐node outputs to out_nodes [0,1] and dummy single_emitters for the four ancilla modes [2,3,4,5], ensuring the union spans 0–5. I also set num_anc=4 to match the four measured ancilla photons, and use a Fock‐basis target of [[1,1]] for the two output photons on A and D.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: Target state had invalid format and could not be created.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to using the wrong loss function for a Fock‐state target. I’ll switch to 'fockcr' so that Pytheus treats [[1,1]] as a two‐photon Fock state on modes 0 and 1, and keep nodes 0–5 contiguous with four vacuum ancilla modes as single_emitters.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust to a discrete‐variable target state for a Bell pair on A–D, use loss_func='fid' with target strings ["1010","0101"], set num_anc=6 for the three SPDC pair sources, and leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty to let Pytheus assign all four modes to the target.
