}###Title: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination

Mini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}⟩ cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.
