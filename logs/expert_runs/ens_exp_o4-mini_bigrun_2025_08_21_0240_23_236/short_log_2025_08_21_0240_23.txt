Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration faithfully encodes a static post-selected 4-mode parity measurement on incoming C-modes (0–3), targets the two detection patterns for Z=0, X=0, forbids cross-links between S₂→R₁ and S₁→R₂ via removed_connections, uses 4 ancilla detectors, PNR, and heralding. Ready to run.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections field must only refer to detector nodes, which in a purely post-selected measurement appear as outgoing modes. To avoid the conflict, I will remove the resource constraint from removed_connections (it is not part of the measurement target itself) and proceed with a clean static parity measurement configuration that unambiguously heralds Z=0, X=0.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement config requires one detector per incoming photon, so set num_anc=4, clear resource constraints for now to satisfy tool requirements and then refine.
