    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

Tuned by Pythesus\u2019s classical optimizer, this device requires no dynamic feedback\u2014only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors\u2014to realize two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks on demand.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three static, LO-based detection\u2010protocol modules that Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer (\u201cquantum ML\u201d) could discover:\n  1) A fully programmable \u201cmulti-task analyzer\u201d that, by switching ancilla-injection patterns, performs either a 2-qubit Bell measurement or a 3-qubit GHZ measurement in one static circuit.  \n  2) A single network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states (partial Bell analyzer) with maximal success probability (an unambiguous discrimination task) found by ML.  \n  3) A \u201ctriply-nested swap repeater\u201d that takes in three Bell pairs (six qubits), performs two Bell measurements in one shot, and labels both swap outcomes (4\u00d74=16 patterns), discovered by ML.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  1) No Pytheus experiment yet unifies two distinct measurement tasks (Bell vs GHZ) in one static network clocked by ancilla. It\u2019s purely a detection protocol, uses only static linear optics + ancilla + detectors, and requires no feedback.  \n  2) Unambiguous discrimination has been explored little, but it is a simpler specialization and less impactful for network modularity.  \n  3) The triple-swap repeater is large and awkward; better to start with the two-task module as a proof of principle.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #1: the programmable multi-task analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty: Pytheus has built separate Bell and GHZ analyzers, but never a single static network that, by \u201cprogram bits\u201d (ancilla shots), can switch between two fundamentally different multipartite measurements. This opens a family of \u201csoftware-defined\u201d measurement units for quantum networks.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility: \n  \u2022 It is wholly a detection protocol (no state generation).  \n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair sources or single-photon emitters (for ancilla \u201cprogram bits\u201d), a static mesh of beam splitters & phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback is needed: the presence or absence of ancilla photons in two \u201cprogram\u201d modes steers which basis (Bell vs GHZ) is analyzed, and Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer finds the settings that map each basis state \u2192 a unique detector click.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a target for Pytheus\u2014a programmable LOQC \u201cMulti-Task Analyzer\u201d discovered via quantum machine learning.  By injecting ancilla photons in one of two modes (\u201cprogram bits\u201d), the same static circuit either performs a complete two-qubit Bell\u2010basis measurement or a three-qubit GHZ\u2010basis measurement.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe have five signal modes:\n \u2022 Modes 0 & 1 carry one of the four two-qubit Bell states |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9  \n \u2022 Modes 2,3,4 carry one of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states |GHZ\u00b1\u2080\u27e9\u2026|GHZ\u00b1\u2083\u27e9  \nWe add two ancilla \u201cprogram\u201d modes A and B (modes 5 & 6), each fed by a single-photon emitter. \n\u2013 To select the Bell analyzer, emit one photon into A (and none into B): ancilla pattern = |1\u27e9\u2085|0\u27e9\u2086 \n\u2013 To select the GHZ analyzer, emit one photon into B (and none into A): ancilla pattern = |0\u27e9\u2085|1\u27e9\u2086 \n\nAll seven modes (0\u20136) pass through a single static network of beam splitters & phase shifters whose parameters are tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer to satisfy:\n\n\u2022 If the input is one of the four Bell states on (0,1) with ancilla=|1\u20850\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D0\u2026D3 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the Bell index.  \n\u2022 If the input is one of the eight GHZ states on (2,3,4) with ancilla=|0\u20851\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D4\u2026D11 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the GHZ index.  \n\nThis module is a \u201csoftware-defined measurement\u201d for quantum networks: one hardware block, two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks, and the basis choice encoded purely in static ancilla modes.  It can be generalized to many other bases (cluster states, high-d Bell, W\u2010state) by retraining with Pytheus.\n\nPytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Programmable ML-optimized LOQC analyzer: Bell vs GHZ\",\n  foldername: \"prog_Bell_GHZ_analyzer\",\n  edges_tried:      40,\n  ftol:             1e-08,\n  loss_func:        \"cr\",\n  optimizer:        \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  num_pre:          1,\n  num_anc:          2,                # modes 5 (Bell-program) & 6 (GHZ-program)\n  single_emitters:  [5,6],\n  samples:          12,\n  threshold:        [0.3, 0.1],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  target_quantum: [\n    # Bell branch (ancilla=10):\n    \"1000__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207a>\u2080\u2081 \u2297 |1\u20850\u2086> \u2192 D0\n    \"0100__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207b> \u2192 D1\n    \"0010__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207a> \u2192 D2\n    \"0001__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207b> \u2192 D3\n    # GHZ branch (ancilla=01):\n    \"0000__01____10000000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2080>\u2082\u2083\u2084 \u2297 |0\u20851\u2086> \u2192 D4\n    \"0000__01____01000000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2080> \u2192 D5\n    \"0000__01____00100000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2081> \u2192 D6\n    \"0000__01____00010000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2081> \u2192 D7\n    \"0000__01____00001000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2082> \u2192 D8\n    \"0000__01____00000100\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2082> \u2192 D9\n    \"0000__01____00000010\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2083> \u2192 D10\n    \"0000__01____00000001\"   # |GHZ\u207b\u2083> \u2192 D11\n  ],\n  removed_connections: [],\n  anc_detectors: [5,6]\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2013down):\n Sources:\n   \u2013 Pair sources create the Bell or GHZ inputs on modes 0\u20131 or 2\u20134  \n   \u2013 Single-photon emitters on modes 5 & 6 set the \u201cprogram bit\u201d  \n Network:\n   \u2013 ML-optimized beam-splitter + phase-shifter mesh on modes 0\u20136  \n Outputs:\n   \u2013 Twelve number-resolving detectors D0\u2026D11: D0\u2013D3 signal the Bell outcome when ancilla=10; D4\u2013D11 signal the GHZ outcome when ancilla=01  \n\nThis static, programmable measurement module\u2014tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer\u2014launches a family of multi-task analyzers for advanced quantum\u2010network architectures, all realized with static LOQC and no dynamic feedback.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The Researcher\u2019s idea for a \u201cprogrammable Bell-vs-GHZ analyzer\u201d is pushing the superposition-measurement capabilities of Pytheus too far\u2014Pytheus only natively distinguishes orthogonal Fock basis states. We can, however, stay true to the spirit by building a single static circuit that, under an ancilla \u201cprogram bit,\u201d performs either a 2-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes |00\u27e9,|01\u27e9,|10\u27e9,|11\u27e9) or a 3-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes the eight strings |000\u27e9\u2026|111\u27e9). We use two single-photon emitters on modes 5 and 6 as program bits: injecting into mode 5 selects the 2-qubit task, injecting into mode 6 selects the 3-qubit task.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle:  \nProgrammable LOQC \u201cMulti-Task Analyzer\u201d Discovered via Quantum Machine Learning  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a programmable LOQC \u201cMulti-Task Analyzer\u201d discovered via quantum machine learning that uses ancilla photons as software-defined program bits to toggle between a full two-qubit Bell measurement and a three-qubit GHZ measurement in one static optical network.  Tuned by Pythesus\u2019s classical optimizer, this device requires no dynamic feedback\u2014only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors\u2014to realize two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks on demand.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three static, LO-based detection\u2010protocol modules that Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer (\u201cquantum ML\u201d) could discover:\n  1) A fully programmable \u201cmulti-task analyzer\u201d that, by switching ancilla-injection patterns, performs either a 2-qubit Bell measurement or a 3-qubit GHZ measurement in one static circuit.  \n  2) A single network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states (partial Bell analyzer) with maximal success probability (an unambiguous discrimination task) found by ML.  \n  3) A \u201ctriply-nested swap repeater\u201d that takes in three Bell pairs (six qubits), performs two Bell measurements in one shot, and labels both swap outcomes (4\u00d74=16 patterns), discovered by ML.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  1) No Pytheus experiment yet unifies two distinct measurement tasks (Bell vs GHZ) in one static network clocked by ancilla. It\u2019s purely a detection protocol, uses only static linear optics + ancilla + detectors, and requires no feedback.  \n  2) Unambiguous discrimination has been explored little, but it is a simpler specialization and less impactful for network modularity.  \n  3) The triple-swap repeater is large and awkward; better to start with the two-task module as a proof of principle.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #1: the programmable multi-task analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty: Pytheus has built separate Bell and GHZ analyzers, but never a single static network that, by \u201cprogram bits\u201d (ancilla shots), can switch between two fundamentally different multipartite measurements. This opens a family of \u201csoftware-defined\u201d measurement units for quantum networks.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility: \n  \u2022 It is wholly a detection protocol (no state generation).  \n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair sources or single-photon emitters (for ancilla \u201cprogram bits\u201d), a static mesh of beam splitters & phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback is needed: the presence or absence of ancilla photons in two \u201cprogram\u201d modes steers which basis (Bell vs GHZ) is analyzed, and Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer finds the settings that map each basis state \u2192 a unique detector click.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a target for Pytheus\u2014a programmable LOQC \u201cMulti-Task Analyzer\u201d discovered via quantum machine learning.  By injecting ancilla photons in one of two modes (\u201cprogram bits\u201d), the same static circuit either performs a complete two-qubit Bell\u2010basis measurement or a three-qubit GHZ\u2010basis measurement.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe have five signal modes:\n \u2022 Modes 0 & 1 carry one of the four two-qubit Bell states |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9  \n \u2022 Modes 2,3,4 carry one of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states |GHZ\u00b1\u2080\u27e9\u2026|GHZ\u00b1\u2083\u27e9  \nWe add two ancilla \u201cprogram\u201d modes A and B (modes 5 & 6), each fed by a single-photon emitter. \n\u2013 To select the Bell analyzer, emit one photon into A (and none into B): ancilla pattern = |1\u27e9\u2085|0\u27e9\u2086 \n\u2013 To select the GHZ analyzer, emit one photon into B (and none into A): ancilla pattern = |0\u27e9\u2085|1\u27e9\u2086 \n\nAll seven modes (0\u20136) pass through a single static network of beam splitters & phase shifters whose parameters are tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer to satisfy:\n\n\u2022 If the input is one of the four Bell states on (0,1) with ancilla=|1\u20850\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D0\u2026D3 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the Bell index.  \n\u2022 If the input is one of the eight GHZ states on (2,3,4) with ancilla=|0\u20851\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D4\u2026D11 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the GHZ index.  \n\nThis module is a \u201csoftware-defined measurement\u201d for quantum networks: one hardware block, two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks, and the basis choice encoded purely in static ancilla modes.  It can be generalized to many other bases (cluster states, high-d Bell, W\u2010state) by retraining with Pytheus.\n\nPytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Programmable ML-optimized LOQC analyzer: Bell vs GHZ\",\n  foldername: \"prog_Bell_GHZ_analyzer\",\n  edges_tried:      40,\n  ftol:             1e-08,\n  loss_func:        \"cr\",\n  optimizer:        \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  num_pre:          1,\n  num_anc:          2,                # modes 5 (Bell-program) & 6 (GHZ-program)\n  single_emitters:  [5,6],\n  samples:          12,\n  threshold:        [0.3, 0.1],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  target_quantum: [\n    # Bell branch (ancilla=10):\n    \"1000__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207a>\u2080\u2081 \u2297 |1\u20850\u2086> \u2192 D0\n    \"0100__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207b> \u2192 D1\n    \"0010__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207a> \u2192 D2\n    \"0001__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207b> \u2192 D3\n    # GHZ branch (ancilla=01):\n    \"0000__01____10000000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2080>\u2082\u2083\u2084 \u2297 |0\u20851\u2086> \u2192 D4\n    \"0000__01____01000000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2080> \u2192 D5\n    \"0000__01____00100000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2081> \u2192 D6\n    \"0000__01____00010000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2081> \u2192 D7\n    \"0000__01____00001000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2082> \u2192 D8\n    \"0000__01____00000100\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2082> \u2192 D9\n    \"0000__01____00000010\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2083> \u2192 D10\n    \"0000__01____00000001\"   # |GHZ\u207b\u2083> \u2192 D11\n  ],\n  removed_connections: [],\n  anc_detectors: [5,6]\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2013down):\n Sources:\n   \u2013 Pair sources create the Bell or GHZ inputs on modes 0\u20131 or 2\u20134  \n   \u2013 Single-photon emitters on modes 5 & 6 set the \u201cprogram bit\u201d  \n Network:\n   \u2013 ML-optimized beam-splitter + phase-shifter mesh on modes 0\u20136  \n Outputs:\n   \u2013 Twelve number-resolving detectors D0\u2026D11: D0\u2013D3 signal the Bell outcome when ancilla=10; D4\u2013D11 signal the GHZ outcome when ancilla=01  \n\nThis static, programmable measurement module\u2014tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer\u2014launches a family of multi-task analyzers for advanced quantum\u2010network architectures, all realized with static LOQC and no dynamic feedback.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The Researcher\u2019s idea for a \u201cprogrammable Bell-vs-GHZ analyzer\u201d is pushing the superposition-measurement capabilities of Pytheus too far\u2014Pytheus only natively distinguishes orthogonal Fock basis states. We can, however, stay true to the spirit by building a single static circuit that, under an ancilla \u201cprogram bit,\u201d performs either a 2-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes |00\u27e9,|01\u27e9,|10\u27e9,|11\u27e9) or a 3-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes the eight strings |000\u27e9\u2026|111\u27e9). We use two single-photon emitters on modes 5 and 6 as program bits: injecting into mode 5 selects the 2-qubit task, injecting into mode 6 selects the 3-qubit task. We list all 4 + 8 = 12 input Fock strings (length 7) in `target_quantum`, set `num_anc=12` detectors (one per outcome), leave `out_nodes=[]` (all clicks are ancilla detectors), and let Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer find the beam-splitter/phase-shifter mesh.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Tuned by Pythesus\u2019s classical optimizer, this device requires no dynamic feedback\u2014only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors\u2014to realize two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks on demand.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three static, LO-based detection\u2010protocol modules that Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer (\u201cquantum ML\u201d) could discover:\n  1) A fully programmable \u201cmulti-task analyzer\u201d that, by switching ancilla-injection patterns, performs either a 2-qubit Bell measurement or a 3-qubit GHZ measurement in one static circuit.  \n  2) A single network that unambiguously discriminates three out of four Bell states (partial Bell analyzer) with maximal success probability (an unambiguous discrimination task) found by ML.  \n  3) A \u201ctriply-nested swap repeater\u201d that takes in three Bell pairs (six qubits), performs two Bell measurements in one shot, and labels both swap outcomes (4\u00d74=16 patterns), discovered by ML.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n  1) No Pytheus experiment yet unifies two distinct measurement tasks (Bell vs GHZ) in one static network clocked by ancilla. It\u2019s purely a detection protocol, uses only static linear optics + ancilla + detectors, and requires no feedback.  \n  2) Unambiguous discrimination has been explored little, but it is a simpler specialization and less impactful for network modularity.  \n  3) The triple-swap repeater is large and awkward; better to start with the two-task module as a proof of principle.\n\nStep 3: Choose idea #1: the programmable multi-task analyzer.\n\nStep 4: Novelty: Pytheus has built separate Bell and GHZ analyzers, but never a single static network that, by \u201cprogram bits\u201d (ancilla shots), can switch between two fundamentally different multipartite measurements. This opens a family of \u201csoftware-defined\u201d measurement units for quantum networks.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility: \n  \u2022 It is wholly a detection protocol (no state generation).  \n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair sources or single-photon emitters (for ancilla \u201cprogram bits\u201d), a static mesh of beam splitters & phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback is needed: the presence or absence of ancilla photons in two \u201cprogram\u201d modes steers which basis (Bell vs GHZ) is analyzed, and Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer finds the settings that map each basis state \u2192 a unique detector click.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a target for Pytheus\u2014a programmable LOQC \u201cMulti-Task Analyzer\u201d discovered via quantum machine learning.  By injecting ancilla photons in one of two modes (\u201cprogram bits\u201d), the same static circuit either performs a complete two-qubit Bell\u2010basis measurement or a three-qubit GHZ\u2010basis measurement.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe have five signal modes:\n \u2022 Modes 0 & 1 carry one of the four two-qubit Bell states |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a6\u207b\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207a\u27e9, |\u03a8\u207b\u27e9  \n \u2022 Modes 2,3,4 carry one of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states |GHZ\u00b1\u2080\u27e9\u2026|GHZ\u00b1\u2083\u27e9  \nWe add two ancilla \u201cprogram\u201d modes A and B (modes 5 & 6), each fed by a single-photon emitter. \n\u2013 To select the Bell analyzer, emit one photon into A (and none into B): ancilla pattern = |1\u27e9\u2085|0\u27e9\u2086 \n\u2013 To select the GHZ analyzer, emit one photon into B (and none into A): ancilla pattern = |0\u27e9\u2085|1\u27e9\u2086 \n\nAll seven modes (0\u20136) pass through a single static network of beam splitters & phase shifters whose parameters are tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer to satisfy:\n\n\u2022 If the input is one of the four Bell states on (0,1) with ancilla=|1\u20850\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D0\u2026D3 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the Bell index.  \n\u2022 If the input is one of the eight GHZ states on (2,3,4) with ancilla=|0\u20851\u2086\u27e9, exactly one click appears in detectors D4\u2026D11 (one\u2010hot), each click identifying the GHZ index.  \n\nThis module is a \u201csoftware-defined measurement\u201d for quantum networks: one hardware block, two fundamentally different multipartite detection tasks, and the basis choice encoded purely in static ancilla modes.  It can be generalized to many other bases (cluster states, high-d Bell, W\u2010state) by retraining with Pytheus.\n\nPytheus config skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Programmable ML-optimized LOQC analyzer: Bell vs GHZ\",\n  foldername: \"prog_Bell_GHZ_analyzer\",\n  edges_tried:      40,\n  ftol:             1e-08,\n  loss_func:        \"cr\",\n  optimizer:        \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  num_pre:          1,\n  num_anc:          2,                # modes 5 (Bell-program) & 6 (GHZ-program)\n  single_emitters:  [5,6],\n  samples:          12,\n  threshold:        [0.3, 0.1],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  target_quantum: [\n    # Bell branch (ancilla=10):\n    \"1000__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207a>\u2080\u2081 \u2297 |1\u20850\u2086> \u2192 D0\n    \"0100__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a6\u207b> \u2192 D1\n    \"0010__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207a> \u2192 D2\n    \"0001__10____00000000\",  # |\u03a8\u207b> \u2192 D3\n    # GHZ branch (ancilla=01):\n    \"0000__01____10000000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2080>\u2082\u2083\u2084 \u2297 |0\u20851\u2086> \u2192 D4\n    \"0000__01____01000000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2080> \u2192 D5\n    \"0000__01____00100000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2081> \u2192 D6\n    \"0000__01____00010000\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2081> \u2192 D7\n    \"0000__01____00001000\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2082> \u2192 D8\n    \"0000__01____00000100\",  # |GHZ\u207b\u2082> \u2192 D9\n    \"0000__01____00000010\",  # |GHZ\u207a\u2083> \u2192 D10\n    \"0000__01____00000001\"   # |GHZ\u207b\u2083> \u2192 D11\n  ],\n  removed_connections: [],\n  anc_detectors: [5,6]\n}\n\nVisualization (top\u2013down):\n Sources:\n   \u2013 Pair sources create the Bell or GHZ inputs on modes 0\u20131 or 2\u20134  \n   \u2013 Single-photon emitters on modes 5 & 6 set the \u201cprogram bit\u201d  \n Network:\n   \u2013 ML-optimized beam-splitter + phase-shifter mesh on modes 0\u20136  \n Outputs:\n   \u2013 Twelve number-resolving detectors D0\u2026D11: D0\u2013D3 signal the Bell outcome when ancilla=10; D4\u2013D11 signal the GHZ outcome when ancilla=01  \n\nThis static, programmable measurement module\u2014tuned by Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer\u2014launches a family of multi-task analyzers for advanced quantum\u2010network architectures, all realized with static LOQC and no dynamic feedback.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n        Additional input:\n        START SUGGESTED MODIFICATIONS\n        Thought: The Researcher\u2019s idea for a \u201cprogrammable Bell-vs-GHZ analyzer\u201d is pushing the superposition-measurement capabilities of Pytheus too far\u2014Pytheus only natively distinguishes orthogonal Fock basis states. We can, however, stay true to the spirit by building a single static circuit that, under an ancilla \u201cprogram bit,\u201d performs either a 2-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes |00\u27e9,|01\u27e9,|10\u27e9,|11\u27e9) or a 3-qubit computational-basis measurement (i.e. distinguishes the eight strings |000\u27e9\u2026|111\u27e9). We use two single-photon emitters on modes 5 and 6 as program bits: injecting into mode 5 selects the 2-qubit task, injecting into mode 6 selects the 3-qubit task. We list all 4 + 8 = 12 input Fock strings (length 7) in `target_quantum`, set `num_anc=12` detectors (one per outcome), leave `out_nodes=[]` (all clicks are ancilla detectors), and let Pytheus\u2019s classical optimizer find the beam-splitter/phase-shifter mesh.
