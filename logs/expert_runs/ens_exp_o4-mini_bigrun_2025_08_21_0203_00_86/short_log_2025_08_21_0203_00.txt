Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration aligns with the researcher’s modifications. I will pass the final JSON to Pytheus to search for a static LOQC network that, under ancilla program bits, distinguishes either all 4 two‐qubit computational bits or all 8 three‐qubit computational bits in one mesh.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that ancilla modes (single_emitters) must not overlap with input nodes. I will remove modes 5 and 6 from `in_nodes`, leaving only the signal modes [0–4]. Then retry the configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (7) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 5 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicated my ancilla modes overlapped with the input nodes and mismatched node counts. For a measurement module Pytheus expects all modes (signals + program bits) as input modes and num_anc equal to number of detectors. I will encode the two program patterns directly in the input Fock strings across 7 modes, remove single_emitters, set in_nodes to [0–6], out_nodes empty, num_anc=7 (seven detectors), and list all 12 input patterns in target_quantum.
