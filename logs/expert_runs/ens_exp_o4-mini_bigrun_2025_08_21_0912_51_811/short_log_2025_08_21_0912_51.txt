Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to encode the SPA‐PT supermap as a discrete‐variable transformation on the four input qubits (two copies) to four output qubits (SPA‐PT copy plus CHSH copy), with heralded ancilla detections. We list every input basis of the two copies and map it to two outputs for the first copy (ρ and ρ^{T_B} average) while leaving the second copy intact. We then specify the heralding detectors via num_anc and heralding_out, and use fidelity as the loss function.
