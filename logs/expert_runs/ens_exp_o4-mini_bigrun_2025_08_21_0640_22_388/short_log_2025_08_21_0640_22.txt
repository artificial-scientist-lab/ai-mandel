Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration mirrors the proposed closed-loop teleportation ring with four ancilla Bell measurements, alternating source amplitudes, forbidden shortcuts, and input/output nodes, so Pytheus can optimize the static linear‐optical network to implement the Zak‐phase tomography without altering the target protocol.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that input nodes and single emitters overlapped. Since all ancilla photons come from probabilistic pair sources, we don’t need any single_emitters. Removing that entry keeps the target protocol intact and resolves the conflict.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous input had non-contiguous node indices and overlapping single_emitter. By switching to a qubit‐in‐two‐modes representation (in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3]), specifying the π‐Zak‐phase mapping as a discrete‐variable gate target with amplitudes [1,–1], removing single_emitters, and ensuring the node set {0,1,2,3} is contiguous, we satisfy Pytheus constraints and faithfully encode the closed‐loop teleportation-phase mapping for α=1,β=2 as a proof‐of‐principle.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: thresholds not defined in config file. Please define thresholds as list of floats (length = 2).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The missing thresholds error indicates I need to add a thresholds field. I'll define typical fidelity thresholds [0.1, 1] and ensure node indices are contiguous with no single_emitters. This keeps the dual-rail phase‐gate mapping for |0⟩→|0⟩, |1⟩→–|1⟩ with four ancilla Bell swaps and forbidden shortcuts for the SSH ring intact.
