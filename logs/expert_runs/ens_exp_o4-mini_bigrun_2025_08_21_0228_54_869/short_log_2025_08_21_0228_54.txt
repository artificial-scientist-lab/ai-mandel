Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion calls for implementing a post‐selected linear‐optical teleportation channel protected by a (3,1) entanglement‐assisted error‐detecting code.  We encode the single logical qubit at A, use four Bell‐pair SPDC sources (8 ancilla photons total), perform two preshared Bell measurements (encoding), two swapping Bell measures at B/C, and a final Bell decode at D.  This is a static network with post‐selection only (heralding on all Bell detectors and the ancilla syndrome detectors).  We treat the channel as the identity map on one dual‐rail qubit (“1010” ↔ “0101”) with fidelity optimization.  We forbid any direct SPDC source joining A to D by removing connections between the input modes [0,1] and the output modes [2,3].  Here is the full pytheus config.
