Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modification captures the spirit of a heralded, non-destructive identity channel on two modes via two-mode squeezed ancillas. The configuration follows the Pytheus schema exactly, with two ancilla photons from SPDC, number-resolving detectors, removed cross-connections, and identity mapping on the input modes heralded by the ancilla clicks.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that I omitted the mandatory 'tries_per_edge' parameter, so I will add it with a reasonable default value.
