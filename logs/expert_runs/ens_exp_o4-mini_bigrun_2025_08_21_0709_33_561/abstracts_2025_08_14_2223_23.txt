Title: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping

Mini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(θ) acting on incoming modes B₁, B₂ and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A–C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.
