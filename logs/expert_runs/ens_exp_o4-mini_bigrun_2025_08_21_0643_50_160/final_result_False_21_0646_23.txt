}###Title:  
“GHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity”

Mini-abstract:  
We propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection—mixing Alice’s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob’s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target Ψ_GHZ=|0000⟩+|1111⟩, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.
