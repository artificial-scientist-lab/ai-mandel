Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the proposed integrated purification + swap repeater node for 3-mode repetition codes, with the correct target, modes, ancilla count, and removed connections. I'll run Pytheus with this setup.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because specifying out_nodes with indices beyond the ket length breaks the node-index constraint. For a pure state generation setup, we should omit in_nodes and out_nodes so Pytheus defaults to generating all modes. We'll remove those fields and use removed_connections to forbid direct A–C sources, then rerun.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that with 3 ancilla photons the total photon number (6 main + 3 ancilla = 9) is odd, so Pytheus can't find perfect matchings. Each heralded CNOT block actually requires 2 ancillas, so for 3 parity checks we need 6 ancilla photons. I'll set num_anc to 6 and rerun without explicit in_nodes/out_nodes.
