SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration correctly captures the teleportation‐based mapping of one photon from mode 0 into an equal superposition across modes 1,2,3, with heralding via ancilla detectors and forbidding direct pair sources from 0 to outputs. I will send this to Pytheus as is.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure arose because using only SPDC ancilla (even photons) plus the single input (odd) gives an odd total photon count, preventing perfect matchings. To correct this without altering the target mapping, I’ll switch to single‐photon emitters for the three ancilla photons (instead of SPDC), so num_anc=3 single emitters. This makes the total photons 1(input)+3(ancilla)=4, an even number, enabling a perfect matching while preserving the teleportation target.
