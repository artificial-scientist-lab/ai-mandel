}###Title: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes

Abstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A–B–C–D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation—mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes—in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.
