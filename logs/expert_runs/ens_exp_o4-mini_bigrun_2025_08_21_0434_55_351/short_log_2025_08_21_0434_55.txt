Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to implement the one‐shot two‐hop swap as a heralded generation of the two‐qubit Bell state |Φ⁺〉_{AD} by using three probabilistic EPR‐pair sources feeding six photons, with the four middle photons jointly measured in a 4‐mode interferometer. In Pytheus terms this is a Bell‐state source: target_quantum=['00','11'], with num_anc=4 measured photons, and removed_connections to forbid any single source from feeding both final outputs (indices 4 and 5). We'll use a count‐rate loss (cr) and photon‐number‐resolving detectors.
