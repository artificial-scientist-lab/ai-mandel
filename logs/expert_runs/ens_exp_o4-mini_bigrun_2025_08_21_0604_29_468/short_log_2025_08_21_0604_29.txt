SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s suggestion requires a static, heralded linear‐optics network that cyclically permutes three Bell pairs (modes 0–1,2–3,4–5), mixes the three “middle” modes with two ancilla modes (6,7), and heralds success by detecting exactly one photon in each ancilla. We must encode this with SPDC sources (no single_emitters), specify 8 total modes, block unwanted ancilla→output connections, allow complex phases, and map the four computational‐basis patterns that satisfy d=a, f=c, b=e & ancilla=11. We stick to their skeleton, correct JSON, list the four 10-bit strings (8 data modes + 2 ancilla), set in_nodes, out_nodes, removed_connections, and herald detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure was due to overlapping in_nodes and out_nodes. For state generation we can omit both so they default to all SPDC outputs as sources and only ancilla are measured when heralding_out=true. We’ll use the six-mode discrete‐variable target state (eight strings) from 3pES, block all ancilla↔output connections, allow complex phases, set heralding_out true, and specify ancilla detectors at 6 and 7.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mistake was specifying ancilla in the target strings; Pytheus expects only the data-mode patterns when using heralding. We switch to a six-mode target with eight patterns corresponding to the three Bell pairs AD, CF, EB and use heralding_out=true with ancilla detectors at modes 6 and 7. We block all ancilla→data connections.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to encode this as a 6-to-6 mode heralded transformation with 2 ancilla. For a transformation, target_quantum entries must be 12-bit strings (6 input + 6 output). I list the eight cyclic-pair basis patterns (the three Bell-pair product states) and their six-mode cyclic outputs, then set in_nodes to the six data inputs [0–5], out_nodes to the six data outputs [0,3,2,5,4,1], num_anc=2 with ancilla detectors at [6,7], removed_connections to block ancilla→data mixing, heralding_out=true, imaginary phases allowed, and other parameters as in the skeleton.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirements for a state‐generation task, I’ll treat the cyclic‐shift as preparing the product of three Bell pairs on the permuted mode pairs.  Following the 3pES example, I leave both in_nodes and out_nodes empty, list the eight six‐bit patterns that realize Bell pairs on (0,3), (2,5), (4,1), set num_anc=2 for the two heralding photons, and block any SPDC source from connecting an ancilla mode (6 or 7) to any data detector (0–5) so that only the pairs (6,7) can be produced by SPDC.  Heralding_out=true ensures we detect only ancilla and keep the six data photons.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The cyclic entanglement shifter is most naturally framed as a heralded state‐generation task: we pump SPDC pairs into modes (0,1), (2,3), (4,5) for the three Bell links and two ancilla SPDC pairs for modes (6,7).  We then mix only the “middle” legs {1,2,4} with ancilla {6,7} and condition on exactly one photon click in detectors 6 and 7, preparing the six data photons on modes 0–5 in the cyclically permuted product of Bell pairs on mode pairs (0,3),(2,5),(4,1).  Following the ES_246 template, we leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty, list the eight six‐bit patterns for the three Bell‐pair product state, set num_anc=2, heralding_out=true with anc_detectors=[6,7], block any direct SPDC ancilla→data by removed_connections, allow complex phases, and use number‐resolving detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The errors indicate Pytheus is rejecting our target format. In Pytheus, heralded state‐generation tasks must list pure Fock‐basis strings of length equal to the total number of modes (data+ancilla), and use only ‘0’ and ‘1’ for single photons. For an 8‐mode setup (6 data + 2 ancilla), each target string is 8 bits long. The four valid cyclic‐permutation patterns combined with ancilla=11 are:
  • 00000011  
  • 01100111  
  • 10011011  
  • 11111111  
We’ll supply exactly those 8‐bit strings, set num_anc=2, heralding_out=true, anc_detectors=[6,7], block ancilla→data SPDC via removed_connections, allow complex phases, number_resolving detectors, and leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty for a pure state generation task.

Expert (o4-mini): I’m sorry, but Pytheus cannot realize this “one‐shot, heralded, dissipative cyclic entanglement shifter” as described. The primitive requires a non-unitary, ancilla-conditioned transformation that both post-selects on ancilla clicks and leaves the six data photons intact for further use. Pytheus only supports either (a) fully post-selective measurements that consume all involved photons, or (b) heralded but unitary gate transformations on fixed input→output Hilbert spaces. It cannot design a static linear-optical network that performs a non-trace-preserving map on a subset of modes (the ancillas) while preserving and re-mapping entanglement among the remaining “data” modes without destructive measurement. This falls outside its current capabilities.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The DCES is a heralded 6‐photon state‐generation with two ancilla. We prepare three Bell pairs on mode pairs (0,3),(2,5),(4,1) by listing the eight 6-bit patterns “abcabc” and heralding exactly one click on ancilla detectors 6 and 7. We block any SPDC from ancilla→data modes, allow complex phases, use number‐resolving PNR detectors, and leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty for a state task.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will frame the DCES as a heralded eight‐mode Fock‐state generation with two ancilla photons (modes 6,7). The target manifold consists of four 8‐mode basis states, each with exactly one photon in ancilla (1,1) and the six data modes in one of the cyclically permuted three‐Bell‐pair patterns. I block any direct SPDC from ancilla to data via removed_connections, allow complex phases, use number‐resolving PNR detectors, and set heralding_out=true with anc_detectors=[6,7] for a pure state‐generation task.
