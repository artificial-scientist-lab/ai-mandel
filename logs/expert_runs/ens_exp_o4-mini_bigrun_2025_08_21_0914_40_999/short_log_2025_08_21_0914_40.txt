Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the config so that all five photons (three inputs + two ancillas) exit via ancilla detectors rather than out_nodes by removing single_emitters and increasing num_anc to 5, matching measurement examples.
