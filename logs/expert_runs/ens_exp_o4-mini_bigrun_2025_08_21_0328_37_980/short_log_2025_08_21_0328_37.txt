SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration closely follows the researcher’s GHZ‐basis teleportation suggestion, with two ancilla detectors heralding the four‐photon GHZ projection, forbidding any direct source from inputs to outputs. I will submit this JSON to Pytheus unchanged as the final config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The GHZ projection likely requires more ancillary photons for a successful post‐selected measurement. I will increase num_anc to 4 and set heralding_out=true to leave outputs undetected, matching the GHZ analyzer design.
