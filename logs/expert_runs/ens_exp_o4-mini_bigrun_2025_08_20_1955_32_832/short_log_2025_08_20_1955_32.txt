Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Construct the config for the topological‐phase with a single‐bond defect SSH-inspired entanglement swap, matching the researcher’s sketch exactly, specifying probabilistic pair sources on strong bonds only (via removal_connections), heralded outputs at modes [0,5], ancilla detectors at [1,2,3,4], and incoming on [0–5] with num_anc=4.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to overlapping in_nodes and out_nodes. We actually don’t need to specify any in_nodes for SPDC sources; let’s remove the in_nodes entry (or set it to empty) so only out_nodes=[0,5] remain, fixing the overlap and matching the intended heralded outputs on modes 0 and 5.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The overlap error was due to explicitly defining nodes; instead, leave in_nodes/out_nodes empty to let Pytheus infer modes, and specify ancilla detectors and heralding on ancilla only. Updated config below.
