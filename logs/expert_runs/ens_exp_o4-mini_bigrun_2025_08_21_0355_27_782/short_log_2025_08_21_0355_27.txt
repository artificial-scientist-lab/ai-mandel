SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches a static 6-mode entanglement swapping along a 2×2 topological lattice, with SPDC sources feeding modes 0→4 and 2→5, only nearest-neighbor couplings, forbidden connections removed, and post-selected heralding on detectors 4 and 5 to produce a Bell state ["00","11"] on modes 1 and 3. I will run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous config treated it like a gate but it’s really a heralded Bell-state generation (entanglement swapping). I’ll recast it as a state-generation task on two modes (B and D → nodes 0 and 1), with 2 SPDC sources (4 ancilla photons) and forbid any source feeding both outputs (removed_connections=[[0,1]]), matching the ES_246 template.
