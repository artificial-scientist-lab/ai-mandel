Heralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice

Abstract:  
We implement a purely static linear-optical network—a 2×2 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings—to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.
