}###Title:  
Boundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose a static linear-optical circuit—the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling—that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch’s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an “area law” for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.
