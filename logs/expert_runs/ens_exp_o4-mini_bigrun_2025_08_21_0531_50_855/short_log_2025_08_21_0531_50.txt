Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration matches a measurement-analyzer setup in Pytheus: three signal modes, five detectors (no explicit ancilla sources), targeting input strings with ≥2 zeros. I'll call Pytheus with this config.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous config misused num_anc and omitted num_pre, leading to an odd-mode mismatch. For a 3 + 2 ancilla Bell-pair setup we need num_anc=2 and num_pre=1, giving 5 total modes/detectors matching the 5 output detectors. I'll update those and retry.

We need a two-mode encoding per qubit (one photon per qubit) giving six input modes plus two ancilla photons from one SPDC. This yields eight total nodes and eight detectors. The target kets are the six-bit Fock patterns for the four basis states with ≥2 zeros. All nodes are contiguous (0–7).
