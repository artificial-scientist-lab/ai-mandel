}###Title:  
Non‐Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the “majority-0” subspace (target click patterns P₀ corresponding to ≥2 spins in |0⟩) or onto the “majority-1” subspace (P₁ for ≥2 in |1⟩). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.
