Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need a Pytheus measurement configuration matching the "4-site OTOC Interferometer" idea. This is a heralded eight-photon measurement: four “atom” single-photon emitters and four SPDC ancillas. We maximize the count rate (“cr”) for the detection pattern with all four atom photons detected and zero clicks on the four ancilla detectors—i.e. the target pattern "11110000". We'll specify num_anc=4, single_emitters on modes [0,1,2,3], number_resolving detectors, and no forbidden connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error arose because out_nodes default overlapped with single_emitters. Measurement schemes treat all photons as “in_nodes” and no single_emitters. We’ll recast as a measurement config: 8 detectors measuring 8 modes, with target pattern of all clicks (“11111111”), num_anc=8.
