Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will encode the SWAP operator on two qubit registers (N=1) as a discrete-variable transformation in Pytheus, using two incoming nodes (the two copies), two outgoing nodes (the swapped copies), and four ancilla photons from SPDC sources. I forbid any direct SPDC source connecting the two data registers via removed_connections [[0,1]]. This configuration stays true to enacting the global SWAP via entanglement swapping modules.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections must reference detector nodes (out_nodes or anc_detectors), not in_nodes. To forbid direct SPDC between the two data outputs, change removed_connections to [[2,3]] so it applies to the output detectors 2 and 3.
