Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Measurement configurations in Pytheus treat `num_anc` as the total number of detectors, and `in_nodes` lists all input modes (including ancilla photons). We must encode the two ancilla photons as additional input modes with zero occupancy in the `target_quantum` strings. This ensures an even total photon number (5 modes → 2 patterns of 5 photons) and satisfies the matching requirements.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy the perfect-matching requirement, use only single-photon emitters for the five ancillas and no SPDC sources. This gives 3 input + 5 ancilla = 8 total photons (even) and no out_nodes so all are detected, letting Pytheus find a 5×5 interferometer that postselects the GHZ⁺ state.
