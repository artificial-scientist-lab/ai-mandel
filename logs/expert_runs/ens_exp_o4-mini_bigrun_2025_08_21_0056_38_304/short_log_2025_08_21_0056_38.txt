SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed skeleton needed adjustments for Pytheus’s abstract mode indexing: the central measurement takes the four C‐modes as input (in_nodes=[0,1,2,3]), no ancillas (num_anc=0), post‐selected destructive detectors (heralding_out=null), and we optimize for coincidence count–rate (‘cr’) of the two four-click patterns “1100” and “0011”. Removed_connections aren’t relevant here (no SPDC ancillas in the measurement network), so we leave it empty.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need four detectors for the four C-modes, so num_anc must be 4 (not 0), and out_nodes remains empty for a fully destructive measurement. Let's retry with num_anc=4.
