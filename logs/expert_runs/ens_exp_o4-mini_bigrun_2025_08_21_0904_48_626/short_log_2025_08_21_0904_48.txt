Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration encodes two SPDC Bell-pair inputs (modes 0–2 and 1–3), four single‐photon ancillas for amplitude/phase damping (modes 4–7), a post‐selected Φ⁺ Bell measurement on modes 2 and 1 swapped into the ancillas, and the target two-mode Bell state on output modes 0 and 3. Ancilla detectors are all clicks, and we maximize count‐rate overlap with |Φ⁺〉.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I mistakenly marked modes 0 and 3 as both inputs and outputs. Following the entanglement‐swapping example (ES_246), we leave in_nodes and out_nodes empty and only forbid a common source between modes 0 and 3. This minimal configuration lets Pytheus optimize a Bell‐state swap network with four ancilla detectors.
