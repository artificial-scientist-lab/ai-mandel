Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network is abstracted as a heralded Bell‐state generation on modes 0 and 4, with ancilla single‐photon emitters at 5 and 6. We forbid any direct photon‐pair source linking the two ends via removed_connections. We target the Fock‐basis superposition |00>+|11> on modes 0 and 4, using two ancilla photons for heralding (heralding_out=true). All seven single emitters (modes 0–6) supply the photons.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0))]. There are 1 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [((2, 0), (3, 0))] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because I used the Fock‐basis loss and mis‐specified the target kets. Instead, I’ll revert to discrete‐variable fidelity ('fid') with qubit strings ["00","11"], specify the ancilla detectors for heralding, and ensure the config matches Pytheus’s schema.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to supply initial main‐chain photons as inputs (in_nodes) and only declare the ancilla single‐photon sources. I set in_nodes=[0–4], single_emitters=[5,6], anc_detectors=[5,6], out_nodes=[0,4], num_anc=2, heralding only ancillas, target ["00","11"] with discrete fidelity.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to remove conflicts by using only ancilla single‐photon emitters at modes 5 and 6, leave main chain photons to be created by SPDC, specify out_nodes=[0,4], anc_detectors=[5,6], num_anc=2, heralding_out=true, and use discrete fidelity on ["00","11"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s indexing rules, treat the two ancilla pairs as SPDC ancillas providing modes 0–3 (in_nodes), then the two end‐modes 4 and 5 as the Bell outputs (out_nodes). We forbid any SPDC source from feeding both ends (removed_connections [[4,5]]), use 2 ancilla pairs (num_anc=2), herald only ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true), and optimize discrete count rate (‘cr’) for the target |00⟩+|11⟩ on modes 4 and 5.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify to a heralded Bell‐state generator across two end modes using SPDC ancilla sources. Use num_anc=2 ancilla photons (one SPDC pair), heralding_out=true to detect only ancillas, and target_quantum=["00","11"] in discrete variable basis with loss_func="cr". For nonlocality, forbid any SPDC source linking both output modes via removed_connections [[0,1]].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus requires all photons to be generated internally via SPDC for heralded Bell‐state generation. I’ll use num_anc=2 SPDC‐ancilla photons, no single_emitters, empty in_nodes, out_nodes=[0,1] for the two end modes, forbid any common source via removed_connections=[[0,1]], target_quantum=["00","11"], use heralding_out=true to detect only ancillas, and optimize count‐rate fidelity (`loss_func="cr"`).
