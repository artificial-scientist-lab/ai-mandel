Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To resolve the odd‐photon error, I’ll generate three ancilla photons via single emitters at nodes [3,4,5], set heralding_out=true so only those ancilla detectors click, and define target patterns ["100","010","001"] on those three detectors. This yields an even total (6 photons) and matches Pytheus’s measurement‐analyzer format.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The prescribed one‐shot Schur analyzer map onto a Pytheus measurement setup for three input photons (three copies of subsystem A) and three detectors registering the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric clicks.  In analogy to the “W_measurement” example we require 3 ancillary detectors (num_anc = 3), three inputs (in_nodes = [0,1,2]), no out_nodes, and the three single‐click patterns as target kets.  We package this as a valid config for Pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The fault was defining impossible one‐photon kets.  We need to target all three‐photon patterns that identify the S₃ irreps: total bunching (“300”,”030”,”003”) for the symmetric sector, two-plus-one splits (“210”,”201”,”120”,”102”,”021”,”012”) for the mixed sector, and full coincidence (“111”) for the antisymmetric sector.  We feed in three unknown photons in modes [0,1,2], use three detectors (num_anc=3), no additional emitters, and optimize beam splitters/phase shifters to maximize the count‐rate on these ten patterns.  This single network implements the one‐shot three-copy Schur analyzer.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The Schur‐analyzer is most naturally cast as a three‐input, three‐ancilla measurement: three unknown photons in modes 0–2 are mixed via a passive network, and three detectors post‐select on one of ten click‐patterns that correspond to the S₃ irreps.  Following the W_measurement template, we set num_anc=3 detectors, in_nodes=[0,1,2], target_quantum to the ten three-photon Fock patterns (“300”/“030”/“003” for the fully symmetric sector, the six two-plus-one patterns for the mixed sector, and “111” for the fully antisymmetric sector), and use a count-rate loss.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: For a one-shot Schur analyzer we need a fock‐basis measurement of three input photons across three detectors. We target all 10 three-fold Fock patterns corresponding to S₃ irreps: full bunching (“300”,“030”,“003”), two-plus-one patterns (“210”,…,“012”), and full coincidence (“111”). Using loss_func “fockcr” and num_anc=3 detectors, with in_nodes=[0,1,2] and no out_nodes, matches the GHZ‐analyzer examples.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: The number of amplitudes and kets should be the same
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates I must specify amplitudes matching the three target kets. I’ll add amplitudes [1.0,1.0,1.0] to the symmetric‐sector projector config and call pytheus one final time.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: After iterating through measurement‐analyzer templates and Fock vs. discrete encodings, the most direct Pytheus configuration is a fock‐basis count‐rate (“fockcr”) measurement on three input photons (modes 0–2) with three detectors postselecting on the ten three‐photon Fock patterns corresponding to the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S₃ irreps. This one‐shot Schur analyzer yields click probabilities that encode Tr[ρ²] and Tr[ρ³].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Using the exact W_measurement template—three inputs, three detectors, count‐rate loss—to project onto the single‐click patterns ["100","010","001"], our minimal config should now succeed.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.
