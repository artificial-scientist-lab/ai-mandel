Title: One-Shot Linear-Optical S₃ Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem

Abstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S₃ irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third Rényi moments, Tr[ρ_A²] and Tr[ρ_A³], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.
