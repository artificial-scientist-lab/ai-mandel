Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to translate the time-multiplexed swapping station into an 8-mode measurement configuration, encoding two time bins as a single 8-mode Fock measurement. Each two-click pattern in t₁ and t₂ becomes an 8-bit target pattern. I'll set num_anc=2 for the one Bell pair, dimensions=[2] for time bins, and list the eight two-click patterns.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 6 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to ensure the number of input nodes (unexpanded modes) matches the length of each target string once expanded by the time-bin dimension. Using dimensions=[2] with in_nodes=[0,1,2,3] creates 8 total modes, matching the 8-bit target patterns. I'll update in_nodes and dimensions accordingly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue stemmed from mismatched node counts when combining temporal dimensions. To satisfy Pytheus, I'll treat the repeated detections across two time bins as eight distinct spatial modes, omit the ‘dimensions’ keyword, and list the eight two‐click detection patterns as eight-length Fock strings. I’ll leave in_nodes and out_nodes empty so all eight modes are considered outputs in this measurement scheme.
