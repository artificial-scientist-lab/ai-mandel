Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The telecloning transformation is fully specified; I’ll assemble a Pytheus JSON config matching the researcher’s description, including all qutrit rails, ancilla photons, heralding detectors, removed_connections, and a placeholder for the three basis‐state mappings in target_quantum. Then I’ll invoke pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (20) does not match number of in/out nodes (6 in + 9 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target_quantum kets had the wrong length; I reconstructed the correct 15-mode Fock strings for the 1→2 qutrit telecloning mapping (9 in-modes + 6 out-modes = 15), included the appropriate amplitudes, and fixed the removed_connections. Now calling pytheus with the corrected config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters. The unknown‐qutrit rails are true inputs (in_nodes), while the ancillas are from pair sources (not single emitters). I remove single_emitters and switch to a Fock‐basis fidelity loss.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous errors were due to mismatched amplitudes and target dimensions. I've now defined 15‐mode Fock patterns (9 heralded modes + 6 outputs), set num_anc=9 for the nine heralding detectors, corrected amplitudes to match the three target states, and included the removed_connections to enforce disjoint tritter inputs.
