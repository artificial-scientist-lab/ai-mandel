Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement network should detect only the ancilla photons (heralding on the two click patterns corresponding to even vs odd clicks) and leave the data photons unmeasured. We set in_nodes to the four data modes, out_nodes empty, anc_detectors for the four ancilla modes, and target_quantum to the two click patterns '1010' and '0101'. Heralding_out=true ensures only ancilla detectors are used.
