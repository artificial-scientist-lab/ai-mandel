}###Title: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping

Abstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon‐pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude‐damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell‐type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) “unlocks” a Bell component (|00⟩+|11⟩)/√2 on the target modes 0 and 3—even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement—thereby directly probing resource‐theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear‐optics network.
