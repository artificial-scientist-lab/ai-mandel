SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration aligns with the researcher’s suggestion: two SPDC sources feed modes A–B and C–D, modes B and C enter a C₃-symmetric tritter whose three output ports are number-resolving detectors (ancilla), heralding on all three clicks, leaving modes A and D undetected and projected into the Bell state |00>+|11>. We specify out_nodes=[0,1] for A,D, anc_detectors=[2,3,4], num_anc=3, heralding_out=true, and keep removed_connections empty.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the total photon number (2 main + 3 ancilla) was odd, preventing perfect matchings. To fix this without altering the target, reduce num_anc to 2 and ancilla detector ports to two, restoring an even total photon number.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous attempt failed due to odd total photon number making perfect matchings impossible. Increasing ancillas to four yields an even total for perfect matchings (2 main + 4 ancilla = 6). We keep the target unchanged.
