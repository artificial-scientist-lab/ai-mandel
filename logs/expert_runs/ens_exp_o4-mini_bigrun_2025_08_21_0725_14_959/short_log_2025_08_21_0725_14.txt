Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s suggestion is to design a linear‐optic interferometer that performs two cross‐Bell measurements at once (a “quantum butterfly” joint measurement on 4 photons), heralding the simultaneous teleportation of two spin qubits.  In Pytheus we treat this as a measurement scheme: four incoming photonic modes (two from SiV_A and SiV_C and two ancilla photons), measure them all (no surviving outputs), and postselect on the joint Bell‐Bell superposition |Φ+>_03⊗|Φ+>_12 which in the Fock basis corresponds to the four terms “0000”, “0110”, “1001”, “1111”.  We need six detectors (4 inputs + 2 ancilla), number_resolving, post‐select on these four patterns.  Here is the configuration.
