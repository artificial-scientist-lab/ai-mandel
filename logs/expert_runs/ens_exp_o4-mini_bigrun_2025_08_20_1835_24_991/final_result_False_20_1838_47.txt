Abstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00⟩, |11⟩}.
