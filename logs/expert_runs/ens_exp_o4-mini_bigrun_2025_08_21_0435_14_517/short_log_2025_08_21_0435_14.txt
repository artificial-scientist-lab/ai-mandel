Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects the single-shot GHZ4-measurement percolation primitive: three SPDC pairs, a 4-mode GHZ measurement heralded by four detectors, and end-nodes A,D as output heralding a Bell pair. Removed connections enforce separate sources.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (6) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 0 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the number of input/output nodes didn’t match the string length. We need a gate‐style specification: 6‐bit strings mapping 4 measured modes to 2 output modes. So we partition the 6 modes: in_nodes = [1,2,3,4] (B1,B2,C1,C2), out_nodes = [0,5] (A,D), strings “000000” and “111111”, and enforce SPDC sources with removed_connections. No extra ancilla photons.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates we need at least num_anc ≥ len(in_nodes) – len(out_nodes) = 4–2 = 2. We intended four ancilla detectors for the GHZ multiport, so set num_anc = 4.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Simplify to the ES246-style configuration: request a Bell state on the two end nodes (A,D) with 4 ancilla detectors, forbidding any single SPDC to connect them directly, so that the optimizer must implement the GHZ‐measurement percolation primitive.
