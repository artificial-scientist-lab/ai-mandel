Title: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)

Abstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation—teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure—by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.
