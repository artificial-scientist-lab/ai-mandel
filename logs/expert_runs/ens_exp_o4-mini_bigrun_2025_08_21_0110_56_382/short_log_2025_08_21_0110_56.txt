SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion outlines a static linear-optical network that teleports a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting single-photon erasures using a (3,1) EAQECC.  I need to express this as a Pytheus channel transformation: mapping |0>→|0> and |1>→|1> from input node 0 at A to output node 9 at D, consuming eight ancilla photons (four Bell-pair sources) and post-selecting on eight ancilla detectors.  I’ll set num_anc=8, in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[9], target_quantum=["00","11"], remove any direct source A–D via removed_connections, use 'fid' loss, L-BFGS-B optimizer, and reasonable optimization parameters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to mismatched node labeling: target_quantum strings only cover in_nodes and out_nodes, but ancilla nodes must be labeled separately. I’ll set in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1], ancilla photons implied by num_anc=8 as nodes 2–9, and adjust removed_connections to forbid direct A–D. The target strings remain ["00","11"].
