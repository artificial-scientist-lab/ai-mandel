Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now reflects the requested teleportation-based remote CNOT with PT-enhanced Bell measurement using four SPDC ancillas, forbidden cross-connections, and heralded number-resolving clicks. I'll run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration was missing the required 'tries_per_edge' parameter. I'll add "tries_per_edge": 5 and resubmit.
