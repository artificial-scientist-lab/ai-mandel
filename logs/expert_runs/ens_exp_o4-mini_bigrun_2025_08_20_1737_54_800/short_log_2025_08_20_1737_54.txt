Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The only inconsistency in the researcher’s JSON was that the four “atom” qubits prepared in |+⟩ via single-emitter sources were never listed under “single_emitters.” I will add single_emitters=[0,1,2,3] so that Pytheus knows to inject four dual-rail photons at those positions. All other fields remain exactly as suggested.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (0 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that our 8-mode target requires 8 input nodes. For measurement-style configs, in_nodes must list all modes of the target quantum strings. I’ll set in_nodes to [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7] so that the eight-mode patterns match.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes must cover all 8 modes of the 8-bit target strings, and single_emitters must be disjoint. I’ll list all 8 modes as in_nodes and clear single_emitters so the sets no longer overlap.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement-style setup requires num_anc equal to total detectors = number of input modes (4 atom + 4 ancilla) = 8. I update num_anc accordingly and list all 8 modes as in_nodes, keep single_emitters disjoint.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Measurement-style setups require num_anc equal to total detectors (input + ancilla) and in_nodes listing all modes of the target strings; single_emitters must be empty since ancillas come from SPDC.
