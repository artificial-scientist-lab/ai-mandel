Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The researcher’s chiral-edge, multi-hop entanglement swap can be mapped to a Bell‐state generation task on two “edge” modes (A and C), using two SPDC ancilla sources at the intermediate nodes (B and D), with forbidden cross‐edge and backward bonds enforced by removed_connections. I’ll keep the target as a Bell pair ["00","11"] and maximize fidelity with a static linear‐optical network, fixing the earlier invalid keys and aligning with Pytheus’s state‐generation examples.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The original constraints forbid needed SPDC bonds and had too few ancillas. I’ll simplify to a heralded Bell-pair source on the allowed edge (modes 0–1), block all non-edge bonds, use one SPDC pair (2 ancilla photons), and herald on those ancilla detectors to deliver a high-fidelity Bell state on out_nodes [0,1].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous failures indicate that the network is overconstrained. To preserve the chiral‐edge restriction while giving Pytheus enough freedom, I’ll increase the number of ancillary photons and switch to a fidelity loss function. This keeps the forbidden “bulk” bonds intact but supplies extra ancillas so a valid heralded Bell pair on modes [0,2] can be found along the allowed edge.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need a heralded Bell‐state generator on the two chiral‐edge qubit modes (A→modes 0–1 and C→modes 2–3) using two SPDC sources at the allowed bonds only. I enforce the Chern‐edge restriction by forbidding any SPDC to link modes 0 and 2, supply four ancilla photons (two SPDC pairs), herald only the ancilla detectors, and optimize fidelity of the dual‐rail Bell state |00>+|11>.
