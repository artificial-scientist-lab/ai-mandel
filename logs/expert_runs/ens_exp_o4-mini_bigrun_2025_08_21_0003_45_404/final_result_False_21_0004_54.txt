}###Title: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate

Mini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear “quantum perceptron” gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1⟩ realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w₁·x₁ + w₂·x₂), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.
