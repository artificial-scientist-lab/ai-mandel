    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).

In other words, Pytheus cannot map a 5\u21922 heralded transformation with this minimal target. Implementing amplitude damping and a coherence superposition is beyond the current Pytheus API, which only handles pure Fock\u2010basis mappings. We must therefore abandon trying to fold the damping channels and the extra coherence qubit into a single post-selected transformation. Instead, one can either (a) design a pure 2-link swap measurement (no coherence qubit/damping), or (b) build a stand-alone measurement module for the three-mode joint detection. The full coherence-assisted swap under loss cannot be expressed in a single Pytheus config."

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n.\n\n\nHere is a short abstract of the idea you should implement:\nSTART ABSTRACT\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).  The transmitted modes B\u2082, C\u2082, E\u2082 arrive at the central node.  There we implement a three-mode linear-optics network + three photon-number\u2013resolving detectors whose certain click pattern heralds a successful \u201c3-qubit swap.\u201d  Conditioned on that pattern, the remaining photons A\u2081 and D\u2081 collapse onto an entangled pure state whose resource (e.g. concurrence or relative-entropy of entanglement) exceeds what you\u2019d get by swapping only B\u2081 and C\u2081 (i.e. a two-link swap) when p\u2081,p\u2082 > 0.  \n\nNetwork visualization (photons flow top\u2192bottom):\n\n  PS\u2081 \u2192 (A\u2081)          PS\u2082 \u2192 (D\u2081)  \n          \u2198             \u2199  \n      [Damping p\u2081]  [Damping p\u2082]  \n            B\u2082             C\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n  S  \u2192 [Coherence |0>+|1>]  \n          \u2198   \n      [Damping p\u2083]  \n            E\u2082  \n                     \u2193  \n             3-mode interferometer  \n                     \u2193  \n               3 heralding detectors  \n                     \u2193  \n               swap success  \n                     \u2193  \n             output modes: A\u2081 & D\u2081  \n\nKey Pytheus settings  \n{\n  description: \"Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping under amplitude damping\",\n  num_anc: 3,                # one ancilla per damping channel\n  single_emitters: [2],      # index 2 is S\n  removed_connections: [     # forbid PS\u2081\u2192D\u2081, PS\u2081\u2192others, PS\u2082\u2192A\u2081, PS\u2082\u2192others\n    [0,3],[0,4],[1,2],[1,4]\n  ],\n  # targets are the click patterns that herald a successful 3-qubit swap\n  target_quantum: [\"01\", \"10\"],  # abstract labels; actual pattern chosen by the automaton\n  # plus standard settings: probabilistic pair sources at nodes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133; beam splitters for damping\n}\n\nGeneralizations  \n  \u2013 Sweep (p\u2081,p\u2082,p\u2083) to map out the trade-off surface between damping strengths and final entanglement.  \n  \u2013 Extend from qubits to qudits (higher\u2010dimensional coherence and entangled links).  \n  \u2013 Cascade multiple coherence-assisted swaps to study resource concentration and conversion in larger networks.\n\nThis network both (a) realizes a new quantum-optics transformation\u2014generalized swap with an extra coherence input\u2014and (b) directly tests a central quantum resource-theory question: how coherence can be converted to entanglement under realistic noise.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert: Thought: Constructing the pytheus configuration to implement the three\u2010link, coherence\u2010assisted entanglement swap under amplitude damping.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nfredkin_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected Fredkin gate, which means that we have one control qubits acting on two target qubits.\\n\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 0, nothing is changed in the target qubits.\\nIf the control qubit is in mode 1, the target qubits are swapped.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101110\" means |101> -> |110>\\n    \"110101\" means |110> -> |101>\\n    \"111111\" means |111> -> |111>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to false so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge quantum resource theory and amplitude damping in a purely Pytheus-compatible network:\n  A) Standard entanglement swapping with one leg amplitude-damped (too trivial).\n  B) Cascaded damped teleportation links to test additivity of resource loss (still variant of A).\n  C) Coherence-assisted entanglement swapping across two amplitude-damped Bell links (novel network effect).\n\nStep 2:  \n  A) Already effectively covered by \u201centanglement swapping with loss/noise\u201d literature; lacks any new resource-theoretic twist.  \n  B) Conceptually just two A), no qualitatively new effect.  \n  C) Introduces a third \u201ccoherence\u201d resource qubit that is mixed in at the swapping node to boost the final entanglement\u2014this operationally demonstrates \u201ccoherence \u2192 entanglement\u201d conversion in a network under noise. It goes beyond any of the existing Pytheus examples (which only do pure swapping) and directly tests a central quantum-resource-theory statement.\n\nStep 3: Pick C) as the most promising: it is genuinely new, purely optical, uses only single-photon emitters, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward. It is formulated as a network task (a generalized entanglement-swap) rather than state generation.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it operationalizes a quantum-resource-conversion statement\u2014\u201chow much local coherence can be converted, in the presence of amplitude damping, into nonlocal entanglement via a single joint measurement?\u201d\u2014and demonstrates that feeding an independent coherence qubit into the swap node can recover entanglement that would otherwise be lost to damping. No prior optical\u2010swap experiment has combined a third coherence resource in this way.\n\nStep 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because  \n  \u2022 We use two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (Bell pairs) plus one single\u2010photon emitter (the coherence qubit).  \n  \u2022 Each of the three \u201clinks\u201d (two swap legs + the coherence link) is preceded by a beam-splitter + vacuum ancilla \u2192 a click/no-click heralding detector, realising amplitude-damping Kraus operators.  \n  \u2022 At the central node we implement a single linear-optics network (3 input modes \u2192 interferometer \u2192 3 photon-number resolving detectors) whose click pattern heralds a successful generalized swap.  \n  \u2022 The distant photons (Alice and Bob\u2019s output modes) are then routed to two detectors (for state tomography).  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or cavities; only linear optics, ancillas, and post-selection.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target\u2014\u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d:\n\nExplanation  \nWe want to entangle two distant photons (A & D) by a generalized swap that draws on three \u201clinks\u201d:  \n  (i) Bell-pair 1: PS\u2081 emits to A\u2081 & B\u2081.  \n  (ii) Bell-pair 2: PS\u2082 emits to C\u2081 & D\u2081.  \n  (iii) Coherence qubit: single-photon emitter S emits to E\u2081 in the superposition |0\u27e9+|1\u27e9.  \n\nLinks B\u2081, C\u2081, and E\u2081 each pass through an independent amplitude-damping module (beam splitter with transmissivity \u221a1\u2013p\u1d62 plus a heralding ancilla detector).
