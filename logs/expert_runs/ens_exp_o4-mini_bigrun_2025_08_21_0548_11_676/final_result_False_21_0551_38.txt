}###Title: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring

Abstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target—a closed “teleporter loop” around a four-site square—by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.
