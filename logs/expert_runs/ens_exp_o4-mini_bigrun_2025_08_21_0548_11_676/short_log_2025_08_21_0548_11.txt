Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for the clockwise teleporter loop implementing a Pauli X holonomy is complete—let’s submit it to Pytheus for optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that in_nodes and out_nodes were not contiguous starting from 0 and matching the length of the discrete-variable kets. We fix this by using dual-rail encoding: in_nodes [0,1], out_nodes [2,3], target_quantum strings of length 4, and keep the 8 ancillas separate. This satisfies Pytheus’s contiguity requirement without altering the Pauli-X mapping.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (2 in + 2 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target_quantum strings must span all in+out nodes, so use 4-digit dual-rail mappings: "0110" for |0>→X|0> and "1001" for |1>→X|1>. Retry with those.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The removed_connections must reference detector (ancilla) nodes only, not in/out nodes. I’ll renumber the 12 total nodes: nodes 0–1 are dual-rail input, 2–3 dual-rail output, 4–5 B‐Bell, 6–7 C‐Bell, 8–9 D‐Bell, 10–11 A‐Bell detectors. I’ll specify anc_detectors as [4–11], leave in_nodes [0,1], out_nodes [2,3], and removed_connections only between those detector nodes to forbid each SPDC source from connecting to nonadjacent Bell analyzers. Then submit to Pytheus.
