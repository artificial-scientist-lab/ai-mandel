}###Title: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation

Abstract: In the PythyUS target “Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,” a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber–coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct‐fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell‐teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the “send-it” and “teleport-it” arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.
