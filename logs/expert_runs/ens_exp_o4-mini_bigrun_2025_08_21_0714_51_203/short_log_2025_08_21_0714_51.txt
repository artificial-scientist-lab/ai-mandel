Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration is now a valid Pytheus measurement setup: data modes [0–3] pass through unmeasured (out_nodes), ancilla modes [4–7] are heralded detectors, and the only accepted two-photon click patterns (“1010” and “0101”) implement a passive one-shot Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ stabilizer measurement without feed-forward.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (4) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 4 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the config to treat this as a four‐mode Fock‐basis post‐selected interferometer: input photons at modes 0–3, no extra ancillas, and optimize for only the two even–odd click patterns [1,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,1]. Use loss_func "fockcr" and remove out_nodes so that in_nodes alone defines the measurement detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: The number of amplitudes and kets should be the same
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because we omitted amplitudes for the two target Fock patterns. Adding amplitudes [1,1] to match the two kets resolves this. We'll treat the four ancilla photons as incoming Fock-mode inputs, no outputs (out_nodes empty), and target two-photon click patterns [1,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,1] with loss_func 'fockcr'.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Configure this as a four‐mode Fock‐basis measurement: exclusively ancilla inputs on modes 0–3, no outputs, targeting exactly the two two-photon click patterns [1,0,1,0] and [0,1,0,1] with equal amplitudes. Use loss_func “fockcr”, num_anc=0, num_pre=1, and all other required defaults.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We recast this as a pure measurement network: four incoming ancilla photons (modes 0–3), no “output” data modes in the Pytheus sense, four detectors (num_anc=4), and we ask Pytheus to enforce that only the two 4-click patterns “1010” and “0101” occur. This matches the measurement examples (W, GHZ) using target_quantum, in_nodes, out_nodes=[], and num_anc=detectors.
