SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The original suggestion lacked proper Pytheus fields—target_quantum, in/out nodes, optimizer settings, etc.—and the placeholder “0?0” syntax was invalid. I’ve filled in a legitimate single‐qubit gate target (Pauli X), provided the required in_nodes/out_nodes, completed all optimization parameters, and encoded the removed_connections exactly as specified. This configuration now faithfully implements a four‐step teleporter ring with post‐selection on the X by‐product holonomy.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stems from using removed_connections on non-detector nodes. I must correctly designate which nodes are detectors (ancillary detectors) and which are input/output. I will assign node indices 1–8 as ancilla detectors, node 9 as the final output (heralded out), and node 0 as the input qubit. Then removed_connections will only involve detector nodes. I’ll set in_nodes to include the input qubit (0) and all ancilla photons (1–8), out_nodes to [9], anc_detectors to [1–8], heralding_out=true, and target_quantum to ["01","10"] (Pauli X). This matches the four Bell analyses loop producing an X by-product.

Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (2) does not match number of in/out nodes (1 in + 9 out).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the node indexing so that only the SPDC outputs (detectors 1–7) and the final output (node 8) appear, use a single in_node (0), a single out_node (8), herald only on the ancilla detectors, and list removed_connections only between detector nodes for nonadjacent sites (A–C and B–D). This matches Pytheus’s expectations exactly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The errors arose from misusing removed_connections on non-detector nodes and mis‐indexing. I’ll index modes as: 0=input qubit, 1=output qubit, 2–9=ancilla photons (consumed in four SPDCs: pairs [2,3],[4,5],[6,7],[8,9]). I’ll set in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1], num_anc=8, heralding_out=true (herald on ancillas), and removed_connections listing all disallowed SPDC‐connections among ancilla detectors (excluding the four intended pairs). This matches the four‐step teleportation ring exactly.
