Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to translate the hybrid DV–CV entanglement swapping protocol into a Pytheus config for a post-selected generation of the |00⟩+|11⟩ state on output modes A and C, with two heralding detections. I'll use probabilistic pair sources, two ancilla detectors, and enforce no common source for the outputs via removed_connections.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to using the wrong loss function and missing explicit Fock‐basis syntax for a two‐mode |00>+|11> target. I will switch to ‘fockfid’, specify the target as Fock lists, mark the first two modes as outputs, keep two ancilla detectors, and enforce no common source between modes 0 and 1. Then rerun.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to providing an empty amplitudes list. I will supply matching amplitudes [1.0, 1.0] for the two Fock kets and retry the heralded |00>+|11> configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((2, 0), (3, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0))]. There are 1 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [((2, 0), (3, 0))] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous failures arose from mismatched Fock‐fid requirements and overly strict mode restrictions. I'll switch back to a count‐rate loss on string kets, mirror the ES_246 pattern, use two ancilla photons heralded to detectors, and ban any common source between modes 0 and 1 via removed_connections. This should allow Pytheus to find a heralded |00>+|11> scheme.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Increase sampling and topological search parameters to give Pytheus more opportunity, while keeping two heralding ancillas and the no-common-source restriction.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: After multiple attempts, it becomes clear that Pytheus cannot realize the hybrid DV–CV entanglement swapping target |0⟩|0⟩+|1⟩|1⟩ because it requires superposing different total photon numbers (vacuum versus two photons) and modeling a continuous‐variable two‐mode squeezer. These capabilities lie beyond Pytheus’s discrete, fixed‐photon‐number framework. I conclude that this suggestion cannot be implemented with Pytheus as specified.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The hybrid swap reduces to heralded post‐selection of the two‐mode Fock Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ on modes A and C. I’ll mimic the probabilistic‐pair‐source ES example with two ancilla detectors for the B‐node Bell measurement, enforce no common SPDC source for A and C, and use count‐rate loss with heralding.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Increasing the number of ancillas should give Pytheus more flexibility. I'll boost num_anc to four (similar to the 4d entanglement‐swapping example), keep the no–common‐source restriction, herald only the ancilla clicks, and search for the post‐selected |00>+|11> mapping on output modes.
