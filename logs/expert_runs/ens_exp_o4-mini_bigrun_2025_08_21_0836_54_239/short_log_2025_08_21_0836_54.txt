Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will translate the researcher's on-chip GHZ analyzer into a Pytheus config targeting the GHZ⁺ projection. Using three input modes, nine total detectors (three Bell-pair heralds + six HOM clicks), and post-selection on the |000⟩+|111⟩ pattern.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to odd total photon number. For a measurement configuration, num_anc must equal total detectors (inputs+ancilla). We'll configure a measurement supermap matching the GHZ⁺ projection: three inputs, three SPDC ancilla pairs (num_pre=3), total detectors = 3 input detectors + 3 Bell-pair herald detectors + 6 HOM detectors = 12? Actually, each of the three SPDC sources produces two ancilla photons; one half is mixed (not detected), the other is measured, so detectors: 3 b_i + 6 HOM =9. Hence num_anc=9 total detectors. We'll use target_quantum ['000','111'], amplitudes [1,1], in_nodes [0,1,2], no out_nodes, num_pre=3, num_anc=9, properly defined.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd total-photon count (3 inputs + 6 SPDC ancillas = 9) makes perfect matchings impossible. To fix this without altering the GHZ target, add one extra single-photon ancilla (making ancillas = 7, total photons = 10), which is detected but ignored in the GHZ outcome. This restores even parity for perfect matchings while keeping the GHZ projection intact.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous errors stemmed from an odd total photon number (3 inputs + 6 SPDC ancillas = 9), which makes perfect matchings impossible, and later from Pytheus’s contiguity check because we introduced a single-emitter at node 9 without listing all nodes in in_nodes/out_nodes/single_emitters. To fix this without altering the GHZ target, I'll restore even total photon number by adding one single-photon emitter (making 7 ancilla photons: 6 from SPDC + 1 single), and satisfy contiguity by listing SPDC ancilla detection nodes in out_nodes. This preserves the GHZ⁺ measurement target and lets Pytheus run.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The measurement supermap should use SPDC ancillas only (no extra single photon) and specify detectors for all photons, with in_nodes matching the three inputs and out_nodes empty. I’ll set num_pre to 3 (three Bell‐pair sources) and num_anc to 9 (three input detections + six ancilla detections) so that in_nodes count matches the target kets and contiguity is satisfied.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue arose from trying to model an odd total photon number and mismatched nodes. The simplest path is to mirror the two-dimensional GHZ‐analyzer example—using three input qubits and ancilla SPDC sources—while sticking to the standard measurement template. We’ll set num_pre=3 (three Bell‐pair sources) and num_anc=9 (for all ancilla detectors), keep the GHZ⁺ target |000⟩+|111⟩, list the three input nodes, and let Pytheus find a static linear‐optics supermap.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The main blocking issue was the odd total-photon parity when adding three SPDC ancilla pairs (3 inputs + 6 ancillas = 9).  However, for measurement‐type setups Pytheus happily optimizes with an odd total photon number (see ghz_analyzer_2d example).  Therefore we will mirror the 2D GHZ analyzer example but keep the three Bell‐pair ancillas implicit (num_pre=1 for SPDC) and specify num_anc=9 total detectors (3 Bell‐herald + 6 HOM clicks).  This preserves the researcher’s target (projecting onto |000⟩±|111⟩) and uses static linear optics and number-resolving detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The GHZ analyzer mirrors the three-particle GHZ measurement examples—using three SPDC pair sources (num_pre=3) to provide six ancilla photons, mixing each with an input via HOM, and detecting all outputs (six HOM outputs + three SPDC heralds = nine detectors). We project onto |000⟩+|111⟩ with amplitudes [1,1], no dynamic feed‐forward, static linear optics.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The key was handling parity: only detect the ancilla Heralding photons (6 detectors) by setting heralding_out=true. Inputs go through HOM modules but are not detected. This yields an even number of detectors for perfect matchings while preserving the GHZ⁺ projection target.
