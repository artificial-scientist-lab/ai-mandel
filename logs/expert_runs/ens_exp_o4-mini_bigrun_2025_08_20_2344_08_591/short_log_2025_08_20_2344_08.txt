Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The goal is to build a purely passive, post‐selected 4D‐Bell measurement network. I’ll model it as a measurement task: two ququart inputs at in_nodes [0,1], two ancilla photons from single‐photon emitters at [2,3], and ten number‐resolving detectors (num_anc=10) that herald four orthogonal 4D Bell states (target_quantum=["00","11","22","33"]). I’ll forbid any common source between the two ququart inputs via removed_connections=[[0,1]] and use L-BFGS-B with a ‘cr’ loss.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration will set up a passive, post‐selected measurement network that discriminates the 4-dimensional Bell state |Φ₀〉=∑ₖ|k,k〉 via heralded ancilla clicks. We encode two ququarts on modes 0–3 and 4–7, add two ancilla photons at modes 8–9, use ten number-resolving detectors (num_anc=10), and define the four frequency-mode kets of |Φ₀〉 in target_quantum with equal amplitudes. We'll leave out removed_connections for now.
