Entanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D→E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts φ₂ and φ₃ controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A–C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network—implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.
