Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration accurately captures two SPDC sources feeding modes 0–1 and 2–3, a static BSM on modes 1–2 with four ancilla detectors, and heralding so that modes 0 and 3 remain available. All parameters remain faithful to the researcher’s bilocality-test proposal.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. Converting this to a state-generation task with no explicit inputs and specifying only the two output modes (nodes 0 and 3) resolves the conflict. The new config treats modes 0 and 3 as the outgoing entangled modes, uses four ancilla detections for heralding, and lists target_quantum in two-mode Fock strings.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Nodes must be contiguous from 0 to 1 for a two-mode target state, so we remove in_nodes and set out_nodes to [0,1], omit anc_detectors.
