}###Title: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band

Abstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early〉+e^{iφ}|late〉) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A–R and R–C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto Φ⁺_Z or Φ⁺_X respectively, and by scanning φ and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.
