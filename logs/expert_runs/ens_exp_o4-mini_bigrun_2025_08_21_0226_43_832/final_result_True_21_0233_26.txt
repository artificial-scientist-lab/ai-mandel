}###Title:  
Heralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)

Mini-Abstract:  
We implement the PythEUS target “4q_stabilizer_jump” by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0–3) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4–7) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map ρ→(1−p)ρ+pSρS which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation dρ/dt=γ[SρS−ρ], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.
