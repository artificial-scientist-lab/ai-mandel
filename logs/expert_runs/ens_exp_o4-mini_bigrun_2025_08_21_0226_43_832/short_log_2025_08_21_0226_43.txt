Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration for a heralded four‐qubit stabilizer jump gate S=Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z is now complete with data qubit single emitters, two pair sources for ancilla photons, removed_connections enforcing no direct ancilla–data links, heralding_out to keep data outputs, and the correct 16 input–output mappings with ±1 amplitudes by parity. I will now run Pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. Data qubit inputs at [0–3] and outputs at [4–7] must be disjoint. Remove removed_connections for now and set out_nodes to [4,5,6,7], with SPDC ancilla modes at [8,9,10,11] implicitly from num_anc=4. Submit revised config.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust in/out nodes and remove single_emitters/removed_connections so that data qubits and ancilla from SPDC align with Pytheus expectations; set in_nodes [0–3], out_nodes [4–7], num_anc=4 for two pair sources, heralding_out true, no single_emitters, default anc_detectors.
