    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ntoffoli_3d_post\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected three-dimensional Toffoli gate, which means that we have two control qubits acting on one target qutrit.\\n\\nIf the control qubits are both in mode one, we add 1 (mod 3) to the target qutrit\\nIn any other case the target qutrit stays unchanged.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"000000\" means |000> -> |000>\\n    \"001001\" means |001> -> |001>\\n    \"002002\" means |002> -> |002>\\n    \"010010\" means |010> -> |010>\\n    \"011011\" means |011> -> |011>\\n    \"012012\" means |012> -> |012>\\n    \"100100\" means |100> -> |100>\\n    \"101101\" means |101> -> |101>\\n    \"102102\" means |102> -> |102>\\n    \"110111\" means |110> -> |111>\\n    \"111112\" means |111> -> |112>\\n    \"112110\" means |112> -> |110>\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1,2] expresses that the first three numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [3,4,5] expresses that the fourth, fifth and sixth number are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nThis transformation requires two ancillary photons which are created from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 control qubit][2 target qutrit]\\nsetup: [result of optimization, including spdc sources creating ancillary particles]\\ndetectors: [3 out][4 out][5 out][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nThe keyword \"number_resolving\" is set to true which means that number resolving detectors are used.\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to null (default is false) so for the correct operation of the gate all detectors (output detectors and ancilla detectors) have to click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 different pytheus-compatible ways to entwine \u201ctopological lattice\u201d and \u201canomalous Floquet topological insulator\u201d into a quantum\u2010network target.  \n  1) A ring of N parties where two alternating entanglement-swapping steps (the \u201cFloquet steps\u201d) map initial Bell-pairs on one set of edges to Bell-pairs on the complementary set of edges, with no direct sources linking those final partners\u2014thus realizing an \u201canomalous\u201d entanglement pump on the ring.  \n  2) A 2D plaquette of four parties arranged in a square, where a four-step sequence of entanglement swapping around the boundary (horizontal then vertical then horizontal then vertical swaps) produces chiral circulation of entanglement around the edges, yet leaves the bulk unentangled\u2014simulating an anomalous Floquet edge mode.  \n  3) A tree-like network (branching 1\u21922\u21924 parties) in which sequential swapping stages route an initial Bell-pair at the root through successive levels in a Floquet-driven pattern\u2014ending up sharing entanglement only between nodes at the leaves after an odd number of drive steps, and back at the root after an even number.  \n\nStep 2: Novelty check and Pytheus obstacles.  \n  1) The 1D ring pump is not just single entanglement swapping; it requires simultaneous design of two heralded \u201cFloquet steps\u201d in one static interferometer, with two distinct heralding signatures mapping to two complementary entanglement patterns. This hasn\u2019t been done in the explored list. Pytheus can handle multiple heralding outcomes and symmetric removed_connections.  \n  2) The 2D plaquette chiral\u2010edge pump is more complex: four sequential swapping steps are tricky to encode in a static network without explicit time control. That may exceed Pytheus\u2019s static design capacity.  \n  3) The tree\u2010network pump is exotic but essentially a layered sequence of pairwise swaps\u2014it reduces to repeated 1D ideas and risks being too similar to independent entanglement\u2010swapping chains.  \n\nStep 3: Pick the ring pump as most promising.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it realizes an \u201canomalous Floquet topological insulator\u201d in a purely linear\u2010optical, heralded quantum\u2010network scenario: two complementary entanglement configurations (the two Floquet steps) coexist as two heralding outcomes of the same static setup, and the entanglement flow around the ring has nonzero winding (chiral pump) despite trivial bulk linkage.  \nStep 5: This is feasible in the pytheus framework because it only requires probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla detectors, removed_connections to forbid direct sources between non-neighboring parties, and two heralding signatures\u2014operations directly supported by Pytheus (no dynamic feedback control, no cavities, no state generation beyond multi-node entanglement swapping).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nExperiment title: \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring\u201d\n\nExplanation:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical network that, upon two different ancilla\u2010heralding outcomes, realizes two complementary entanglement\u2010swapping patterns on a ring of four parties (A, B, C, D). In one heralding signature (\u201cFloquet step 1\u201d) it produces Bell\u2010pairs on edges A\u2013B and C\u2013D. In the other heralding signature (\u201cFloquet step 2\u201d) it produces Bell\u2010pairs on edges B\u2013C and D\u2013A. No direct photon\u2010pair source ever links the final entangled partners. This is the optical analogue of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator: entanglement is \u201cpumped\u201d chirally around the ring while the bulk remains unentangled.  \n\nVisualization:  \n\u2022 Emitters / Pair\u2010sources: multiple probabilistic photon-pair sources feeding four output modes (0:A, 1:B, 2:C, 3:D) plus ancilla modes.  \n\u2022 Setup (to be optimized by Pytheus): linear interferometer interconnecting all sources before detectors.  \n\u2022 Detectors:  \n  \u2013 Mode 0 (party A)  \n  \u2013 Mode 1 (party B)  \n  \u2013 Mode 2 (party C)  \n  \u2013 Mode 3 (party D)  \n  \u2013 Ancilla detectors 4,5,\u2026 measuring heralding patterns.  \n\nConfiguration sketch:  \n  * target_quantum: ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1] AND separately ['00','11'] on detectors [2,3] for heralding outcome \u201cstep1\u201d  \n                 ['00','11'] on detectors [1,2] AND ['00','11'] on detectors [3,0] for heralding outcome \u201cstep2\u201d  \n  * num_anc: \u22654 ancilla detectors  \n  * removed_connections: forbid any source connecting 0\u21941 or 2\u21943 for step2, and forbid 1\u21942 or 3\u21940 for step1, ensuring no direct source can link the final entangled pairs.  \n  * heralding_out: define two distinct patterns of clicks on ancilla detectors corresponding to \u201cstep1\u201d and \u201cstep2.\u201d  \n  * optimizer, loss_func, samples, thresholds: as in previous entanglement-swapping examples.  \n\nGenerality:  \n\u2013 One can expand to rings of N parties (odd N for truly anomalous Floquet pumps), to 2D networks (plaquette edge\u2010mode pumps), and to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces (qutrit rings).  \n\u2013 Fundamental physics questions: topological invariants in heralded quantum networks, entanglement winding number, robustness against source loss or node removal.  \n\nThis target combines \u201ctopological lattice\u201d (the ring of parties) with \u201canomalous Floquet topological insulator\u201d (two-step chiral entanglement pumping) purely within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optical, heralded network framework.\nEND SUGGESTION\n\n\n\nYou have one possible action, 'pytheus'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on your progress and decide what to do next)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'pytheus')\nAction Input: (the input string to the action, which is a string in full JSON syntax, similar to the examples above, only config, no explanation needed, single level)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
