Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration reflects two SPDC sources each emitting a signal and a noise photon, uses a Bell projection on the signals (out_nodes=[0,1]), interferes the noise ancillas with heralding (num_anc=2, heralding_out=true), removes any common source between the signal modes, and targets the Bell state ['00','11']. All parameters are consistent with the suggested modifications.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates that two ancillas are insufficient. The original proposal requires four ancilla detectors (two noisy modes per link, heralded fourfold). I'll increase num_anc to 4 and let out_nodes default (empty) so signals pass through unmeasured, then retry.
