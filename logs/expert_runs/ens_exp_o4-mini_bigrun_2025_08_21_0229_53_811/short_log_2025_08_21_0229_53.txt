Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested modifications convert the Bell-vs-GHZ analyzer into a single static LOQC module that performs 2-qubit versus 3-qubit computational-basis measurements by toggling ancilla injections on modes 5 and 6. To faithfully implement this in Pytheus, I must correct the JSON: remove comments, add required keys (foldername, tries_per_edge, removed_connections), and ensure parameters (num_anc, in_nodes, out_nodes) reflect the design. The two ancilla photons come from single_emitters, and we have 12 detectors in total. Now I will invoke pytheus with the cleaned configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates in_nodes and single_emitters overlapped. I correct in_nodes to only signal modes [0–4] and expand target_quantum to 12-bit detector patterns matching num_anc=12. Then I’ll rerun pytheus.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous Pytheus calls failed because we mixed in_nodes with single_emitters and mis‐specified in_nodes/out_nodes for a detection protocol. To correct this, we treat all seven incoming photons (5 signal + 2 ancilla) as in_nodes, leave out_nodes empty so every photon ends in a detector, and set num_anc equal to the total number of detectors (12). We split the 19 modes into 7 inputs (nodes 0–6) and 12 detector outputs (nodes 7–18). Each target string must be a 19‐character binary string specifying one photon in each input node (the input Fock pattern) and exactly one photon in the corresponding detector node (the one-hot output). Below is the corrected configuration.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network is purely a measurement module: we inject all seven modes (five signal + two ancilla) as inputs, use num_anc=12 detectors, and let Pytheus route each of the 12 distinct Fock‐input patterns (4 two‐qubit + ancilla‐pattern “10” and 8 three‐qubit + ancilla‐pattern “01”) to a unique detector click. No single_emitters are required; ancilla photons are part of the input patterns.
