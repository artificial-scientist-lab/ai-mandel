Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now accurately reflects the researcher’s square‐loop Z₂‐flux entanglement‐swapping protocol: four SPDC sources (num_pre=1, num_anc=4), forbidden diagonal connections, Bell‐swap heralding at nodes 1 & 3 with heralding_out=true, and target Bell‐pair between 0 & 2. I’ll run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error comes from non-contiguous node numbering. To fix this without changing the target, include nodes 1 and 3 (the Bell-swap heralds) in out_nodes and encode their clicks as ‘1’s in the target strings. Now we have four nodes [0–3] contiguous, and the kets are four-digit strings where bits at 1 and 3 are always ‘1’.
