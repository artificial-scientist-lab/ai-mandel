Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now correctly encodes the four-photon GHZ‐projection teleportation of two qubits, with two ancilla photons, forbidding any direct source links, heralding via the ancilla detectors, and targeting the unnormalized GHZ Choi state |0000>+|1111>. I will run PyTheus with this configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure indicates two ancilla photons are insufficient to realize a four‐photon GHZ projection under the current constraints. I will add more ancillas (four total) to give the optimizer freedom to construct the joint GHZ measurement, and tighten optimization parameters.
