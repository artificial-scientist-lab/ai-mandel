}###Title:  
Integrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  

Mini-Abstract:  
We demonstrate the target “Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities” by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |ψ⟩ₐ → (|ψ⟩ᵦ + |ψ⟩𝒸)/√2 without feed-forward.
