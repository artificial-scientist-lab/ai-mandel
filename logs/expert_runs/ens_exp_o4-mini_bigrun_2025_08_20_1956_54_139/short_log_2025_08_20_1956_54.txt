Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Translating the 3-dimensional qudit butterfly protocol into a concrete 4-mode linear-optical transformation (two inputs → two outputs) with 7 ancillary photons (3 for the d-SUM parity check + 4 for the two Bell measurements), forbidding any source to span a sender and the wrong receiver, and post-selecting on only the ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true).

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 2), (3, 2), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The failure was due to an odd total photon count (11 modes) and no explicit ancilla‐detector list, causing Pytheus to treat all 11 modes as outputs. We need an even total photon number (2 unknown + 10 ancilla = 12) and must list the 10 ancilla detector nodes in “anc_detectors.” Then Pytheus will only enforce the identity map on the 4 main modes and detect the 10 ancillas, allowing perfect matchings. We'll set num_anc=10, anc_detectors=[4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3], heralding_out=true, and preserve the identity target Quantum kets.
