SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggestion’s config was missing required JSON formatting and several default keys; I’ll supply a valid Pytheus config object that faithfully reflects the original 4‐site OTOC interferometer target without altering the target itself.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: out_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because single_emitters overlapped with implicit out_nodes. I'll remove single_emitters and declare the four atom modes as in_nodes so that out_nodes and single_emitters are disjoint, keeping the target unchanged.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: We need to treat this as a measurement scheme with eight detectors, so set num_anc to 8 (total detectors), leave in_nodes empty, include the four photon sources as single_emitters, and keep target_quantum entries at length 8.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because single_emitters cannot overlap with the default out_nodes. Following the measurement‐scheme examples (e.g., GHZ analyzer) I’ll remove single_emitters entirely and declare the four atom photons as in_nodes; no explicit out_nodes so that Pytheus treats all photons as detected. This keeps the original target and resources unchanged.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Align the target node count with in_nodes by treating all eight photons (four atom qubits + four ancilla photons) as inputs to a measurement scheme. Using target_quantum patterns of length eight, no single_emitters, and num_anc=8 to match the total detectors.
