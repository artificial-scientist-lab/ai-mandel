SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration now correctly encodes a heralded single‐qubit Pauli‐X “teleporter loop” gate: one input at node 0, one output at node 4, eight ancilla photons from four SPDC sources, and forbidding nonadjacent SPDC bonds via removed_connections. I will submit this config to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because target_quantum kets didn’t match the total node count. We need 12 nodes (2 qubit rail + 8 ancilla + 2 output rails). I’ll update in_nodes to [0,1], out_nodes to [10,11], build kets of length 12 with ancilla bits all “1”, and clear removed_connections for now so nodes are contiguous.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error stemmed from non-contiguous node indices. I will revert to a simple gate mapping with one input node 0, one output node 1, target_quantum ["01","10"], num_anc=8 SPDC ancilla photons, no removed_connections so indices remain contiguous.
