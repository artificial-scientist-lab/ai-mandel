Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested Pytheus skeleton used inline comments and non-JSON syntax around keys and target strings. I will correct these syntax issues—adding proper quotes, removing comments—and produce a valid JSON config that exactly captures the researcher's D₃ teleportation target without altering its structure.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Target state had invalid format and could not be created.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to invalid JSON syntax in the target_quantum strings. I'll provide a correctly formatted JSON config—removing comments, fixing quotes, and ensuring no trailing commas—so it stays true to the researcher’s D₃‐teleportation target.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that Pytheus requires pure basis‐mapping strings and a separate amplitudes array, not inline ‘+’ or ‘e^{iθ}’ in the strings. I will list all eight basis mappings (two kets per D₃ outcome) in `target_quantum`, use `imaginary="polar"`, and supply polar amplitudes encoding the phases. This preserves the researcher’s non‐Abelian router structure.
