}###Title: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts

Mini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10×10 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors—realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.
