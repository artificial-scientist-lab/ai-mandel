Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration matches the nonlocal parity (XOR) gate: Alice and Bob as single-photon emitters in modes 0,1, SPDC ancilla in modes 2,3, and target_quantum mapping input bits to a single click in output modes encoding x⊕y. Let's run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that inputs and single_emitters cannot overlap. Alice and Bob’s photons should be treated as inputs (in_nodes) only, so we remove single_emitters.
