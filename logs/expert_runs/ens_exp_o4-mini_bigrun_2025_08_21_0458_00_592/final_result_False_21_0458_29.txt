}###Title: Heralded CPHASE‐Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product φ_A·φ_B Detection

Abstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts φ_A and φ_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos φ_A·cos φ_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos φ_A and cos φ_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product φ_A·φ_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.
