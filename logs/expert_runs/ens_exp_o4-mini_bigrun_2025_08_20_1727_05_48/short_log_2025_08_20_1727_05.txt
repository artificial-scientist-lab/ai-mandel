Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration encodes six incoming GHZ resource photons, four ancilla detectors for the joint GHZ measurement, and leaves the four end modes undetected (heralding_out) to project onto the GHZ₄. Removed_connections forbids any common source among output modes, ensuring genuine nonlocal fusion. I will now run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I must recast this as a static measurement network: Pytheus will design a heralded GHZ‐basis measurement on four modes that projects onto |0000>+|1111> and thus fuses two unknown GHZ₃ inputs into an output GHZ₄. For a measurement task, in_nodes and out_nodes must be empty, num_anc equals the total number of detectors, and target_quantum strings are 4‐digit patterns. I forbid any common source among the four “output” detectors to enforce nonlocality.
