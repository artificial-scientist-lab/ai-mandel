Title: Single‐Shot Fusion of Tripartite GHZ States into a Four-Party GHZ via Multiparty Entanglement Swapping

Mini-abstract: We propose and analyze a linear-optical protocol that fuses two independent GHZ₃ resources into the target four-party GHZ₄ state (|0000⟩+|1111⟩) across four distant nodes using a single four-photon joint measurement in a static network. This method implements a genuine multiparty entanglement‐swapping primitive—heralded by a specific four‐click pattern on ancilla detectors—offering a resource‐efficient and scalable approach to nonlocal quantum correlation growth in photonic networks.
