Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The target mapping strings and node indices were inconsistent; corrected the target_quantum entries and set in_nodes/out_nodes for two input qubit photons and one output ququart photon. Set heralding_out=true so only ancilla detectors click.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 2), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the target strings and node assignments were wrong—dual-rail encoding requires four input modes and four output modes, so each target string must be 8 digits long. I’ve fixed the target_quantum entries, set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], out_nodes=[4,5,6,7], num_pre=2 (two Bell sources), num_anc=4, and heralding_out=true to only detect the ancillas.
