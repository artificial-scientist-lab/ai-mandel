Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The distilled SSH‐star entanglement‐swap for two branches is now encoded as a minimal Pytheus configuration with two Bell‐pair sources, removal of cross‐talk connections, two herald detectors, and heralded output. This matches the suggested modifications.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The forbidden connections were blocking the actual Bell‐pair sources. We must allow the branch sources ([0,2] and [1,3]) and instead forbid cross‐branch links ([0,3] and [1,2]). I’ll update removed_connections accordingly and retry.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The strict removal of branch connections blocked any valid network. I’ll relax by removing all `removed_connections` and let Pytheus freely optimize the minimal heralded Bell-swap for two branches with two ancilla detectors.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The network needs more ancilla photons to realize the heralded Bell‐swap. I’ll increase num_anc from 2 to 4 (allowing two SPDC pairs) and keep no removed_connections so Pytheus can freely optimize the minimal entanglement swap.
