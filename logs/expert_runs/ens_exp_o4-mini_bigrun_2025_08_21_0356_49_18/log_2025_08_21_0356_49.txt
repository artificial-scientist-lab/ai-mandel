    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1. Objective  \n  Learn a single *tunable* linear\u2010optical circuit that, when fed one copy of an *unknown* three\u2010photon state \u03c1_ABC plus ancillas, produces detector\u2010click statistics from which a classical post\u2010processing computes an *estimate* W_est \u2248 three\u2010tangle(\u03c1_ABC).\n\n2. Resources & Topology  \n  \u2022 Inputs (modes 0,1,2): three photons in unknown \u03c1_ABC.  \n  \u2022 Ancillas: three Bell\u2010pair sources (6 photons) on modes (3\u21944), (5\u21946), (7\u21948).  \n  \u2022 Variational Interferometer U(\u03b8): beam\u2010splitter + phase\u2010shifter mesh acting on modes 0\u20138. Parameters \u03b8 {r_i, \u03c6_j} tune internal reflectivities & phases.  \n  \u2022 Detectors: number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes 0\u20138.  \n  \u2022 Outcome classification: define a set of M detector\u2010click patterns {C_k} and a linear post\u2010processing function f(C_k; \u03b1) that maps frequencies p_k to W_est = \u03a3_k \u03b1_k p_k.\n\n3. Variational Training Loop  \n  1. Pick a training set of known three\u2010photon states {\u03c1_i} spanning GHZ, W, and separable classes; compute their true three\u2010tangles \u03c4_i offline.  \n  2. For each \u03c1_i and fixed \u03b8, run many trials: collect click frequencies p^{(i)}_k. Compute W_est^{(i)}(\u03b8,\u03b1) = \u03a3_k \u03b1_k\u2009p^{(i)}_k.  \n  3. Define loss L(\u03b8,\u03b1) = \u03a3_i [W_est^{(i)}(\u03b8,\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c4_i]\u00b2.  \n  4. Use a classical optimizer (e.g. gradient\u2010free or simultaneous perturbation) to update {\u03b8,\u03b1} and *minimize* L.  \n  5. Iterate until convergence, yielding a trained circuit U(\u03b8*) and coefficients \u03b1*.\n\n4.

It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1. Objective  \n  Learn a single *tunable* linear\u2010optical circuit that, when fed one copy of an *unknown* three\u2010photon state \u03c1_ABC plus ancillas, produces detector\u2010click statistics from which a classical post\u2010processing computes an *estimate* W_est \u2248 three\u2010tangle(\u03c1_ABC).\n\n2. Resources & Topology  \n  \u2022 Inputs (modes 0,1,2): three photons in unknown \u03c1_ABC.  \n  \u2022 Ancillas: three Bell\u2010pair sources (6 photons) on modes (3\u21944), (5\u21946), (7\u21948).  \n  \u2022 Variational Interferometer U(\u03b8): beam\u2010splitter + phase\u2010shifter mesh acting on modes 0\u20138. Parameters \u03b8 {r_i, \u03c6_j} tune internal reflectivities & phases.  \n  \u2022 Detectors: number\u2010resolving detectors on all output modes 0\u20138.  \n  \u2022 Outcome classification: define a set of M detector\u2010click patterns {C_k} and a linear post\u2010processing function f(C_k; \u03b1) that maps frequencies p_k to W_est = \u03a3_k \u03b1_k p_k.\n\n3. Variational Training Loop  \n  1. Pick a training set of known three\u2010photon states {\u03c1_i} spanning GHZ, W, and separable classes; compute their true three\u2010tangles \u03c4_i offline.  \n  2. For each \u03c1_i and fixed \u03b8, run many trials: collect click frequencies p^{(i)}_k. Compute W_est^{(i)}(\u03b8,\u03b1) = \u03a3_k \u03b1_k\u2009p^{(i)}_k.  \n  3. Define loss L(\u03b8,\u03b1) = \u03a3_i [W_est^{(i)}(\u03b8,\u03b1) \u2212 \u03c4_i]\u00b2.  \n  4. Use a classical optimizer (e.g. gradient\u2010free or simultaneous perturbation) to update {\u03b8,\u03b1} and *minimize* L.  \n  5. Iterate until convergence, yielding a trained circuit U(\u03b8*) and coefficients \u03b1*.\n\n4.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought:\n  Step 1: We need a *network\u2010only* target (no raw state generation) that (i) exploits a *genuine multipartite entanglement* property of unknown inputs and (ii) embeds a *variational quantum algorithm* to *learn* a measurement mapping.  \n  Step 2: Brainstorm three ideas:\n    \u2022 A variational GHZ\u2010basis analyzer (too close to prior analyzers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010router (too similar to previous routers).  \n    \u2022 A variational entanglement\u2010witness measurement device: learn a linear\u2010optical circuit that, given one copy of an unknown three\u2010photon state, outputs click frequencies from which one can *estimate* the three\u2010tangle (a genuine tripartite\u2010entanglement measure).  \n  Step 3: The *witness measurement* is most novel: it\u2019s purely a *measurement network* that \u201ccomputes\u201d a nonlinear entanglement witness from one copy + ancillas, using a VQA to approximate the ideal function.  \n  Step 4: Novelty:\n    \u2013 No prior Pytheus experiment has targeted *learning* a genuine\u2010multipartite\u2010entanglement witness via a hybrid quantum\u2010classical photonic network.  \n    \u2013 We aren\u2019t generating any special state; we are *measuring* an unknown input\u2019s three\u2010tangle with a programmable photonic circuit.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:\n    \u2013 Uses only probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources for ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements (BS/phases as tunable parameters), number\u2010resolving detectors, and an offline classical optimizer.  \n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n    \u2013 Pytheus can model the abstract three\u2010tangle loss_function and optimize the circuit.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose a **Variational Photonic Genuine\u2010Multipartite Entanglement Witness Device**:\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncnot23_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a CNOT(2,3) gate, which means that we have a control qubit and the gate acts on a qutrit.\\n\\nIf the qubit is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target qutrit.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, we add 1 (mod 3) to the mode of the qutrit.\\n\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\'.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'in_nodes\\' being [0,1] expresses that the first two numbers are the incoming particles.\\n\\nthe value for the keyword \\'out_nodes\\' being [2,3] expresses that the third and fourth numbers are the outgoing particles.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"0202\" means |02> --> |02>\\n    \"1011\" means |10> --> |11>\\n    \"1112\" means |11> --> |12>\\n    \"1210\" means |12> --> |10>\\n\\nThis transformation requires four ancillary photons which are created from single photon emitters.\\n\\nWe introduce the single photon emitters with the keyword \"single_emitters\".\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nincoming: [0 control qubit][1 target qutrit][4 anc. sps][5 anc. sps][6 anc. sps][7 anc. sps]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [2 out][3 out][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nWe set \"heralding_out\" to true so that the correct operation of the gate is signaled (heralded) when the ancillary detectors click.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.
