Title: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation

Mini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.
