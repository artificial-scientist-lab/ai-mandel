Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I must provide a valid Pytheus JSON that matches the topology‐protected purification idea, ensuring the mode numbering, ancilla detectors, removed_connections, num_anc, out_nodes and target_quantum align with the SSH‐chain protocol.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates Pytheus expects the union of all node‐indices appearing in in_nodes, single_emitters and out_nodes to exhaustively cover the set {0,…,N–1}, where N is the length of each ket in target_quantum. Here target_quantum=["00","11"] so N=2 and we must list both 0 and 1 in that union. Since we are generating a Bell pair with no ancillas or inputs beyond SPDC sources, we simply need out_nodes=[0,1] (all nodes) and no in_nodes or single_emitters. We'll drop ancilla/SPDC details for now to satisfy Pytheus, keep target_quantum, and use a pure‐state fidelity loss.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict was that Pytheus requires the union of all node indices (input, output, emitters) to cover exactly {0,…,N−1}, where N is the length of each ket in target_quantum. To build a genuine non‐local entanglement‐swapping style purification network, we must treat it as a measurement: four incoming modes (the two noisy Bell pairs), two SPDC pair‐sources (num_pre=2 → 4 ancilla photons), and removed_connections forbidding cross‐party sources. We measure all 4 input photons (in_nodes=[0,1,2,3]) plus the 4 ancillas, totaling 8 detectors. We then post‐select on the Bell‐measurement outcomes (target_quantum includes the four patterns for successful swap), and removed_connections forbids sources between the two parties. This matches the entanglement‐swapping primitive, which underpins the purification.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Reformulate the protocol as a qubit‐level entanglement‐swapping purification, matching Pytheus’s expectations: two SPDC sources (`num_pre=2`), four ancilla photons (`num_anc=4`), no specified `in_nodes` or `out_nodes` so all four detectors (0–3) are used, forbidden cross‐party links via `removed_connections`, and target click patterns for a successful Bell‐swap.
