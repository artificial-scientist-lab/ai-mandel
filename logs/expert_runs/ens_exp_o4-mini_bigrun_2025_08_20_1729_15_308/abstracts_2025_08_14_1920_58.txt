Title: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits

Mini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel 𝔅 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.
