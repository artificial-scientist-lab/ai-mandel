}###Title: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)

Abstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green’s function G^(4)=⟨c_i^† c_j^† c_k c_l⟩ in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011⟩ and |1100⟩ (heralding projections onto the even “+1” and odd “−1” correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.
