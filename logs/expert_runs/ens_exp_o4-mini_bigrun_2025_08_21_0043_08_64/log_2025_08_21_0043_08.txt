    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: You have access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. \nThis target could be a measurement, transformation, or protocol that is applied to quantum states.\nYour colleague is trying to come up with interesting and novel targets that you can search for. \nIf you are successful your collaboration in implementing a novel idea in quantum optics that would be a great scientific achievement.\nConvert the idea to a working configuration file and run it by calling the tool.\n\nMake sure that you provide the correct input to the tool. It is essential that the parameters you put into the configuration for pytheus actually match the description of the experiment. Be aware of this even during multiple rounds of modifications.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE IS TO FIX BUGS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION, UNDER ABSOLUTELY NO CIRCUMSTANCES MODIFY THE TARGET TO MAKE THE IMPLEMENTATION EASIER!!! FOCUS ON FIXING THE BUGS, BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE CONFIGURATION YOU PROVIDE TO THE TOOL STAYS 100 PERCENT TRUE TO THE SUGGESTION MADE BY THE RESEARCHER!!!\n\nWhen you are finished and successfully implemented the idea, return the configuration and say Final Answer.\n\nYou have access to the tool: pytheus\n\npytheus:\nPytheus can design new experiments for quantum state transformations, quantum communication protocols, quantum measurements. The experiments are done with photons, often using SPDC or single-photon sources and single-photon detectors, coincidence detections.\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n4) If you want to create non-local experiments, such as entanglement swapping or quantum networks, the key in the json 'removed_connections' must contain edges that define vertices which should not share a common source. (Otherwise, if removed_connections is empty, everything could be at one location and could have interacted with each other before. of course in entanglement swapping, there are unallowed connections, thats the point of entanglement swapping).\n\nThe configuration file for running the tool defined through the following key words:\n* description: a short description of what the experiment is/does\n* target_quantum: this defines the target measurement, transformation, or protocol and is one of the most critical components in the search. `target_quantum` is specified as a list of kets. For fock (photon number) states, it lists only photon counts per mode, such as [[3,0], [0,3]] representing a three-photon, two-mode NOON state. In contrast, for regular states with constant photon numbers and specific modes, target_quantum is given as a list of strings like [\"30\", \"03\"].\n* samples: number of optimization runs (samples=1 for simple tasks, larger for more difficult tasks)\n* optimizer: name of the scipy optimizer to be used\n* loss_func: this is the function pytheus optimizes to reach the target, and it determines whether the `target_quantum` is treated in the Fock basis or discrete variable basis. For Fock states, loss_func uses 'fockfid' or 'fockcr'. For discrete variable states, loss_func uses 'fid' (fidelity), 'cr' (count rate), 'ent' (entanglement) and 'lff' ('lff' is for a custom loss function).\n* num_anc: number of ancilla photons added to realize the target. Try to reason about how many ancillary particles you will need. Too many and the optimization will take very long, too few and it may not be possible to realize the target.\n* edges_tried and tries_per_edge: parameters for topological optimization\n* amplitudes (optional): a list of coefficients/amplitude for the kets. if none are given, they are assumed to be all 1.\n* imaginary  (optional): determines if coefficients are given in real or complex format. default is real numbers ('false'), otherwise 'cartesian' or 'polar' (which implies 'true').\n* in_nodes (optional): for quantum gates and measurements, there can be incoming photons. this list of numbers determines at which position they are. default is empty (no incoming).\n* out_nodes (optional): sometimes it needs to be specified which photons are the outgoing photons. if this is left empty, it is assumed that all photons of the target quantum are outgoing.\n* heralding_out (optional): if this is set to true, only the ancilla photons are detected, meaning that the out_nodes remain undetected, which is good to have if we want to use the state further instead of being destroyed. default is false (all photons detected)\n* single_emitters (optional): single photon emitters are an experimental resource that can be used for many experiments. this list defines their position. default is empty (no single photon emitters)\n* removed_connections  (optional): for some tasks we might want to specify paths, which should not share a common source. this is done in a list of pairs. default is empty (no restrictions)\n* number_resolving (optional): we can specify to use number resolving detectors. this gives additional information, because regular detectors can only distinguish between no photon or at least one photon.\n* thresholds (optional): These are the values the loss function has to go below to be considered good enough. Higher values accept/tolerate more solutions. Example values for loss_func 'fid' are [0.1, 1] and for loss_func 'cr' are [0.3, 0.1].\n\nExamples of config files sometimes contain keywords which have values that are null or empty lists. These can be considered to be optional or dynamically set.\n\nHere are some existing examples of experiments implemented with pytheus ### EXAMPLE 1 ###\ncontrolled_z_post_sp\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create a post-selected controlled Z gate, which means that we have a control qubit acting on a target qubit.\\n\\nIf the control photon is in mode 0, nothing happens to the target photon.\\nIf the qubit is in mode 1, the target photon is given a phase shift of pi.\\n\\nWe express this transformation in the key word \\'target_quantum\\' and \\'amplitudes\\'.\\n\\nWe can read the value for \\'target_quantum\\'\\n\\n    \"0000\" means |00> --> |00>\\n    \"0101\" means |01> --> |01>\\n    \"1010\" means |10> --> |10>\\n    \"1111\" means |11> --> |11>\\n\\nThe value of \\'amplitudes\\' is [1.0,1.0,1.0,-1.0].

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nEND ABSTRACT\n\nHere is the full description of the idea given by the Researcher:\nSTART SUGGESTION\nThought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to knit together \u201ccoherent Rabi oscillation\u201d and \u201cultrastrong coupling\u201d into a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum\u2010network target, avoiding pure state generation and staying within linear\u2010optical, ancilla\u2010assisted, post\u2010selected experiments:\n  1.  Implement a heralded, tunable partial\u2010SWAP gate U(\u03b8)=cos\u2009\u03b8\u2009I+i\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8\u2009SWAP on two photonic qubits.  The Rabi\u2010oscillation analogy is the \u03b8\u2010dependent population exchange; the ultrastrong\u2010coupling analogy is pushing \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP) or beyond (multi\u2010photon excitations).  Then chain such partial\u2010SWAP gates across 3 or more parties to realize a \u201cquantum\u2010bus\u201d network: excitation injected at node A coherently Rabi\u2010oscillates across the chain to node C via ultrastrong\u2010coupled links.\n  2.  Design an entanglement\u2010swapping network in which the Bell\u2010measurement beamsplitter reflectivities are set to cos\u2009gt, sin\u2009gt, simulating time\u2010dialed coherent exchange.  By post\u2010selecting on ancillary detectors, simulate counter\u2010rotating (two\u2010photon) terms characteristic of ultrastrong coupling.  This gives a teleportation\u2010through\u2010Hamiltonian protocol, generalizable to multiple segments.\n  3.  Build a three\u2010node \u201crouter\u201d where nodes A\u2013B and B\u2013C each interact via a heralded controlled\u2010rotation whose angle mimics Rabi oscillation.  By tuning the \u201ccoupling angle\u201d \u03b1 at B, one can explore regimes from weak to ultrastrong (\u03b1\u2192\u03c0/2) and observe how entanglement swapping fidelity propagates or breaks down.\nStep 2: \n\u2013 Option 1 is the cleanest: the partial\u2010SWAP gate is a well\u2010known Rabi\u2010exchange analogue, but an actual photonic partial\u2010SWAP with heralding has never been demonstrated; ultrastrong coupling is captured by large\u2010angle regimes.  \n\u2013 Option 2 veers into simulating Hamiltonian evolution, more complex for Pytheus since it must realize specific two\u2010photon terms.  \n\u2013 Option 3 is a network generalization of option 1 but adds little new beyond chaining.\nStep 3: Pick Option 1.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because nobody has asked Pytheus to engineer a heralded, tunable linear\u2010optical partial\u2010SWAP gate as a building block for entanglement\u2010routing; connecting the gate angle to coherent Rabi oscillation and pushing it into the ultrastrong (\u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2) regime is a fresh conceptual twist on both analog quantum simulation and quantum\u2010network design.\nStep 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because:\n  \u2022  Pytheus can design linear\u2010optical networks that implement small unitaries with ancillas and post\u2010selection.  \n  \u2022  A partial\u2010SWAP on two qubits is a 4\u00d74 unitary, well within scope.  \n  \u2022  The ancilla resources (probabilistic pair sources or single\u2010photon emitters plus number\u2010resolving detectors) are standard Pytheus ingredients.  \n  \u2022  No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed; one static passive network suffices for each \u03b8.  \n  \u2022  It directly generalizes to multi\u2010node chains for entanglement\u2010swapping or teleportation\u2010through\u2010bus protocols.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose to task Pytheus with designing a heralded, tunable linear-optical partial-SWAP gate U(\u03b8)=cos\u2009\u03b8\u2009I + i\u2009sin\u2009\u03b8\u2009SWAP acting on two photonic qubits (modes). This gate embodies coherent Rabi oscillation (population exchange between |10\u27e9 and |01\u27e9 at \u201cangle\u201d \u03b8) and in the limit \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 realizes the ultrastrong-coupling analogue (a full SWAP).  \n\nGeneral network structure:\n  \u2022  Two input qubit modes A, B (each dual-rail or polarization-encoded).  \n  \u2022  A set of ancillary photon\u2010pair sources (or single\u2010photon emitters) feeding auxiliary modes.  \n  \u2022  A static linear-optical interferometer (beam splitters and phase shifters) optimized to implement U(\u03b8) on A,B conditional on detecting photons in ancilla detectors.  \n  \u2022  Number-resolving heralding on ancilla detectors to post-select successful partial-SWAP events.  \n\nVisualization:\n  emitters/sources \u2500\u2500\u25b6 interferometer network \u2500\u2500\u25b6 detectors  \n                            \u2198  \n                             \u21b3 outputs: qubits A\u2032, B\u2032 (realizing U(\u03b8)\u2009|\u03c8\u2090\u2097\u209a\u2095\u2090\u03b2\u27e9)  \n\nOnce the building block is found, generalize by chaining N such partial\u2010SWAP links between nodes 1\u2026N+1 to form a multi-node \u201cquantum bus.\u201d One injects an excitation at node 1 and measures its coherent Rabi-oscillation\u2013style transfer through ultrastrong\u2010coupled links to node N+1, or use the chain for ultra-fast entanglement swapping/teleportation across many nodes.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting and generalizable:\n  \u2022  Serves as both a fundamental demonstration of tunable photonic partial-SWAP (never done heralded).  \n  \u2022  Conceptually maps coherent Rabi oscillations and ultrastrong coupling regimes to linear-optical quantum networks.  \n  \u2022  Forms a modular building block for larger networks: routers, simulators of many-body ultrastrong coupling, time-dialed entanglement distribution.  \n  \u2022  Independent of whether physically implemented; the theory alone (showing that arbitrary \u03b8 partial-SWAP can be realised with minimal ancillas) is Phys. Rev.
