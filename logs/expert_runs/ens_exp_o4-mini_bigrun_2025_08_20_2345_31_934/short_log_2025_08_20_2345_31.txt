PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates that node 0 cannot be both an input and a single-emitter. To satisfy Pytheus’s requirement, I’ll remove 0 from in_nodes so that single_emitters=[0] and in_nodes=[1,2,3,4] are disjoint.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (8) does not match number of in/out nodes (3 in + 4 out).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The conflict arose because the path qubit was declared both as an input node and a single-emitter. To satisfy Pytheus’s requirement that in_nodes and single_emitters be disjoint while preserving the original target, I will remove the single_emitters entry.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates we need at least as many ancilla detectors as (in_nodes + single_emitters – out_nodes) = 5 – 3 = 2. We require four ancilla detectors for the two parity checks, so num_anc must be 4. We’ll leave single_emitters empty, keep in_nodes=[0,1,2,3,4] and out_nodes=[5,6,7]. Total nodes = 5 in + 4 anc + 3 out = 12, so target_quantum strings must be length 12.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (12) does not match number of in/out nodes (3 in + 5 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error stems from incorrect target string length after increasing num_anc. Restoring target strings to length 8 (in_nodes + out_nodes = 5 + 3) and setting num_anc=4 resolves the mismatch while preserving the intended static superposition target.
