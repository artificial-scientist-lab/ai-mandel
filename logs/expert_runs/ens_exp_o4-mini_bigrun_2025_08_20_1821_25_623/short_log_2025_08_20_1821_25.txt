Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to encode the router as a discrete-variable transformation mapping the dual-rail input qubit onto a superposition of two output rails. I’ll treat the two output rails (modes 2,3) as the “location qubit” and map each input basis state to the equal superposition of those location modes. I’ll use four ancilla photons for the two Bell measurements (post-selected) and no single-emitters.
