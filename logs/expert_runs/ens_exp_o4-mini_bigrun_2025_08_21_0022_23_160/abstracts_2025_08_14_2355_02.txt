Title: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla

Abstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer—decomposed into three optimized beam splitters—to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (Φ⁺, Φ⁻, Ψ⁺, Ψ⁻) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.
