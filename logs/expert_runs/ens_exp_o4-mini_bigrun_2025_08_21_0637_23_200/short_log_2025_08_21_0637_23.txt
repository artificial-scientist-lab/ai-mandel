Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed BE-ER layer cannot be encoded without an explicit list of the 2⁸→2⁴ basis mappings for the MERA isometry. Pytheus demands a concrete `target_quantum` list. I'll emit the configuration with a placeholder `target_quantum` array so that the researcher can supply the exact input→output mapping.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: IndexError: list index out of range
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because `target_quantum` is empty, leading to an index out-of-range. Pytheus requires at least one mapping. I'll add a minimal placeholder mapping (`'00000000'`→`'0000'`) with amplitude `1.0` so the config is syntactically valid; the researcher can later replace it with the full MERA mapping.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Number of target nodes (12) does not match number of in/out nodes (4 in + 0 out).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The mismatch was due to empty or mis-numbered in/out nodes. I’ve corrected the node assignments so that the mapping string has 8 input + 4 output bits, and included ancilla detectors.
