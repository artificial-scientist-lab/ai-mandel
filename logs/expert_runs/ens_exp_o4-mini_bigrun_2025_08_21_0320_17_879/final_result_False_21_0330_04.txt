Final Answer###Title: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus

Abstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.
