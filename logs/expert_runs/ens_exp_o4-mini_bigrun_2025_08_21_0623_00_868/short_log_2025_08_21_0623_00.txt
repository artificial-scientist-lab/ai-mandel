Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to convert the measurement‐based anyon‐braiding Hadamard gate into a Pytheus configuration without altering the logical target. I will specify a dual‐rail qubit teleportation channel mapping |0>→|+>, |1>→|–> using a 3×3 Bell‐pair lattice, four PEPS Bell‐modules plus four path‐swapping modules, and a single data‐qubit emitter.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters. I’ll place the data‐qubit emitter at node 0 and use nodes 1–2 for the dual‐rail input and nodes 3–4 for the dual‐rail output. I’ll specify the Hadamard map with four target strings and correct amplitudes, use eight SPDC ancilla photons, and herald the outcome.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0)), ((0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0), (11, 0), (12, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The “logical Hadamard” map requires sending basis states to superpositions, but Pytheus’s discrete‐variable gate encoding only supports permuting basis inputs into single basis outputs (possibly with phases). Trying to force multiple output kets per input also leads to an odd total photon count and unmatched perfect matchings. In short, Pytheus cannot realize a non-diagonal channel that sends |0⟩→(|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 and |1⟩→(|0⟩−|1⟩)/√2 because the target_quantum format only supports one output basis string per input. We must therefore conclude that this logical-Hadamard‐via-braiding experiment, while conceptually valid, is not implementable in Pytheus’s current framework.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The odd total photon number and overlapping in_nodes/single_emitters caused the matching failure. Keeping the original target mapping and single_emitter at node 0, I adjust num_anc to 7 to ensure an even total of 12 photons, and specify the missing parameters.
