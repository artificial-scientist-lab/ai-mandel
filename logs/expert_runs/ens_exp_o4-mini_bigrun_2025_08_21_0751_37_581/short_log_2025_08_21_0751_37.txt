Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The provided config mislabels in_nodes and out_nodes (it included SPDC modes incorrectly). For the CNOT mapping, only the two unknown qubit inputs and the two remote outputs belong in target_quantum. Thus set in_nodes=[0,1] (control, target inputs), out_nodes=[2,3] (remote C_out, T_out), num_anc=4, heralding_out=true, single_emitters=[0,1], and leave SPDC ancilla implicit, so that len(in_nodes)+len(out_nodes)=4 matches the 4‐digit target strings.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus requires in_nodes and single_emitters to be disjoint. We'll omit single_emitters and treat all photons—from both the unknown inputs and the SPDC pairs—in the abstract. We keep in_nodes as [0,1] for control and target, out_nodes [2,3] for the remote outputs, num_anc=4 for the Bell‐measurement clicks, heralding_out=true, and the CNOT mapping in target_quantum.
