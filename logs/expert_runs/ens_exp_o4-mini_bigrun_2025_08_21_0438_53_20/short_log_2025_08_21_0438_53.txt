Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configurations for both the trivial and topological quadrupole‐swap experiments are ready and adhere strictly to the researcher's proposal, so I will invoke pytheus with both setups.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: Loss function not specified in config file. Needs to be specified by 'loss_func' key.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because pytheus expects a single experiment config rather than a nested object. I'll first invoke pytheus with only the trivial‐phase configuration.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Pytheus requires node labels to be contiguous 0…N−1, so I must relabel the two corner modes 0 and 8 to nodes 0 and 1 in a minimal two‐node experiment. I’ll capture the corner teleportation as a heralded identity gate mapping qubit at node 0 to node 1, with two Bell swaps as four ancilla detectors. I keep the target_quantum ["00","11"], in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1], num_anc=4, heralding_out=true, and drop removed_connections for this minimal test.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: KeyError: 'tries_per_edge'
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous error was due to a missing `tries_per_edge` key. I’ll fix the minimal corner‐to‐corner teleportation configuration by adding `tries_per_edge` and keep the rest unchanged, so the nodes are contiguous and the loss function is specified.
