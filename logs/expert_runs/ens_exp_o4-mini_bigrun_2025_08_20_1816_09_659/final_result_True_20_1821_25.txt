}###Title: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements

Mini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz’s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.
