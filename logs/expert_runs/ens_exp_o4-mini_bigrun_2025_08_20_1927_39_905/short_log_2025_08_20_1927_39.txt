Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now faithfully encodes a static LOQC teleportation network mapping |000⟩→|0000⟩ and |111⟩→|1111⟩ with 3 input modes (0–2), 4 output modes (3–6), 4 ancilla photons heralded on detectors 7–10, enforcing no SPDC across Alice/Bob via removed_connections, and using photon-number-resolving detectors. Ready to run Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0), (5, 0), (6, 0), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (7, 0), (8, 0), (9, 0), (10, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error indicates an odd total photon number prevents any perfect matching under 'cr'. Switching to a fidelity-based loss function ('fid') for the discrete-variable code-conversion mapping avoids the parity constraint. I’ll change loss_func to 'fid' and keep the rest of the target configuration intact.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The parity error arises because the total number of photons (3 inputs + 4 outputs + 4 ancilla) is odd, so no perfect matching exists. To fix this bug, we add one trivial ancilla photon (num_anc = 5), bringing the total to 12, which is even, while keeping the target mapping unchanged.
