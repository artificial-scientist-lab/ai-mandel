Title:  
Heralded Static LOQC Conversion from 3-Qubit Repetition Code to 2×2 Toric-Code Patch

Mini-abstract:  
We design a purely static linear-optical teleportation network that transforms an unknown logical qubit encoded in the 3-qubit repetition code at Alice (modes 0–2) into a logical qubit encoded in a minimal 2×2 toric-code patch at Bob (modes 3–6). By using two Bell-pair ancilla sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and photon-number-resolving detectors—and enforcing “removed_connections” to prohibit direct emission—successful heralding on detectors 7–10 effects the target mapping |000⟩→|0000⟩ and |111⟩→|1111⟩ without active feed-forward.
