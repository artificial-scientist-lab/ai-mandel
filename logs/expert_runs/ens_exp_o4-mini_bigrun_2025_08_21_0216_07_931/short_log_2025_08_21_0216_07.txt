Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I will encode the ring‐swapped three‐mode interferometer as a pure post-selected measurement network.  We model the three SPDC links as six ancilla photons, perform the three Bell swaps by post-selecting on all six ancilla detectors clicking, and then feed the remaining three modes (with unknown phases imprinted) into a 3×3 linear-optical multiport whose negotiated click-pattern reproduces the three pairwise cos (φᵢ−φⱼ) fringes.  We express the desired measurement as discriminating the eight three-qubit GHZ-like basis states that carry those phase differences, so our target_quantum is the set of eight strings for |000⟩,…,|111⟩; we herald on the six ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true) and optimize the final multiport.
