Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to translate the proposed three‐destination teleportation Choi state into a proper Pytheus configuration. I’ll list the six 4‐mode bitstrings mapping input basis states |0> and |1> into recipients C, D, E, choose 6 ancilla photons for the Bell branches, use fidelity loss on discrete basis, and set up heralding on the six detectors (heralding_out true).  
Action: pytheus
