Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The suggested configuration mixes node indices for sources and detectors that Pytheus’s removed_connections cannot enforce. To correctly implement a heralded Bell‐state generation (post‐selected teleportation) with three SPDC ancillas, I will treat [0,1] as the two output (undetected) modes, set heralding_out=true, remove backward hops between these two outputs via removed_connections=[[0,1]] to enforce they don’t share a common source, and keep num_anc=3, out_nodes=[0,1], no in_nodes, and the other optimization parameters.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket. The target kets are [((0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 0), (3, 0), (4, 0))]. There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because an odd total photon number prevents perfect matchings, so I must use an even number of ancilla photons and treat this as a discrete‐variable Bell‐state (fidelity) target. I’ll double the ancillas to six and switch the loss function to “fid”.
