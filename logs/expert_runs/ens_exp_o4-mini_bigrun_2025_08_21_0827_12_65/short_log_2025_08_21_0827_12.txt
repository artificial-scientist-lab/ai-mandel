Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration faithfully encodes a heralded on-chip GHZ⁺ analyzer for three photonic qubits via Hong–Ou–Mandel interferometry, using three SPDC Bell-pair sources, nine total detection modes (three inputs + six ancillas), number-resolving detectors, and no dynamic feed-forward. We leave connectivity unrestricted for topology optimization.

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because the total photon number (3 inputs + 6 SPDC ancillas = 9) is odd, preventing perfect matchings in the count-rate loss. To fix this, introduce one extra ancillary photon via a single-photon emitter so the total photon number becomes even (10). Also update num_anc to 7 accordingly.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The count-rate loss (‘cr’) fails on odd photon numbers due to graph matchings, so switch to fidelity loss (‘fid’) which handles discrete-variable projective measurements without requiring even parity. Restore num_anc to 9 and remove single_emitters.

We'll revert to a count-rate loss ('cr') and drop the amplitude list (Default equal weighting), matching the example pattern.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The repeated odd-photon parity errors indicate Pytheus can generate the GHZ⁺ projection only as a pure measurement supermap (no explicit SPDC ancillas) with an even total photon number. Following the ghz_analyzer_2d example, we use num_pre=1, num_anc=3 to measure the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector on three inputs.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The core issue was parity: count-rate loss needs an even total photon number. We restore a HOM-based GHZ⁺ analyzer by adding 3 Bell‐pair SPDC sources (6 photons) plus one single‐photon emitter (1 photon) for a total of 3 inputs + 7 ancillas = 10 photons (even). We list input nodes [0,1,2], single emitter at node 3, SPDC pre-sources at next nodes, and num_anc=7 detectors. We keep loss_func 'cr' and number_resolving.
