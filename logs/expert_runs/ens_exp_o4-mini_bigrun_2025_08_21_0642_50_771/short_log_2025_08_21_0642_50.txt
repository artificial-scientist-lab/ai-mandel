Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The experiment is a one-shot three-photon repetition‐code–assisted teleportation network.  We need to preserve the logical qubit |0⟩+e^{iφ}|1⟩ from node A to node C_out by encoding on three carriers, teleporting via three Bell analyses at B, then a majority‐vote decoding at C.  In Pytheus terms this is a discrete‐variable transformation from a single‐qubit input to a single‐qubit output.  We'll specify a two‐bit target mapping ["00","11"], place the input on node 0 and output on node 1, introduce six ancilla photons (three SPDC pairs) for the three teleportations, forbid any direct A→C connection via removed_connections, and use `loss_func='fid'` to preserve phase coherence (hence lQFI).  No single‐photon emitters or additional feedback.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought:
We over‐specified inputs and removed_connections, causing Pytheus to fail. We need to correctly encode three input carriers (in_nodes=[0,1,2]), one logical output (out_nodes=[3]), and supply six ancilla photons via SPDC (num_anc=6). We ask for a discrete‐variable fidelity optimization (loss_func='fid') to preserve the phase coherence of |0⟩+e^{iφ}|1⟩. We forbid any direct A→C channel by removed_connections=[[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]], allow Pytheus to design the three Bell‐measurement modules at B and the 3→1 majority‐vote decoding interferometer at C.
