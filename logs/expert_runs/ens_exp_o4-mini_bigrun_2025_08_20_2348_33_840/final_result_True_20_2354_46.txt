}###Title: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ₄ vs. Bell ⊗ Bell Entanglement Classes

Abstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits—distributed across mechanical↔optical↔magnonic nodes—reside in the GHZ₄ entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ₄ vs. Bell⊗Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.
