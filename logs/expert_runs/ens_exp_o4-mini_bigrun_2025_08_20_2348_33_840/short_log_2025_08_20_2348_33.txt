Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration faithfully encodes a static linear‐optics analyzer: four input qubits at nodes 0–3, four ancilla photons (from SPDC) at nodes implicitly 4–7, and two distinct click patterns—“00001100” (detectors 4&5) flags GHZ₄, “00000011” (detectors 6&7) flags two Bell pairs. Removed_connections prevents unwanted common sources between A↔D and B↔C. All photons are number‐resolving, no feed‐forward.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: removed_connections explicitly specified that a connection between two nodes should be removed, but the nodes are also in in_nodes or single_emitters. removed_connections is reserved for nodes that correspond to detectors (out_nodes or ancillary detectors).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust removed_connections to reference detector nodes (out_nodes) rather than input nodes. Map A→detector4, B→5, C→6, D→7 and forbid common sources between (4,7) and (5,6).
