SuggestionType: [100, 100, 100, 100]

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The user’s suggestion had minor inconsistencies in the ancilla accounting and unnecessary fields like `anc_detectors.` I will fix these by treating the six GHZ₃ photons as incoming, adding four ancillary photons (via `num_anc=4`), heralding only on the ancilla detectors, and leaving the four output modes undetected. I’ll remove the spurious `anc_detectors` field and ensure `in_nodes`, `out_nodes`, and `removed_connections` correctly enforce no common source among the four end nodes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because `in_nodes` overlaps with `out_nodes`. To fix this without altering the target, I will remove the `in_nodes` specification so Pytheus treats all photons as network‐generated, leaving `out_nodes` for the GHZ₄ modes disjoint.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The contiguity error arises because out_nodes span non‐contiguous indices. I’ll relabel the four GHZ₄ output modes to nodes [0,1,2,3], update removed_connections to forbid any common source among these, and leave in_nodes empty.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The main issue was treating ancilla detectors as explicit nodes and mis‐specifying in/out nodes. For state generation tasks, Pytheus infers all photons from SPDC, so we omit in_nodes/out_nodes and anc_detectors. The target has four output modes (0–3), forbid any common SPDC source among them via removed_connections, and set num_anc=4 for the heralding clicks.
