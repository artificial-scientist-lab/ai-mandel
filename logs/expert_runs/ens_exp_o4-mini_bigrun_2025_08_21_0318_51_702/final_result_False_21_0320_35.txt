}###Title:  
2×2 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  

Mini-Abstract:  
We target the implementation of a 2×2 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid’s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.
