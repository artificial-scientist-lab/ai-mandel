Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I’ll set up a heralded Bell‐state measurement between modes 0 and 2 (the A–C diagonal) conditioned on four ancilla detectors (4–7). The configuration uses four SPDC ancilla photons, number_resolving detectors, and post‐selection on ancilla + corner clicks to produce |00>+|11> at the corners.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that with only out_nodes [0,1] and no in_nodes or single_emitters, Pytheus now sees nodes {0,1} which is contiguous. I’ll set out_nodes=[0,1], anc_detectors at [2,3,4,5], forbid direct SPDC on the diagonal with removed_connections=[[0,1]], and target_quantum=["00","11"] to herald a |00>+|11> Bell state at corners A and C.
