Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration now accurately reflects the researcher’s proposal—a static linear optical network that, conditioned on which pair of ancilla detectors click, teleports either CNOT or SWAP onto atoms A and B, with inputs from atoms C, A, B (single_emitters), four ancilla photons, discrete-variable target, in_nodes/out_nodes set correctly, heralding only ancilla detectors. We can submit this to pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because we mistakenly listed input photons as single_emitters, which must be disjoint from in_nodes. In our scheme the input photons come from atoms (in_nodes), and ancilla photons come from SPDC (num_anc). Therefore we should remove the single_emitters field.
