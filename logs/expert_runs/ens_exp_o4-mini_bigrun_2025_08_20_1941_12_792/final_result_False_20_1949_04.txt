}###Title: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network

Mini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus’s linear-optics optimization framework.
