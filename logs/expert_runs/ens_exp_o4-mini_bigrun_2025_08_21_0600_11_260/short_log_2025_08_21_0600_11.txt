Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to generate a Pytheus config specifying a four‐photon joint measurement that postselects on the “butterfly” Bell outcomes for cross‐teleportation. Input photons in modes 0 and 1, ancilla in modes 2 and 3 from single‐photon emitters, measure all four (out_nodes empty), target Fock patterns ["1100","0011","1010","0101"], two ancilla photons, no removed connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and single_emitters must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters. Ancilla emitters must be disjoint from the input modes. I'll move ancilla modes out of in_nodes and list them in single_emitters only.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was with overlapping in_nodes and single_emitters and mismatched node counts. I’ll remove single_emitters and set in_nodes=[0,1] and out_nodes=[2,3] with two ancillas, defining a post‐selected two‐qubit identity (cross‐teleport) gate heralded by two ancilla clicks, matching the four‐click joint measurement.
