Directional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon‐Blockade Effects

Abstract:
We propose a three‐site entanglement‐swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non‐Hermitian “skin” localization enforced by removing all backward source–detector links and an on‐site Mott‐like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam‐splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target ∣00⟩+∣11⟩ state between a uniform “superfluid” regime and a gapped, localized “Mott” regime within a single linear‐optical setup.
