Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The SSH-style corner-to-corner Bell-pair configuration is now fully specified with two SPDC ancilla sources, heralded interior Bell measurements, and forbidden diagonal connections to enforce the 2×2 SSH topology. I'll submit this config to Pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because the union of input, emitter, and output nodes wasn’t a contiguous set from 0 to N in the fock‐space modes. I will recast the experiment as a 4‐mode Bell‐state generation, using two SPDC ancilla sources, forbidding the SSH‐diagonal links, and inject placeholder single photons on all four modes (in_nodes=[0,1,2,3]) so that the mode indices become contiguous. The target is the two-photon Bell state |1,0,0,1>+|0,1,1,0> across modes 0–3, heralded by clicks on the ancilla detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: num_anc < (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) - len(out_nodes)). Not enough ancillary detectors for the number of in_nodes and single_emitters. Each path entering via in_node or single_emitter needs to exit the setup somehow (in an out node or an ancillary detector).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous config failed due to insufficient ancilla photons. To satisfy Pytheus’s requirement num_anc ≥ (len(in_nodes) + len(single_emitters) − len(out_nodes)), I increase num_anc to 4, representing two SPDC sources producing four ancilla photons. This yields a contiguous set of nodes 0–3, with two output nodes [0,3] for the teleported Bell pair, and enforces the SSH adjacency through removed_connections.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The previous setups misaligned node indexing and ancilla counts. I’ll use a post‐selected entanglement‐swapping protocol: two SPDC pairs on modes (0–1) and (2–3), Bell‐annihilation on modes 1&2 (ancilla detectors), leaving a Bell state on modes 0&3. This uses no explicit inputs, two ancillary detectors, and generates the two‐photon Bell state |00>+|11> in dual‐rail: ["1001","0110"].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: For state generation, both in_nodes and out_nodes should be empty so Pytheus treats this as generating a four-mode, two-photon Bell state on modes 0 and 3, heralded by clicks on the four ancilla photons. We set num_anc = 4 (two SPDC pairs), forbid any diagonal SPDC sources via removed_connections, and post-select on ancilla (heralding_out=true).
