Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I corrected the output nodes to include the control, A and C modes ([0,1,4]), fixed the forbidden SPDC link to be between A (1) and C (4), and explicitly set imaginary to false.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The in_nodes and out_nodes overlap; I'll remove them to let Pytheus default outputs to all target photons and inputs to ancilla automatically

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust configuration to remove single photon emitters by modeling the control qubit as one half of an SPDC pair. Use three SPDC sources (ctrl–anc1, A–R1, R2–C), total 6 photons; outputs are ctrl (0), A (2), C (5), ancilla photons are the other three. Forbid any direct SPDC link between A and C via removed_connections [[2,5]].

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: To satisfy Pytheus’s requirements for node indexing I omit explicit in_nodes, out_nodes, and single_emitters so the tool assumes all three output modes are target modes. I forbid any SPDC link directly between modes A (1) and C (2) via removed_connections.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: At least one of the target kets can not be produced by the setup. This could be because there is no perfect matching or edgecover that produces this ket.

There are 0 total kets with non-zero contributions. Examples:  [] ... (truncated to max. 10 entries, (position, mode) tuples). If there are no kets with non-zero contributions, it could be because the number of total particles (main+ancilla) is odd and the target (e.g. fidelity or count rate) relies on finding perfect matchings of a graph with an odd number of nodes, which is not possible by definition.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Reformulate as a purely Fock‐state generation over six output modes (ctrl/A/C time bins) with four ancilla photons. Use loss_func "fockfid", target_quantum as four Fock kets, num_anc=4, no in_nodes or out_nodes so Pytheus defaults. Ensure removed_connections uses valid mode indices.
