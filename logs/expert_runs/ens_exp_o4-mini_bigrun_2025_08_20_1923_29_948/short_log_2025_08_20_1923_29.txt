Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Preparing the Pytheus configuration for the heralded entanglement-dimension adapter, keeping the target exactly as specified and adding ancilla, removed connections, heralding only ancilla and intermediate modes.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arose because in_nodes and out_nodes overlapped. For a heralded transformation, we only need to specify out_nodes (the surviving modes 0 and 3) and let all other modes be detected. I'll remove in_nodes and drop the invalid 'dims' field, keeping the target and heralding settings.

Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Adjust the configuration to include proper in_nodes for the two sources, keep only out_nodes for the surviving modes, and remove non‐supported fields. Ensure node indices are contiguous and match the target length.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error was due to overlapping in_nodes and out_nodes. To fix this, I’ll treat the two measured modes A₂ and B₁ as inputs (in_nodes = [1,2]) and the two surviving qubit modes A₁ and B₂ as outputs (out_nodes = [0,3]). This makes the union of in_nodes and out_nodes contiguous and disjoint. All other modes (ancilla photons) are implicitly detected.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was treating this as a gate on four modes. In fact we want a heralded state generation: two‐photon Bell state on nodes 0 and 1 from no incoming photons, with four internal ancillas and forbidding any SPDC source connecting those two final modes. We omit in_nodes and out_nodes so Pytheus assumes modes [0,1] are the unmeasured target outputs, and we set heralding_out=true. We adjust removed_connections to [[0,1]].
