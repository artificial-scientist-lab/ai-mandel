}###Title: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d→2 Bell State Conversion

Mini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ across modes A₁ (node 0) and B₂ (node 3). By mixing modes A₂ and B₁ with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.
