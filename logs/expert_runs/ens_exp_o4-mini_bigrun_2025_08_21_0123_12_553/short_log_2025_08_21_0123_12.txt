Expert (o4-mini): Thought: This configuration encodes three SPDC sources (two Bell-pair and one TMSV ancilla), mixes modes B, C, S1, S2 in a static network, heralds on four ancilla detectors, and leaves modes 0 and 3 unmeasured to realize a heralded Bell state |00>+|11>. It's ready for Pytheus optimization.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error arises because out_nodes [0,3] overlapped with in_nodes. We have no external inputs, so we clear in_nodes to an empty list. All remaining modes are either outputs or heralding ancilla detectors.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The issue was that the output qubits need dual-rail encoding across four modes (0–3), with heralding detectors on modes 4–7. We encode the Bell state |Φ+> = |01>_A|10>_D + |10>_A|01>_D as target_quantum = ["0110","1001"], set out_nodes=[0,1,2,3], anc_detectors=[4,5,6,7], and enforce contiguous nodes 0–7.
