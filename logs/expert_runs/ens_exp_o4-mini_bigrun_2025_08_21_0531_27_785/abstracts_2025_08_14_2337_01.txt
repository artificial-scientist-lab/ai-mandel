Title: Subspace-Multiplexed Entanglement Routing via OAM Parity Encoding

Mini-Abstract: We demonstrate a resource-efficient entanglement-routing experiment in which two qubit-Bell swaps (targeting the four classical patterns {0000, 0110, 1001, 1111}) are performed simultaneously in a single ancilla-assisted linear-optics circuit by exploiting orbital-angular-momentum parity subspaces.  A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A–D (even) and B–C (odd) parity Bell measurements.
