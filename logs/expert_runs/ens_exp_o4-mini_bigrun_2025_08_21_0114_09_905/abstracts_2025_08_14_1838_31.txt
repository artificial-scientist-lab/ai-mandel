Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.
