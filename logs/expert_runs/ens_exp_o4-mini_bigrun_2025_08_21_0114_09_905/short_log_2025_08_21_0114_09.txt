Expert (o4-mini): Thought: Recasting the SPBS Bell‐state analyzer as a static two‐photon transformation mapping unknown Bell inputs on modes 0&3 into distinct click‐patterns (“20”, “11”, “02”, “00”) on number‐resolving detectors at modes 1&2 while enforcing an SSH‐inspired NN topology via removed_connections. Call pytheus with this config.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: the union set of nodes from in_nodes, single_emitters, and out_nodes must be contiguous and start at zero (0, 1, 2, ... N where N is the number of nodes or the length of a ket in the target state).
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The error reveals that in_nodes and out_nodes must cover a contiguous set of mode indices starting from zero, matching the ket length in target_quantum. I’ll recast this as a two-mode Bell‐state analyzer: two inputs on modes [0,1], two-detector measurement, Fock targets ["20","11","02","00"], and drop removed_connections.
