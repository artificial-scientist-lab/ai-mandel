Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The configuration omits the required non-locality constraint that nodes A and D should not share a common source. I will add a removed_connections entry [[0,3]] to enforce entanglement swapping and then invoke pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`: 
Error Type: Exception
Error Message: ValueError: in_nodes and out_nodes must be disjoint.
This error indicates that there was an issue with the pytheus function. Please review the error type and message above to understand the problem. If possible, modify the input or parameters and try again.

DebuggingMessage: To figure out what went wrong you can try writing an explanation similar to what you were given for the examples in the very beginning. This might help you understand the problem better and see if there are any inconsistencies.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The nonlocality constraint and node labeling issues make discrete-variable encoding with in/out nodes error-prone. Instead, I’ll follow the entanglement‐swapping examples (ES_246) by using a pure state‐generation setup: no in/out nodes, discrete target strings, SPDC ancillas, and remove the common-source connection between the two output modes.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: I need to provide a valid top‐level JSON config dict with no overlapping in_nodes/out_nodes and enforce nonlocality via removed_connections. I’ll use no in/out nodes, set heralding_out=true to herald on ancillas only, num_anc=4 for two Bell measurements, removed_connections=[[0,1]] to prevent a common source for the two output modes, and then call pytheus.

PytheusError: Error encountered while executing `pytheus`:

Error Message: ValueError: 100 invalid preoptimization steps. Conclusion: State cannot be created with provides parameters. Consider adding more ancillas or using less restrictions if possible (e.g. removed_connections).

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The setup matches the entanglement‐swapping examples: no explicit in/out nodes, four ancilla photons for two Bell measurements, forbid a common source between the two output modes via removed_connections, and herald on the ancillas only.

Expert (o4-mini): Thought: The entanglement‐swapping sensor target is best encoded like the 4d‐ES example: discrete-variable entangled output (["00","11","22"]), only SPDC ancillas, no in/out nodes, heralding_out defaults to null, and enforce nonlocality with removed_connections=[[0,1]]. I’ll use num_anc=4, matching the 4d example, and call pytheus.
