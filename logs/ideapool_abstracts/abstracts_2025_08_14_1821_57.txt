Title: Ring‐Swapped Tri‐Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases

Abstract: We implement a closed‐loop network of three SPDC two‐mode squeezed‐vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts φA, φB, and φC at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS‐optimized 3×3 linear‐optical multiport with photon‐number‐resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | φA,φB,φC) exhibits interference fringes ∝ cos(φi − φj) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure‐measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences φA−φB, φB−φC, and φC−φA.
