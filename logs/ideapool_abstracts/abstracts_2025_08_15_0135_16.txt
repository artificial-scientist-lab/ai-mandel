Title: Topology-Dependent Entanglement Percolation on Cylinder versus Möbius Photonic Ladders

Mini-abstract: We implement measurement-based entanglement swapping on a four-rung photonic Bell-pair ladder with periodic (cylinder) and half-twisted (Möbius) boundary conditions to herald entanglement between nodes 0 and 4 using only probabilistic two-photon sources and local linear-optic Bell measurements. By optimizing ancillary beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in the Pythes framework, we directly quantify how the non-orientable Möbius topology alters the resource overhead and success fidelity required for remote entanglement distribution compared to the orientable cylinder.
