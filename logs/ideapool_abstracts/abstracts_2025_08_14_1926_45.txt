Title: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring

Mini‐abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target “Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,” in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement—an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.
