Title: Measurement-Induced Parity-Swap Repeater Node for Integrated Purification and Entanglement Swapping

Abstract: We propose a measurement-induced parity-swap repeater node that simultaneously enacts Z- and X-parity checks on the middle modes of two noisy Bell-pair inputs and performs a heralded entanglement swap in a single non-Hermitian supermap, thereby purifying both bit-flip and phase-flip errors in one shot. Our static interferometer design—using two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, two ancilla single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors—eliminates sequential purification and swap rounds, reducing communication latency and enabling resource-efficient, composable repeater chains.
