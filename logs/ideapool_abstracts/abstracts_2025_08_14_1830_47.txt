Title:  
Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering

Mini-Abstract:  
We present an all‐linear‐optical protocol, “Multi‐Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,” that fuses two Bell pairs A–B₀ and C₀–D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B₀ and C₀ through unknown multimode scattering channels U₁,U₂ with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla‐mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.
