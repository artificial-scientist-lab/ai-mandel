Title:
PT-Symmetric Gain–Loss Filter–Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT

Mini-Abstract:
We demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain–loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.
