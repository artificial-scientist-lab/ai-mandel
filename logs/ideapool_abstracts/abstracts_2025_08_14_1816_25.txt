Title: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits

Abstract: We propose and implement a post‐selected “quantum butterfly” network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits—|ψ⟩ at node A and |φ⟩ at node C—encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV–photon entanglement and a bespoke four‐click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.
