Title: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit

Mini–Abstract:  
We demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4×4 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.
