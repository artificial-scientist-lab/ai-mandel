Title:  
Corner-Protected Bell–Swap Teleportation in a 3×3 Photonic Quadruple-Insulator Lattice

Abstract:  
We implement a 3×3 photonic quadruple-insulator network to teleport quantum information between modes 0 and 8 via two successive Bell-state measurements, heralding the target Bell state |Φ⁺⟩₀₈ (i.e. “00”–“11”) through intermediate swaps on modes (1,4) and (4,7). By toggling between the “trivial” edge-bond connectivity (sources on outer edges) and the “topological” central-plaquette connectivity (sources on interior bonds), we compare heralded success probabilities—equivalent to effective teleportation fidelities—to directly probe the corner-mode protection predicted for higher-order photonic quadruple insulators.
