Title: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D

Abstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong–Ou–Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.
