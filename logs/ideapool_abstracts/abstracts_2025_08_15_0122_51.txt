Title: “Heralded Linear-Optical Implementation of the Distributed Three-Body Variational Phase Gate”

Mini-abstract: We propose and optimize in Pytheus a single-shot, heralded linear-optical network that enacts the distributed three-qubit variational phase gate U₃(φ)=exp[iφ Z_A⊗Z_B⊗Z_C] across spatially separated photon qubits (Alice, Bob, Carol) using only pair sources, single-photon inputs, beam splitters, and six ancilla Bell measurements. Upon six-fold coincidence detection, all Pauli by-products are absorbed into the known phase φ, yielding the desired 8×8 diagonal unitary without dynamic feed-forward.
