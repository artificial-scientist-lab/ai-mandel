Title:  
Zak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  

Mini-abstract:  
We propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.
