Title:  
Parity-Checked Multi‐Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High‐Fidelity A–D Link  

Mini-abstract:  
We implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A–B and C–D Bell‐pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high‐fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.
