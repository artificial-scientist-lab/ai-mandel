Title: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized π-Phase and Corner-State Localization

Abstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  
|10⟩→(|10⟩+e^{iϕ}|01⟩)/√2, |01⟩→(|01⟩−e^{iϕ}|10⟩)/√2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized π-phase jump in the interference fringes at ϕ=π. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux–corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.
