Title: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

Abstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A–B and B–C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ with a success rate scaling as 1−(1−p_source)^k.
