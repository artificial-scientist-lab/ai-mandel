Title: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch

Abstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic “superchannel switch” that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives—entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)—in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on “+” outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES→QT and QT→ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.
