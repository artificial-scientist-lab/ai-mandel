Title: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1→2 Qutrit Telecloner

Mini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1→2 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.
