Title: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination

Mini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT–symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.
