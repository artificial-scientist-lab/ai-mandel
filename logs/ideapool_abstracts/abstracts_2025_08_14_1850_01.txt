Title: “Quantum Battery–Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router”

Mini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a “quantum battery” to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.
