Title: Heralded Programmable Photonic Projector onto Two-Qubit Heisenberg Ground-State Manifolds

Abstract: We present a heralded, reconfigurable two-qubit linear-optical module that postselectively projects arbitrary photon-encoded qubit inputs onto the ground-state manifold of the tunable two-body Heisenberg Hamiltonian H(θ)=cos θ (σₓσₓ+σ_yσ_y)+sin θ σ_zσ_z—realizing the antisymmetric singlet subspace at θ=0 or the symmetric triplet subspace at θ=π/2. By using two ancilla photons, a four-mode interferometer with adjustable internal phases, and number-resolving detectors to signal success, the device achieves the target projection and can be chained via entanglement swapping to simulate and distribute spin-chain ground-state correlations across a fully programmable photonic network.
