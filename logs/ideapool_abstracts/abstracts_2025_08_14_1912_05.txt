Title:  
On‐Chip Three‐Photon Repetition‐Code Logical‐Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics

Mini‐Abstract:  
We propose and design an integrated silicon‐photonic circuit that implements an error‐detecting logical‐Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three‐photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach–Zehnder interferometer parity‐check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|Φ±⟩ₗ, |Ψ±⟩ₗ) while simultaneously heralding single‐photon loss errors via on‐chip photon‐number‐resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pythéus linear‐optics primitives.
