Title: Programmable Photonic Teleportation Router for Three Qubits

Mini-Abstract: We demonstrate a three-input/three-output linear-optical network—the Programmable Photonic Teleportation Router for Three Qubits—that, under a classical “program” of three static phase-shifter settings, permutes and teleports three unknown qubits from senders Alice₁, Alice₂, Alice₃ onto receivers Bob₍π(1)₎, Bob₍π(2)₎, Bob₍π(3)₎ for any π∈S₃. By combining three probabilistic EPR photon-pair sources, a programmable six-mode interferometer, and post-selected Bell measurements, this novel quantum-network primitive realizes fully programmable routing of unknown qubits without dynamic feed-forward or cavity resources.
