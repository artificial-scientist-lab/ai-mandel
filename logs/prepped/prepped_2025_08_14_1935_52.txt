Thought: The researcher’s suggestion describes a four-node square network Bell test using two independent static 4×4 Bell‐analyzer modules at nodes B and D. Pytheus can design the linear‐optical circuits for these two Bell measurements in parallel, treating each as a post‐selected transformation from the two incoming Bell‐pair photons plus ancillas to four orthogonal click patterns. We encode this as a single Pytheus experiment that takes the four photons at B and D (modes 4,1 at B; 8,6 at D), adds two ancilla photons, and maps each Bell‐state input at B and D to a distinct four‐click output. The eight outputs correspond to the two 4‐click patterns. We list all 16 combinations of the four B‐patterns and four D‐patterns as the `target_state`. Other fields follow standard Pytheus syntax.
