Thought: The researcher wants a static, heralded LOQC protocol that teleports a CNOT nonlocally via two Bell‐measurements, using SPDC pairs for entanglement links and single‐photon emitters for the unknown control/target qubits. Pytheus can optimize the central 4×4 interferometer to post‐select exactly the trivial‐Pauli‐correction branches of both Bell‐measurements, implementing the remote CNOT on two output modes while detecting only the four Bell‐measurement photons. We rephrase this as a gate‐transformation target: two incoming qubits (control, target) plus two incoming SPDC ancilla modes go through the interferometer, four detectors herald the successful teleportation, and the output modes carry the CNOT action. We encode this in Pytheus with in_nodes [0,1,2,3], out_nodes [4,5], target_state for CNOT, num_anc=4, heralding_out=True, single_emitters for the two input qubits, and let Pytheus optimize the beamsplitters/phases to maximize count‐rate (and hence entangling power) of the heralded branches.
