Thought: The proposed hybrid‐frequency triangle network is abstractly just three independent Bell‐pair sources and three local 2×2 interferometric analyzers (one per link) with six photon‐number‐resolving detectors. Pytheus treats all modes identically (no “optical vs THz”), so we encode it as a triple Bell‐state analyzer: three SPDC sources (num_pre=3), six detectors (num_anc=6), and target_state listing the 8 six‐bit patterns where each source’s two output modes are either both 0 or both 1. No single_emitters, no feedback. This sits within Pytheus’s discrete‐variable measurement synthesis, and the resulting setup can be used to collect the joint statistics needed for a triangle‐network inequality test.
