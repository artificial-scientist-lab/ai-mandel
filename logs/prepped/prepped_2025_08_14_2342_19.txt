Thought: We translate the repeater‐node idea into a static, post‐selected Bell‐state generator: two SPDC pair sources create four photons; two serve as ancillas in a 4-mode HOM+Bell‐measurement interferometer and two remain as the heralded outputs (A and D). We treat this as an entanglement‐generation task (`in_nodes` and `out_nodes` empty), target the 2-qubit Bell state `['00','11']`, use `num_anc=2` ancilla photons from SPDC, set `heralding_out=true` so that only the ancilla detectors click, and forbid any source that directly connects the two output modes via `removed_connections=[[0,1]]`. The rest of the optimization parameters follow standard Pytheus conventions.
