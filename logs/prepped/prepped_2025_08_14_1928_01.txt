Thought: The proposed device is a static measurement analyzer that uses two SPDC ancilla pair sources (4 ancilla photons) and PNR detectors to unambiguously herald the one‐excitation (W) subspace of three incoming qubit photons.  In Pytheus this reduces to a measurement scheme with in_nodes=[0,1,2], num_anc=4 (two SPDC sources), and target_state listing the 3 one‐excitation basis strings.  We set number_resolving=true, use a count-rate loss function, and leave out_nodes empty to indicate a measurement device.
