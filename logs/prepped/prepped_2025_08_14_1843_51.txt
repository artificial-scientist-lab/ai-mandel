Thought: The researcher’s proposal describes a reconfigurable three‐photon GHZ‐basis measurement device using ancilla heralding and EOM‐controlled phases. Pytheus cannot encode physical EOMs or dynamic switching, but it can design a static interferometer whose internal phases may be set externally. I will recast the idea as a static GHZ‐analyzer configuration that projects three unknown qubits onto the |000⟩+|111⟩ subspace, using two SPDC ancilla photons and three single‐photon inputs, with ancilla detectors heralding the successful projection. Reconfigurability is then understood as retuning external phase settings between runs.
