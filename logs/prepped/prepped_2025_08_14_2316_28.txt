Thought: The researcher’s square‐loop Z₂‐flux idea is well within Pytheus’s static linear‐optics domain—four SPDC pair sources on square edges, two Bell‐swap measurements as ancilla heralds at nodes 1 & 3, and a conditional Bell‐state at nodes 0 & 2 whose fidelity toggles with the total loop phase. I need to translate this into a valid Pytheus config: use num_pre=4 for the four probabilistic pair sources, no single emitters, forbid diagonal edges with removed_connections, set out_nodes=[0,2] so those modes remain undetected, ancilla detectors at nodes 1 and 3 with heralding_out=true, number_resolving detectors, and target_state as the single‐rail Bell superposition ["10","01"]. Then hand it off to Pytheus for optimization.
