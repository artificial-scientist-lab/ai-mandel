Thought: The researcher’s hybrid qubit–qutrit swap idea is novel but the draft config has mismatched keys (e.g. `target_quantum`) and doesn’t properly encode a 2×3 Bell‐pair in Pytheus’s discrete‐variable syntax. For a qubit encoded across 2 modes (0–1) and a qutrit across 3 modes (2–4), the swapped Bell state |0,0⟩+|1,2⟩ reads in Fock‐mode strings as “10100” and “01001”. We don’t need single emitters; the two SPDC pair sources are implicit. We forbid any direct 0–4 source to enforce the swapping. We’ll set `target_state` accordingly, leave `in_nodes`/`out_nodes` empty (all modes get measured), and specify two ancilla detections in the Bell measurement, with `num_anc=2`, `removed_connections=[[0,4]]`, number resolving detectors, and no heralding_out.
