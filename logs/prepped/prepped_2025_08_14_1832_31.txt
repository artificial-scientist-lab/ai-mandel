Thought: The proposal hinges on discriminating two unknown phonon‐to‐photon transducers treated as black‐box unitaries. However, Pytheus cannot optimize for unknown channels or compare two separate transformations—it only designs static LO networks to realize a single known mapping from defined input Fock states to target output states. As a result, channel discrimination against unknown unitaries falls outside its scope.
