Thought: The perceptron idea can be encoded as a non‐unitary two‐input → one‐output gate with a threshold mapping on basis states. We model it as a post‐selected transformation: inputs in modes 0,1 are sent through a static mesh with four ancilla photons; we herald on the four ancilla detectors and leave exactly one photon in mode 2 as the “neuron” output. By setting heralding_out=true, Pytheus only enforces the mapping between input modes [0,1] and output mode [2]. We specify the discrete target mapping “AND” (a simple threshold): |00>→|0>, |01>→|0>, |10>→|0>, |11>→|1>. Removed_connections forbid any direct 0/1→2 paths, so output only arises via the measurement‐induced activation. This stays fully within Pytheus’s static linear‐optics, SPDC ancilla, and number‐resolving detectors framework.
