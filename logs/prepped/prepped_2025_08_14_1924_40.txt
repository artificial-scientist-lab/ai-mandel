Thought: Pytheus cannot literally simulate Markovian vs non‐Markovian open channels, but we can capture the essence by building a static linear‐optical “teleportation” gate—i.e. a heralded identity on one qubit—where the input photon is split into two ancilla‐interaction paths (our stand-in for the two “channels”), recombined, and then teleported via a Bell pair.  We enforce the separation of the two paths with `removed_connections` and use single‐photon emitters to generate the input, the two halves of the EPR pair, and the ancilla photons.  The transformation we ask Pytheus to realize is the identity on the input qubit (teleportation), heralded by clicks on the ancilla detectors.

Explanation of key choices:  
• single_emitters = [0] is the input qubit, [1,2] are the two ancilla in the EPR pair (for teleportation), and [3,4,5] are the extra ancilla photons that couple to the two paths.  
• removed_connections blocks direct coupling of the input emitter into one ancilla path vs the other, enforcing the “superposition” of two disjoint ancilla‐interaction streams.  
• target_state is the identity mapping on three qubits (input + EPR pair → output + two measured ancillas), so post‐selection on all six detectors clicking implements teleportation.  
• heralding_out = true means we only detect the ancillas; the out_nodes [3,4,5] are left untouched for downstream use.
