Thought: The Researcher’s vision—a static, heralded “dihedral‐braiding” router on a triangular network—boils down to a probabilistic linear‐optical device that, upon ancilla clicks, applies one of several nontrivial permutations to a path‐encoded qudit.  Pytheus can realize the core primitive: a heralded cyclic permutation (Z₃ phase‐shift) on a 3-mode, single‐photon qutrit by using two SPDC ancilla photons and number‐resolving detectors.  While implementing the full non-Abelian S₃ with six outcomes would require more ancilla photons and detectors, this cyclic shift (three outcomes) is a minimal proof-of-principle that can be generalized to Dₙ.  Below is a cleaned-up Pytheus config for the heralded 3-mode cyclic‐shift router.
