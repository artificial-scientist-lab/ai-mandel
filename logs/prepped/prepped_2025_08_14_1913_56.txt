Thought: The researcher’s sketch uses a non‐standard keyword (“target_transformation”) and omits required fields like foldername and target_state. Pytheus expects a list of input/output basis mappings under target_state, in_nodes, out_nodes, a numeric num_anc for ancilla photons, and an explicit removed_connections list forbidding non–nearest‐neighbor SPDC links. I will reformulate their BE-ER layer as a post-selected isometry 𝑈:(ℂ²)^8→(ℂ²)^4, with all eight qubits sourced by SPDC (no in_nodes), four coarse-grained outputs left undetected (out_nodes), four ancilla photons consumed in the isometries (num_anc = 4), heralding_out=true, and removed_connections blocking any SPDC link beyond nearest neighbors.
