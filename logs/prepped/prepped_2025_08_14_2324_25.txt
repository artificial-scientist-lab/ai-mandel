Thought: The researcher’s proposal for a fully parametric, Choi‐spectrum–measuring partial-SWAP is too abstract for a straight Pytheus config (which cannot optimize a family U(θ) or embed a symbolic spectral readout).  A realistic Pytheus task is to design a static, heralded measurement network that takes two SPDC‐generated Choi copies of an unknown two-qubit channel and post-selectively projects onto its SWAP eigenmodes (i.e. measures the operator entanglement spectrum in one shot).  This “SWAP‐spectrum analyzer” uses two pair_emitters, four ancillas, and a 4-click detector signature that discriminates the two eigenvalues.  I will rephrase the suggestion accordingly, mapping the four click patterns onto the two swap eigenvalues.
