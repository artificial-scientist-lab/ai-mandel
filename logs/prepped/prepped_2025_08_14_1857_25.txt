Thought: The researcher’s “teleporter loop” can be encoded as a single‐qubit gate where one photon is injected at node 0, four SPDC pair sources provide 8 ancilla photons, and after sequential Bell measurements the photon returns at node 4 with a fixed Pauli by‐product. We capture the clockwise loop by choosing the target mapping to be the Pauli X gate on the qubit: |0>→|1>, |1>→|0>. We set num_anc=8 (four pair sources), in_nodes [0], out_nodes [4], and forbid each SPDC source from connecting to the nonadjacent analyzers via removed_connections. We ask Pytheus to optimize with loss_func="cr", number_resolving detectors, and post‐selection on the “X” outcome.
