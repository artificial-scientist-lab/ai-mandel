Thought: The Bell‐measurement supermap can be encoded as a static post‐selected measurement in Pytheus by treating the four detector click patterns as the target measurement events. We feed in two qubit inputs, one single‐photon ancilla, and a vacuum reference (4 modes total), detect on all 4 output ports, and post‐select the single‐click patterns “1000”, “0100”, “0010”, “0001”. By setting in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], out_nodes=[], num_anc=4, single_emitters=[2], and target_state to those four patterns with loss_func='cr' and appropriate thresholds, Pytheus will optimize a 4×4 unitary (built from three beamsplitters + phases) achieving a 62.5% success.
