Thought: The proposal is for a three‐copy linear‐optical “Schur analyzer” that projects unknown subsystem A across three copies onto the three irreps of S₃, yielding click patterns which encode Tr[ρ²] and Tr[ρ³]. To fit Pytheus’s measurement‐design format, we treat the three A‐copies as three input photons in modes 0,2,4, no additional ancilla photons (vacuum inputs only), and three number‐resolving detectors (num_anc=3) that register exactly one click in one of three detectors. We encode these three possible single‐click patterns as the target_state ["100","010","001"], in_nodes=[0,2,4], out_nodes empty, and use a count‐rate loss (cr) to postselect on those patterns. All other Pytheus parameters follow measurement‐analyzer examples.
