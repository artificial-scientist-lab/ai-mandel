Thought: The researcher’s idea is to reuse a single ancilla Bell pair across two time bins using a delay loop (“temporal coupled‐mode”) to perform back‐to‐back entanglement swaps. Pytheus can handle time‐bin dimensions and static loops. I will produce a Pytheus config that captures: two unknown qubit pairs in two time bins, a single ancilla pair, one loop for delay, number‐resolving heralded detection, and a placeholder list of two‐click patterns as the target measurement. This stays within Pytheus’s abstract photonic framework.
