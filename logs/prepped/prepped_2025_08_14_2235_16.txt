Thought: The proposed sequential, nondestructive KCBS network with tunable reflectivities goes beyond Pytheus’s static, post-selected, single-shot linear-optics paradigm (no dynamic routing or per-beam-splitter parameter knobs in the config).  Instead, we can capture the core novelty—a five-outcome POVM on a single photonic qutrit corresponding to the KCBS pentagon projectors—as a static analyzer.  In Pytheus terms, we take a single photon in three spatial modes (the qutrit) and map it into five detectors, one per KCBS projector outcome.  This is a genuine network-level primitive (a 3→5 measurement), not mere state generation or simple GHZ/W analyzers.  The network will use linear optics and post-selection to realize the five-outcome POVM in one shot.
