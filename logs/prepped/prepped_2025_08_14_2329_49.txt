Thought: The researcher’s proposal defines a novel four‐branch entanglement router controlled coherently by two polarization‐encoded qubits. To translate this into a Pytheus configuration, I must treat all photons (two single‐emitter controls + eight from four pair sources) as incoming nodes, designate the four “leaf” outputs as out_nodes, and the eight ancilla detectors as anc_detectors. I set num_anc=8, heralding_out=true, number_resolving=true, and include removed_connections to enforce the polarization‐routing constraints. No target_state is needed for a network primitive; instead I tag the task with a custom target_network field.
