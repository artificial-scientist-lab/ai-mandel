Thought: The researcher’s proposal is to use Pytheus to build a static linear-optical network that first simulates N layers of a discrete-time quantum walk (the Floquet band), then performs an entanglement-swap (Bell) measurement between time-shifted modes to extract the winding number. Pytheus can design the Bell analyzer and support repeated “loops” to represent the N walk layers. I will produce a configuration for a post-selected Bell-state projection module (“entanglement-swap analyzer”) with loops=4 to stand in for the 4 Floquet layers. This stays within Pytheus’s capabilities: abstract linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, loops, and a standard Bell measurement.
