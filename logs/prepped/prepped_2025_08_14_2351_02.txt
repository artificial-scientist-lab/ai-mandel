Thought: The original suggestion used unsupported fields like “target_network” and didn’t map cleanly onto Pytheus’s gate/measurement primitives.  We can cast the two‐hop swap as a single post‐selected measurement: the 4 photons held at the intermediate nodes (modes 0–3) enter a static 4­-mode interferometer and are all detected (ancilla).  The two end photons (modes 4 and 5) are left undetected—heralding_out=true—so that, upon a successful click pattern, they collapse into a Bell pair.  We ask Pytheus to maximize the entanglement (‘loss_func’=’ent’) on modes [4,5] with target_state=[“00”,”11”] and dimension [2,2].  This requires no dynamic feedback, only EPR sources, linear optics, and number‐resolving detectors.
