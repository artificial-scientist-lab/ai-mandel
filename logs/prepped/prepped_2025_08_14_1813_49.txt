Thought: The essence is to configure Pytheus to build a static linear‐optical network that realizes a closed‐loop teleportation around a 4‐site SSH ring and reads out a Zak phase as a count‐rate shift.  We’ll treat the four EPR links (SPDC sources) as ancilla photons, enforce ring connectivity via removed_connections, designate ancilla detectors for the four Bell measurements, and leave in_nodes/out_nodes so that the teleported qubit enters on mode 0 and exits on mode 1 for a final two‐mode interferometer.  Heralding is enforced by requiring all ancilla detectors to click.  The rest of the parameters follow standard examples.
