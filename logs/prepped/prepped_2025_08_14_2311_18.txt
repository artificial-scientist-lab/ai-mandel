Thought: We can encode the three‐photon repetition‐code teleportation as a post‐selected linear‐optical transformation.  Modes 0–2 carry the three copies of an unknown phase‐encoded qubit from Node A.  Three SPDC pair sources (six ancilla photons) link Node B and Node C: BSMs at B act on modes (0,3), (1,4), (2,5), and the matching SPDC partners (6,7,8) arrive at C.  We ask Pytheus to optimize both the three Bell analyzers at B and a 3→1 “majority‐vote” decoding interferometer at C, mapping (i₁,i₂,i₃) → majority(i)’ on a single undetected output mode (mode 8) while heralding on all other detectors.  By setting heralding_out=true, only the ancilla detectors click, leaving mode 8 as our logical output qubit.  The target_state enforces the bitwise majority map and thus preserves the φ‐coherence (maximizing local QFI) under dephasing.
