Thought: The researcher’s sketch mixes non‐official keywords (e.g. “pair_sources” and list‐valued heralding_out) and miscounts ancillas.  To stay compatible with Pytheus, I need to replace “pair_sources” by in_nodes (0–3), count only the two single‐photon emitters as num_anc, set out_nodes=[0,3] so A and D remain unmeasured (heralding_out=True), and use a simple two‐state Bell basis for target_state—["00","11"]. I’ll add the standard optim and loss parameters, keep number_resolving detectors, and include the researcher’s removed_connections to forbid any direct mixing between remote ends (0–3) or the middle pair (1–2).
