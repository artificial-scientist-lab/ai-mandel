Thought: The proposal is to build a single static parity‐analyzer circuit that measures all Z-plaquette stabilizers in a toric patch at once, sharing ancilla photons across neighboring plaquettes so that the total ancilla count scales with the patch perimeter rather than area. Pytheus can treat this as a multi-mode measurement (“analyzer”) where the input modes are the qubit photons, there are no out_nodes (all modes are detected into ancillas), and the target_state lists exactly those input Fock patterns that satisfy every plaquette’s Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄=+1 parity. For a simple 2×1 patch of two plaquettes (6 qubits, boundary length L=6), there are 16 such even‐parity input patterns. We then ask Pytheus to minimize num_anc (set to 6 for L), use a “cr” loss function, and optimize a 6-ancilla-detector interferometer. This stays within Pytheus’s capabilities—no hyperentanglement, no feedback control, purely static linear‐optics with probabilistic pair sources and number-resolving detectors.
