Thought: The researcher wants a single static linear-optical experiment that uses three SPDC pair sources (A–B, B–C, C–D) plus two vacuum inputs to both perform the two Bell measurements at the repeater nodes B and C and simultaneously herald loss-free operation, leaving A and D in a Bell state. Pytheus can implement this by treating the six photons from the pair sources as “num_anc” ancilla photons, specifying the two end modes as undetected outputs (out_nodes) with heralding on all other detector clicks (heralding_out=True), and defining the target_state as the Bell basis on A–D. We'll set num_anc=6 (three pairs), in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,5] (A and D), single_emitters empty, and use loss_func='cr' to maximize the count rate (heralding probability). The config below captures these choices.
