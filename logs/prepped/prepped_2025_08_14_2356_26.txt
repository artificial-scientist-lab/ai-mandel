Thought: The Researcher’s idea of a variational measurement network for three‐tangle estimation isn’t directly compatible with Pytheus’s fixed‐target, static‐circuit paradigm or its built‐in loss functions. We can, however, capture the essence—designing a pure *measurement* network that certifies genuine tripartite entanglement—by asking Pytheus to optimize a static, ancilla‐assisted circuit that maximizes a multipartite‐entanglement loss (loss_func="ent") on two copies of the unknown three‐photon input. This trades out the dynamic VQA loop for an offline training regime: Pytheus will search for a linear‐optical network (with ancillas and number‐resolving detectors) that, when post‐selected on specific click patterns, yields maximal “ent” score—i.e. a strong witness of genuine tripartite entanglement. We leave the classical post‐processing (mapping click frequencies to a three‐tangle estimate) to offline analysis, keeping the Pytheus config strictly static and within its supported capabilities.
