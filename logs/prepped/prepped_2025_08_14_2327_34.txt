Thought: The proposal can be encoded in a single static linear-optical search: two SPDC sources on (A₁–B) and (A₂–C), two vacuum-ancilla amplitude-damping beam splitters from A₁→E₁ and A₂→E₂ with ancilla detectors, a fixed 50:50 BS network routing the “no-jump” mode Aᵣ to the outputs, and post-selection on exactly one ancilla click to herald whether entanglement lands on B or on C. We capture this by treating B, C and Aᵣ as the out_nodes, specifying the two Bell-pair outcomes “110” (Aᵣ–B) and “101” (Aᵣ–C) as the target_state, setting heralding_out=True so only the two ancilla detectors click, and listing those ancilla modes under anc_detectors. Action: accept
