Thought: The researcher’s proposal describes a fully static, passive spatial‐multiplexed entanglement‐swap using k probabilistic pair sources per link, fused by multiport combiner trees and heralded by photon‐number‐resolving detectors, yielding a Bell state on modes 0 and 1. This fits squarely within Pytheus’s capabilities (static linear optics, SPDC sources, no feedback) and is genuinely new. I will accept and produce a corrected Pytheus configuration, replacing the placeholder and invalid keys with the proper keywords, specifying num_anc = 6 for k=3, target_state for the Bell pair, out_nodes = [0,1], heralding_out = true, removed_connections to forbid any direct A–C SPDC link, and standard optimization settings.
