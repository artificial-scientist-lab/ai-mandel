Thought: The proposal relies on embedding non‐commuting Lindblad jump channels and “no‐click” Kraus maps in a teleportation loop—features that lie outside Pytheus’s static, post‐selected linear‐optics framework. Pytheus cannot model dynamic dissipative channels or no‐click operations as programmable elements.
