Thought: The proposal is for a passive, post-selected measurement (Bell-state analyzer) on two photonic ququarts, which in Pytheus is represented as a measurement network: no physical “metasurface” or “photonic crystal” details, just an abstract linear-optical interferometer that discriminates the four 4D Bell basis patterns in the Fock basis. We encode each ququart in four modes (total 8 signal modes), use eight detectors (num_anc=8) to record all modes, and set target_state to the four Fock patterns corresponding to |00〉+|11〉+… in the two-ququart basis. We choose loss_func='fockcr' to maximize count-rate for each basis pattern, set optimizer and thresholds analogously to the GHZ analyzers, and leave out explicit ancilla emitters (measurement only). Action: accept
