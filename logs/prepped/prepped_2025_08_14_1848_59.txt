Thought: The goal is to task Pytheus with designing a heralded, tunable partial‐SWAP gate. Since Pytheus requires a fixed target, I choose θ=π/4 (the “√SWAP” gate) to illustrate the concept. The 4×4 unitary is encoded via six Fock‐basis transitions with polar amplitudes (to capture the needed i phase on the swapped terms). We use two probabilistic ancilla photons (num_anc=2) and heralding_out=true so that only the ancilla clicks post‐select a successful partial‐SWAP. The configuration below specifies the mapping, amplitudes in polar form, and standard optimization parameters.
