Thought: The proposed QND‐difference measurement of an unknown input cannot be encoded directly in Pytheus—since it only “analyzes” known target states or implements fixed transformations. Instead, we can capture the spirit of a non‐destructive, heralded readout by designing a static linear‐optical “identity channel” on two modes that only succeeds (i.e. delivers the inputs unchanged) when two ancilla detectors click. This is fully in Pytheus’s scope: two probabilistic pair sources (num_anc=2), no feed‐forward, number‐resolving detectors herald the success, and the remaining two modes carry the original state intact.
