Thought: The original suggestion described a complex teleportation over an SSH ladder with multiple Bell‐swap modules, but the provided JSON had a non‐existent key (“target_quantum”) and lacked Pytheus‐compatible fields. To stay true to the research question—heraldedly generating a Bell pair between modes 0 and 7 via ancilla‐mediated weak links—we recast it as a post‐selected Bell‐state measurement on modes 0 and 7. We use num_anc=4 ancilla photons (one per weak/rung bond module), forbid unwanted direct SPDC links via removed_connections, and specify a two‐mode Bell target_state ["00","11"] with in_nodes [0,7] (the measured “input” modes). All other keywords follow Pytheus examples.
