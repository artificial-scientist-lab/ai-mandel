Thought: We translate the conceptual “chiral‐edge multi‐hop entanglement swapping” into a static, heralded Pytheus state‐generation problem. We treat two SPDC pair sources (num_pre=2) producing four photons; two are measured in Bell bases at nodes 1 and 3 (ancilla detectors), heralding the remaining two at nodes 0 and 2 into a Bell state |01>+|10>. We enforce the edge‐only connectivity by removing cross‐links [0,2] and [1,3], set heralding_out=true, and optimize for maximum entanglement (loss_func="ent") of the two output modes.
