Thought: The proposed measurement‐based Hadamard via anyon braiding in a toric‐code PEPS network can be abstracted to a static linear‐optical teleportation circuit that implements the logical H gate by successive Bell measurements on a prepared resource “patch.” To remain within Pytheus’s capabilities, we encode the logical map |0⟩→|+⟩, |1⟩→|−⟩ as a discrete‐variable transformation on one input and one output qubit. We use probabilistic pair sources (SPDC) to prepare the underlying resource state implicitly, a single‐photon emitter for the data qubit, and ancilla photons for the Bell‐measurement modules. The target transformation is specified by target_state entries ["00","01","10","11"] with amplitudes [1,1,1,−1], fidelity loss_func, and an appropriate number of ancilla photons for the four Bell measurements around the loop.
