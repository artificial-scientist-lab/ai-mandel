Thought: The researcher’s idea maps to a heralded state‐generation problem: two SPDC sources linked by two Bell measurements each preceded by an abstract d×d DFT. In Pytheus we encode this as a post‐selected experiment with four incoming photons, two measured by ancilla detectors (heralding_out=true), and two left as undetected outputs at nodes A and D. The target is a d‐dimensional Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩+…+|d−1,d−1⟩. We choose d=3 for concreteness. The configuration uses only SPDC sources (no single emitters), passive linear optics, number‐resolving detectors, and Pytheus customizes the internal multiport unitaries (including the implicit DFTs) via numerical optimization.
