Thought: The suggested hybrid DV/CV entanglement swap can be cast purely in Pytheus’s abstract Fock framework by treating both SPDC pair sources (the discrete‐variable Bell source and the two‐mode “Gaussian” EPR source truncated to |00⟩+λ|11⟩) as probabilistic pair sources, post‐selecting on two ancilla clicks at the swap node (so only modes B₁/B₂ are measured) and heralding the remaining modes A and C into the target two‐mode fock‐superposition |00⟩+|11⟩. We set num_anc=2, use fockfid loss, enable heralding_out so that A/C remain undetected and become the output, and leave mode‐labels abstract ([0,1] for A,C). Pytheus then optimizes the beamsplitter ratios and source amplitudes to maximize the heralded fidelity of the hybrid Bell-like state.
