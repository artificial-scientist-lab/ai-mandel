Thought: The researcher’s idea is to use a 3×3 toroidal lattice of Bell‐pair sources and static Bell measurements to postselect runs that realize a noncontractible entanglement‐swap loop, thereby teleporting a qubit between opposite nodes. Pytheus can represent this as a post‐selected transformation mapping no incoming photons to an entangled Bell pair between two output modes (the teleportation endpoints). We encode the target as the two‐qubit Bell state (|00>+|11>), use 18 SPDC sources (each yields two photons consumed by the 18 BSM modules), and 36 ancilla detectors. We set num_anc=36, out_nodes=[0,1], target_state=["00","11"], and use a fidelity loss on postselected “loop” vs. “no‐loop” events. This stays within Pytheus’s static linear‐optics, SPDC+BSM paradigm.
