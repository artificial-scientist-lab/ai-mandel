Thought: The original suggestion uses incorrect keys (‘target_quantum’, a list for `heralding_out`) and conflates indices for in- and out-nodes. I’ll translate it into a valid Pytheus config:  
– Use `target_state` = ["00","11","22"] for the distilled 3D Bell pair.  
– Treat all twelve spatial modes (two 3-mode qutrits on Alice and two on Bob) as incoming: `in_nodes = [0…11]`.  
– We want to herald on the two ancilla detectors only, so set `heralding_out = true` and leave `out_nodes = []`.  
– Specify `num_anc = 2` for the two heralding ancilla photons from SPDC.  
– Fix removed_connections to forbid cross-links as suggested.  
– Remove invalid keys and ensure the optimizer, loss function, thresholds, and other fields follow Pytheus conventions.
