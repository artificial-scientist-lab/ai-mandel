Thought: The dual‐path teleportation protocol can be expressed purely in Pytheus’s language by using four SPDC (pair) sources, forbidding the direct A–C link, heralding the four ancilla photons at the two middle stations B and D, and leaving the output qubit at C undetected (heralding_out=true). Input at A is treated as an incoming node, output at C as an outgoing node. This yields a Bell‐state target between A and C, and by varying source amplitudes Pytheus will mimic J₂/J₁ frustration.
