Thought: The Researcher wants a static, heralded linear‐optical network that realizes a three‐Kraus “EP‐channel” on a single qubit, with an internal tunable phase φ whose spectrum shows an exceptional‐point degeneracy. Pytheus can only optimize for a fixed target transformation or state, so we recast the problem as heralded preparation of the channel’s Choi–Jamiołkowski state for one fixed φ (e.g., φ=π/4). We use dual‐rail encoding (two modes per qubit), inject one input photon plus two ancillas via single‐photon emitters, and herald via number‐resolving detectors on ancilla modes. The remaining two modes carry the Choi state, whose three non‐zero components correspond to the three Kraus operators. We include a tunable internal phase in the graph but fix its value for this design; further φ-scans can be done by re‐optimizing or manually adjusting that phase.
