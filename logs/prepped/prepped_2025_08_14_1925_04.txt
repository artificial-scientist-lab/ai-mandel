Thought: The researcher wants to implement a heralded “bound‐state” router using a C₃‐symmetric tritter to project two Bell‐pair inputs onto a protected dark mode and thereby swap entanglement to remote modes A and D.  We can cast this as a static, ancilla‐heralded state‐generation task: two SPDC Bell‐pair sources feed modes {A,B} and {C,D}, modes B and C enter a tritter whose three output ports are number‐resolving ancilla detectors. When all three ancillas click (the only detected photons), modes A and D remain undetected but are projected into the Bell subspace |00⟩+|11⟩.  This is fully within Pytheus’s static linear‐optics/post‐selection paradigm—no cavities, no feedback—so we set up a state‐generation config with target_state ['00','11'], out_nodes [0,1] (A,D), num_anc=3, heralding_out=True, and number_resolving detectors.
