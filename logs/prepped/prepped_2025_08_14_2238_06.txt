Thought: The colleague’s idea is to fuse teleportation and a discrete Wigner‐parity readout in one static linear‐optical network.  To map it into Pytheus, we encode the unknown qubit in dual‐rail Fock modes 0 and 1, use one SPDC pair (ancilla photons) in modes 3–4 to teleport onto output modes 2–5, then post‐select on two‐click patterns in the ancilla detectors to herald both a successful teleportation and the parity‐measurement at point α.  We declare modes 0–1 as in_nodes, mode 2 as out_node, mark the four detectors as anc_detectors with heralding_out=True, and give the minimal target_state mapping for the two logical rails |0⟩ and |1⟩ to realize both teleportation and parity readout.  This stays within Pytheus’s static, post‐selected, pure‐photon framework without any dynamic feed-forward or undefined physical elements.
