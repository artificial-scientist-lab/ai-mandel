Thought: To capture the photon‐blockade–assisted purification, I treat the two noisy Bell pairs as four incoming photons (from two SPDC sources) in modes 0–3. We perform a parity check by interfering modes 2 and 3 on a 50∶50 beam splitter, then pass those outputs through two single‐emitter “blockade” nodes (modes 4 & 5). Successful one‐click events on both blockade detectors herald that the remaining photons in modes 0 & 1 are projected onto a higher‐fidelity Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩. This is encoded as a transformation with in_nodes [0,1,2,3], out_nodes [0,1], two single_emitters [4,5], anc_detectors [4,5], and target_state = ['00','11'].
