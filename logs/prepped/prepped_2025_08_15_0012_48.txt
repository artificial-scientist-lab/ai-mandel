Thought: The core goal is to build a Pytheus‐compatible, passive, post‐selected network that implements an entanglement witness by (1) approximating the non–completely–positive transpose on qubit B via static beam splitters and ancilla post‐selection, and (2) performing a Bell-state projection on A + (transposed B).  We cannot literally invoke a “PT-symmetric coupler,” but we can mimic its non-unitary action by coupling B to two ancilla vacuum modes (num_anc = 2) through 50:50 beam splitters and post-selecting on “no clicks” at those ancilla detectors.  The surviving mode then interferes with A on a balanced BS whose two output modes ([2,3]) are measured, and a coincident click there heralds |Φ⁺⟩.  All four detectors must click for a successful run, so out_nodes = [2,3] and anc_detectors = [4,5].  We also remove any stray paths via removed_connections.
