Thought: The proposed star‐shaped 4-party GHZ swapping with network steering can indeed be cast as a purely static, heralded state-generation problem in Pytheus. We want four SPDC sources producing 4 remote photons (modes 0–3) and 4 central photons (modes 4–7), then a 4-photon GHZ projection on modes 4–7, leaving modes 0–3 in the GHZ state. We model the SPDC pairs by leaving `single_emitters` empty and specifying `num_anc=4` detectors for the projection. We set `out_nodes=[0,1,2,3]` so these modes survive undetected (`heralding_out=true`), and list the forbidden connections in `removed_connections` so each source only feeds one remote mode and one central mode. The `target_state` is the 4-qubit GHZ superposition on the surviving modes. All other keys follow the standard Pytheus template.
