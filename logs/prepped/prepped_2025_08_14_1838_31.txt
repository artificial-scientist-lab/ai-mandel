Thought: The original suggestion attempted to treat the SSH‐chain physics and a “target_analyzer” field that Pytheus does not support. To stay within Pytheus’s capabilities, I will recast this as a static Bell‐state analyzer: Bell inputs on modes 0 & 3, two ancilla detectors on modes 1 & 2 whose distinct click patterns (“20”, “11”, “02”, “00”) identify the four Bell states. I remove the unsupported physics fields, use a standard loss function (‘cr’), and specify the forbidden links via removed_connections to enforce the SSH‐like topology in the interferometer graph.
