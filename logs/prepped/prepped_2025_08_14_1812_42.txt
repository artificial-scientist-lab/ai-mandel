Thought: The SSH-inspired entanglement-swapping can be cast as a static linear-optical measurement scheme: three SPDC pair sources on “strong” bonds (with weak bonds forbidden by removal_connections), detectors at intermediate nodes 1–4 (heralding), and the remaining modes 0&5 left undetected as the output Bell pair.  We set in_nodes to all six modes, out_nodes to [0,5], heralding_out to true, num_anc=4 detectors, target_state [“00”,”11”], removal_connections listing the forbidden weak bonds plus the defect, and standard optimization parameters.
