Thought: The proposal can be recast as a discrete‐variable qutrit gate/channel in Pytheus by specifying a Choi‐state mapping from one qutrit (in_nodes=[0]) to one qutrit (out_nodes=[1]). We list the nine basis mappings with the appropriate Z₃ phases encoded via imaginary=True. We forbid any direct source–sink SPDC by removed_connections=[[0,1]], use six ancilla detectors for the three Bell‐swap measurements (num_anc=6, heralding_out=True), and recombine the three paths in a 3×3 interferometer. All optional fields not needed are omitted.
