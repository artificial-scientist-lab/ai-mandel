Thought: The original suggestion mixed new physics (non-Hermitian SSH) that Pytheus can’t simulate directly and had several mis-matched keywords (e.g. “target_quantum”), an incomplete list of removed connections, and omitted ancilla designation. I’ve recast it as a purely static post-selected entanglement-swapping protocol on a 6-mode network. Two SPDC pair sources feed modes 0→4 and 2→5; the only allowed couplings are along the 0–4–1 and 2–5–3 edge paths plus the midlink 4–5. We remove all other edges, post-select on two ancilla clicks at [4,5], and herald an unnormalized Bell state ["00","11"] between output modes [1,3]. All keys now match Pytheus’s syntax and capabilities.
