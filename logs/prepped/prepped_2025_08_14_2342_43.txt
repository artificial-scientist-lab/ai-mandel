Thought: We reformulate the “squeezed‐reservoir” ancilla as a third SPDC pair so that Pytheus remains in its discrete, post‐selected linear‐optics domain. Two SPDC sources create the A–B and C–D Bell pairs, and a third SPDC source stands in for the two‐mode squeezed bath. We send modes B, C and the two ancilla modes into the optimized network, herald on four ancilla detectors, and set heralding_out=True so that only A and D remain unmeasured, collapsing onto the target Bell state. We also forbid any direct source‐to‐output shortcuts via removed_connections. This stays fully within Pytheus’s capabilities and captures the idea of reservoir‐assisted entanglement swapping.
