Thought: The researcher’s superactivation idea can be recast as a pure linear-optics, post-selected Bell-state heralding problem: two SPDC sources produce pairs on (0,1) and (2,3), vacuum ancillas model the amplitude-damping environments, and Pytheus optimizes a small interferometer mixing the two environment outputs and detecting them (“heralding”) to unlock a Bell state on modes 0 & 3.  We implement this by setting `num_pre=2` (two SPDC sources), `num_anc=2` (two environment detectors), removing any direct 0–3 path, and asking for a heralded Bell on 0,3 via `heralding_out=true`, `target_state=["1001","0110"]`, optimizing fidelity.
