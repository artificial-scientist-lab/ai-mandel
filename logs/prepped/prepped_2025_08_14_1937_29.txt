Thought: The researcher’s quantum‐router primitive can be expressed as a purely linear‐optical post‐selected transformation: a single-photon qubit in node A is mapped coherently and probabilistically onto two possible output modes (B and C). To force Pytheus to use two SPDC pairs and delay loops rather than a direct beamsplitter, I will (1) block any direct A→B/C connections via `removed_connections`, (2) declare one single‐photon emitter at A, (3) request four ancilla photons from SPDC (`num_anc=4`) (two pairs), (4) herald only the ancilla detectors (`heralding_out=true`), and (5) set the target transformation so that |1⟩_A → (|1⟩_B + |1⟩_C)/√2, encoded by the strings ['110','101'] over [in_nodes=0,out_nodes=2,4] with equal amplitudes.
