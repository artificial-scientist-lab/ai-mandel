Thought: The researcher wants to implement a novel “catalytic” entanglement‐swapping primitive: three SPDC sources producing EPR pairs on modes (A–X), (X'–Y'), (Y–B), and a single 6-mode linear‐optical Bell‐measurement network that simultaneously performs Bell projections on X–Y and X'–Y'. Conditioned on the six detection clicks, one obtains two intact Bell pairs—the new A–B link and the recovered catalyst X'–Y'. This fits Pytheus’s capabilities (probabilistic pair sources, passive interferometer, number‐resolving heralds, no feedback). We represent it as a post‐selected measurement scheme: six incoming photons (in_nodes=0–5), all detected (out_nodes=[]), targeting the three‐EPR‐pair input subspace. The target_state lists the eight basis strings with b0=b1, b2=b3, b4=b5. The detector count num_anc=6. We forbid any direct bypass paths via removed_connections.
