Thought: The global single‐excitation projector can be cast as a post‐selected three‐qubit “gate” in Pytheus: we take the three data qubits as in_nodes, introduce four SPDC ancilla photons, detect only the ancillas (heralding_out=true) and require a four‐click pattern to pass exactly the 0‐ or 1‐excitation data inputs. We encode the mapping in target_state by listing the four allowed three‐bit inputs mapping to their identical three‐bit outputs on separate output nodes. This stays within Pytheus’s discrete‐variable, post‐selection framework with no feedback or hybrid encodings.
