Thought: We recast the Researcher’s nonlocal string‐order measurement as a Pytheus measurement scheme—an “analyzer” in the spirit of the GHZ/W examples—that post‐selects on a single joint click pattern of n herald detectors implementing the Z₁X₂…Xₙ₋₁Zₙ string operator.  This is purely a linear‐optical, static, post‐selected network: no forward‐feed or dynamic control, just SPDC pair sources, beam splitters with fixed phases (to inject X/Z twists), and n number‐resolving herald detectors.  We choose n=5 as a concrete example, yielding a 5-click signature (“11111”) whenever the string‐order expectation is +1.  The input qubits are labeled 0–4 (in_nodes), there are no surviving out_nodes, and num_anc=5 denotes the five herald clicks.  The target_state is the single bitstring “11111”.
