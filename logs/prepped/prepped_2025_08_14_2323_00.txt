Thought: We translate the 4-photon phase-cancelling measurement into a post-selected projection onto the symmetric superposition (|1100>+|0011>)/√2 across the four input modes (0=A, 1=B₁, 2=B₂ with unknown φ, 3=C).  We ask Pytheus to build a static 4-port interferometer (plus vacuum inputs) and four number‐resolving detectors that click exactly when the incoming four‐photon state matches that superposition, thereby teleporting A→C without any φ-dependence.  We set target_state to ['1100','0011'] with equal amplitudes, use a fidelity loss ('fid'), four ancillas, in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], no out_nodes, and number_resolving detectors.
