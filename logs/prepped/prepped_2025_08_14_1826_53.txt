Thought: We will distill the researcher’s three‐party GHZ entanglement‐swapping idea down to the core Pytheus task: design a static linear-optic “GHZ analyzer” acting on three frequency-encoded qubits (six modes). We treat the six local rails as in_nodes; we don’t propagate any outputs (out_nodes=[]), so all six photons are detected (num_anc=6). The target projection is onto the two GHZ basis patterns |f1,f3,f5⟩↔|f2,f4,f6⟩, i.e. “101010” and “010101”. To enforce frequency‐demux, we remove connections mixing the three qubit groups. All detection is done in this analyzer; the remote photons fall into the corresponding GHZ state upon herald. This stays entirely within Pytheus’s capabilities.
