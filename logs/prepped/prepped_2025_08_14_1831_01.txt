Thought: Pytheus works with abstract Fock‐basis patterns and cannot encode toric‐code stabilizers or patch topology directly. To lift the idea of “entangling two logical qubits” into Pytheus, we treat each 2×2 plaquette logical qubit as a 4-photon codeword subspace spanned by the four‐photon patterns {0000,1111,0011,1100}. We then define an 8-mode output register (4 modes for Alice’s logical qubit A, 4 for Diana’s logical qubit D) and specify the 8 target Fock strings comprising the logical Bell state on A&D. The remaining 8 photons act as ancilla heralds (num_anc=8, heralding_out=true). We set out_nodes=[0–7], leave in_nodes empty, use cr loss, number-resolving detectors, and default SPDC ancilla sources. This configuration asks Pytheus to post-select on 8-click ancilla events that project the 8 output photons onto the logical Bell basis without any dynamic feed-forward.
