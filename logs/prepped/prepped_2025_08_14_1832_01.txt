Thought: The proposed teleportation‐router mixes an unknown input qubit, two SPDC Bell pairs, and a single‐photon control qubit in a fixed linear‐optics network with four herald detectors. To make this compatible with Pytheus we assign each physical mode to a node, list all seven incoming photons (one input, four from two Bell‐pair sources, two for the control qubit), specify which nodes remain as outputs (the teleported B/C modes plus the control qubit), mark the other four nodes as ancilla detectors, turn on heralding_out so only the ancilla detectors click, and give two target_fock strings corresponding to the two branches of the superposition. This stays true to the original idea while using only Pytheus‐supported primitives.
