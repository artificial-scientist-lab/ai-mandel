Thought: The researcher’s proposal models two noisy entanglement‐swapping links by using ancilla “noise” photons that are interfered destructively, then heralded to distill a clean Bell pair. To make this Pytheus‐compatible, we should: use two probabilistic photon‐pair sources (each emits one signal and one noise photon), set num_anc=2 (the two noise photons), define the two signal modes as undetected outputs (out_nodes=[0,1]) with heralding_out=true, and target_state=['00','11'] for the Bell pair. We remove any direct source→both‐signal connections. All other optimizer settings follow standard examples.

  "explanation": "Noisy entanglement swapping with coherent noise cancellation: two SPDC sources each emit (Signal,Noise) photons. At Charlie, Signals undergo a Bell‐state projection while the two Noise modes enter a Mach–Zehnder interferometer for destructive interference. Upon two ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true), Alice and Bob share the pure Bell state |00>+|11> despite originating from noisy channels.",
