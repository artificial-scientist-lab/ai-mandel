Thought: Pytheus cannot natively condition on two distinct heralding patterns producing two complementary Bell‐pair configurations in a single run. To stay within its static, heralded‐linear‐optics paradigm, I will instead formulate the first “Floquet step” as a standalone search: a four-mode network that, upon detection in all four output modes, yields Bell pairs on edges A–B and C–D, while forbidding any source from directly linking B–C or D–A. The complementary step can be obtained by swapping the removed_connections and target_state in a second config.
