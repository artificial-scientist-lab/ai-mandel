Thought: The researcher’s proposal is a novel hybrid of dissipative Lindblad‐style coupling and a heralded entanglement swap, but Pytheus cannot ingest continuous‐variable language or explicit “sources” blocks. Instead we encode everything as abstract SPDC‐pair resources (no single emitters), couple modes via implicit beam‐splitters found in the optimization, and then herald only on the ancilla modes. We treat modes 0–1 as the A–B Bell pair, 2–3 as B–C, and 4–5 as the “reservoir” ancilla Bell pair. All six photons are incoming; only A (mode 0) and C (mode 3) remain undetected as out_nodes, while modes 4–5 are the ancilla detectors with heralding_out=True. We ban stray SPDC paths from the system modes 0 & 3 into the ancilla modes via removed_connections. The target_state is the two‐mode Bell subspace ['00','11'] on modes [0,3]. This stays within Pytheus’s discrete optics framework and asks it to find the optimal internal beam‐splitter phases (including the effective η₁, η₂ couplings) that maximize the heralded overlap.
