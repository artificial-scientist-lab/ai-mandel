Thought: The researcher’s “super‐teleportation” uses only static SPDC sources, Bell swaps and a beamsplitter to herald an input qubit onto the even superposition across two remote “corner” modes. To make this Pytheus‐compatible, we must:  
1. Treat it as a state‐preparation: a single photon in mode 0 is probabilistically converted into (|1〉₁+|1〉₃)/√2.  
2. Use in_nodes=[0] and out_nodes=[1,3].  
3. Specify target_state=['010','001'] in the 3‐mode picture (nodes 0,1,3).  
4. Set loss_func='fid', thresholds for fidelity, optimizer and ftol.  
5. Use num_anc=4 for the four ancilla photons (one from each SPDC source).  
6. Set heralding_out=true so only ancillas are detected.  
7. Restrict unwanted SPDC connections via removed_connections.
