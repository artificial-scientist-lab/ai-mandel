Thought: We select Option A—an entanglement‐assisted (3,1) error‐detecting code wrapped around teleportation via two relay nodes—and recast it as a static post‐selected gate in Pytheus.  We treat the logical qubit as a dual‐rail input on modes 0–1 and the teleported output as a dual‐rail output on modes 8–9.  Four SPDC pair sources supply eight ancilla photons (num_anc = 8), and we forbid any direct path from input to output in the removed_connections to ensure the network must use the code + teleportation structure.  The target_state maps the two logical basis states |10⟩₀₋₁→|10⟩₈₋₉ and |01⟩₀₋₁→|01⟩₈₋₉.
