Thought: To implement the researcher’s nonlocal CNOT primitive in Pytheus, I will encode the standard heralded CNOT-on-two-qubits configuration (as in example cnot22_sp) but replace single-photon ancillas with four SPDC‐derived ancilla photons (num_anc=4) to model the two Bell‐pair sources. I will set in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3], target_state for CNOT on qubits, heralding_out=true, no single_emitters, and use number_resolving detectors. This stays within Pytheus’s discrete‐variable, postselected linear‐optics framework and captures the slow‐light/time‐bin delays implicitly via the two‐rail mapping.
