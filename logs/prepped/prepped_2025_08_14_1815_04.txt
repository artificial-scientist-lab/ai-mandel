Thought: The researcher’s primitive is a heralded two‐link repeater node that uses two nonmaximally entangled SPDC sources feeding modes [0,1] and [2,3], mixes the inner photons (1 & 2) in a fixed linear‐optics network, and heralds on two detectors to project the remaining modes [0,3] onto a perfect Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩. This is a state‐generation (not a gate) task with 4 total input photons (from two SPDC pairs) and 2 ancilla clicks. We encode it as a post‐selected state preparation: no single‐photon emitters, two SPDC sources implied, two ancilla detectors (nodes 4 & 5), 'heralding_out'=true so modes 0 and 3 survive unmeasured, 'target_state'=['00','11'], and a removed connection [0,3] to forbid direct SPDC linking. Use 'fid' loss function to maximize Bell fidelity.
