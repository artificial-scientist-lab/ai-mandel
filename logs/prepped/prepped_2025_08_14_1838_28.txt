Thought: The core primitive is a heralded 1→2 asymmetric qubit cloner: one single‐photon emitter provides the unknown qubit, an SPDC pair provides two ancilla photons, and a static beam‐splitter–phase‐shifter interferometer (with reflectivities R1,R2 and phase φ) implements the tunable cloning map. We post‐select on clicks in two ancilla detectors so that the two unmeasured output modes carry the two approximate clones. We must translate this into Pytheus’s abstract discrete‐variable transformation format:  
– in_nodes = [0,1,2] for (unknown emitter at 0, ancilla SPDC photons at 1 & 2).  
– out_nodes = [3,4] for the two clone modes.  
– num_anc = 2 (the two ancilla detectors).  
– heralding_out = True (we detect only the ancilla outputs).  
– single_emitters = [0] (the unknown input).  
– novac = False (we use SPDC ancilla, not vacuum ancilla).  
– target_state: we list the mapping of the three-photon Fock inputs to two-photon Fock outputs when the ancilla clicks succeed. We must include all basis‐state transitions for |0⟩ and |1⟩ inputs:  
   • |100> → |10> (first clone gets the photon)  
   • |100> → |01> (second clone gets the photon)  
   • |010>, |001> handle ancilla vacuum components—these configurations should map to vacuum in the clones for heralding.  
In practice we specify the six relevant input→output Fock strings in a single list.  
All other Pytheus parameters (optimizer, loss_func, thresholds, etc.) are set to standard values.
