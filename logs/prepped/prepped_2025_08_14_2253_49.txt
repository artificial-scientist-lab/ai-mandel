Thought: We can model the “entanglement‐dimension splitting” as a heralded, post‐selected linear‐optics transformation. Start with a single 16‐dimensional Bell pair (nodes 0 & 1), add one ancilla photon (node 4) via a single‐photon emitter, mix them in a fixed metasurface (abstract unitary), and herald on the ancilla click. When the herald succeeds, the two remaining photons (nodes 2 & 3) form two independent 4‐dimensional Bell pairs with the original partners: A–C and B–D. We encode this in Pytheus by treating nodes 0&1 as in_nodes, nodes 2&3 as out_nodes, one single_emitter at 4, heralding_out=true, and target_state listing all 4×4 product‐Bell terms “i i j j” for i,j∈{0..3}.
