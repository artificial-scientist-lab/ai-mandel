Thought: We can cast the “quantum‐metric classifier” as a simple Pytheus gate: take one unknown qubit (in_nodes=[0]) and two ancilla qubits prepared (externally) in reference states |ψ₀⟩,|ψ₁⟩, run two SWAP‐test blocks in parallel, and route the input into one of two output ports (out_nodes=[3,4]) depending on which test has higher overlap.  In Pytheus this becomes a post‐selected transformation on four photons:  one input at node 0, two ancilla photons from SPDC at nodes 1–2 and 3–4, detectors on the two output modes (nodes 5–6) and the two ancilla test modes.  The target_state lists the two orthogonal 6-mode Fock strings where exactly one of the two output ports fires.  Here we demonstrate the D=2, K=2 case, which can be generalized to arbitrary D,K.
