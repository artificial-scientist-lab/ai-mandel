Thought: The researcher’s proposal is a static linear-optical network that fuses two tripartite GHZ₃ resources into a four-party GHZ₄ via a single joint measurement. Pytheus cannot “import” pre-built GHZ inputs, so I encode the six resource photons as incoming nodes, perform a heralded joint measurement on two of them plus two SPDC ancillas, and leave the remaining four modes undetected (heralding_out=True) to realize the GHZ₄. I specify removed_connections to forbid any common source among the four end nodes, set num_anc=4, heralding_out=True, in_nodes/out_nodes accordingly, and include anc_detectors and number_resolving to ensure the correct heralding.
