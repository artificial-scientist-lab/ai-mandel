Thought: The proposed on‐chip, phase-programmable GHZ analyzer is a compelling network application, but Pytheus cannot optimize a parameterized (“reconfigurable”) device in one go. Instead we can target a single static GHZ‐basis projection—say the +GHZ state |000⟩+|111⟩—using three incoming qubit photons and two ancilla single‐photon emitters feeding a 5×5 interferometer. Post‐selecting on all five clicks heralds the GHZ projection. This fully static network sits squarely within Pytheus’s capabilities.
