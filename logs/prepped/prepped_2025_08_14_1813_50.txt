Thought: We need to turn this conceptual 4-body parity measurement into a valid Pytheus measurement configuration. That means specifying the ancilla‐mode input nodes, the two click patterns (“1010” and “0101”) as our target_state, marking the data modes as out_nodes, using heralding_out to only detect ancilla, and removing the single_emitters key (since we’re using implicit SPDC‐style pair sources). We also add missing defaults like num_pre, thresholds, imaginary, safe_hist, and number_resolving for a complete, Pytheus‐ready config.
