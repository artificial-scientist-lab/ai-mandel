Thought: The original suggestion mixed up keywords and included symbolic parameters improperly. I will produce a valid Pytheus configuration that captures the catalytic‐entanglement idea: six input modes (two weak Bell pairs on A,B and C,D plus one squeezed reservoir pair on R1,R2), mixing B–R1 and C–R2, post‐selecting on clicks in modes 1 and 2, and returning modes A,D,R1,R2 as the “catalyst” plus amplified Bell pair. I’ll set in_nodes and out_nodes correctly, specify ancilla detectors, use heralding_out=true, and lay out the four‐term target_state (|00,00⟩,|00,11⟩,|11,00⟩,|11,11⟩). Symbolic amplitudes for the coefficients can be noted but left to the user to substitute numeric values after optimization.
