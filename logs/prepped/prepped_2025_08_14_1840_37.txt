Thought: The Researcher’s goal is to build the SWAP‐test primitive via linear optics—i.e. implement a two‐qubit SWAP gate post‐selectively, so that two copies of an N‐qubit register can be swapped and their parity measured to yield Tr(ρ²). Pytheus does not yet have a SWAP gate example, but it can optimize any discrete‐variable mapping. We therefore encode a post‐selected SWAP(2,2) gate: two incoming qubits (dual‐rail photons) are swapped into two outgoing qubits, conditional on two ancillary SPDC photons.  This static, heralded gate is the building block of the multi‐copy SWAP‐test.
