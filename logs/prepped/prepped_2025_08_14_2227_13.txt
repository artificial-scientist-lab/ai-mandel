Thought: The original suggestion describes a sophisticated programmable 1→3 teleportation supermap controlled by condensate‐tuned beam-splitters, but Pytheus cannot encode external matter controls directly. Instead, we recast it as the static heralded generation of the pure Choi‐state for equal‐weight three-destination teleportation. We remove unsupported keys (beam_splitter_params, removed_connections), pick a fixed equal superposition (α=β=γ), and translate it into a Pytheus‐compatible configuration that post-selects on exactly one Bell‐measurement click among three branches to generate the Choi vector on modes [0(R),1(C),2(D),3(E)]. We use four SPDC sources (num_anc=4), number-resolving detectors, and heralding_out=true so that only the resource modes are kept for the output Choi state.
