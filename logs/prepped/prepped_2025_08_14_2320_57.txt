Thought: The three-body imaginary‐time filter cannot be encoded directly in Pytheus. Instead, I will propose a genuine three‐party GHZ entanglement‐swapping primitive—B holds three Bell‐pair halves, uses two ancilla photons for heralding, and then optimizes a three‐mode GHZ measurement that teleports a GHZ₃ onto the three remote qubits. This stays within Pytheus’s scope (linear optics, SPDC pair sources, post‐selection, number resolving) and captures a novel multi‐node swap.
