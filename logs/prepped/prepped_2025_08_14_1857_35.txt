Thought: We need to turn the teleportation‐based long‐range quantum walk idea into a Pytheus configuration. This is a transformation mapping a single photon in mode 0 to an equal superposition over modes 1,2,3, heralded by Bell measurements on three ancilla photons from SPDC sources. We’ll define one input node [0], three output nodes [1,2,3], and three ancilla photons (num_anc=3). We ban direct SPDC connections from node 0 to the output nodes via removed_connections. The target_state will include the vacuum-to-vacuum mapping and the mapping of |1⟩→|100⟩,|010⟩,|001⟩. We’ll set heralding_out=true so the output photon remains undetected for use in further simulation. The rest of the optimizer parameters mirror typical CR‐based searches.
