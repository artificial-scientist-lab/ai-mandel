Thought: The proposed “one‐shot” syndrome extractor across all four toric‐code stabilizers is too broad for Pytheus’s single‐target framework.  Instead I’ll capture the essence by building a static, post‐selected measurement network that non‐demolition‐measures the Z‐plaquette stabilizer Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ (the 4‐qubit even‐parity subspace) in one shot.  This falls squarely within Pytheus’s measurement archetypes: we take four incoming data photons, post‐select on four detector clicks, and project onto the +1 eigenvalue subspace of Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃.  The same construction can be repeated in the X basis for the X‐stars, giving a modular syndrome‐measurement primitive for the toric code.
