Thought: The researcher’s goal is to design a static, heralded linear-optical network in Pytheus that implements two successive Bell-measurements to fuse three phase-encoded photons into a two-photon entangled state whose relative phase is φ₁+φ₂+φ₃. We capture the essence as a three-node cascaded entanglement-swapping sensor. The Pytheus config treats the unknown plasmonic-cavity phases as abstract static phase shifters on three input modes, consumes them in two Bell measurements (4 ancilla photons), and leaves two output photons in the state |00>+e^{i(φ₁+φ₂+φ₃)}|11>. We forbid any direct source→output paths with removed_connections and set heralding_out=True so the two outputs remain available for interference readout. Action: accept
