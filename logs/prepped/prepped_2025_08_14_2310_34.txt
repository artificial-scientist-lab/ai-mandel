Thought: The Researcher's idea is to implement a heralded noiseless linear amplifier (NLA) on an unknown photonic qubit in the Fock basis, mapping |0⟩→|0⟩ and |1⟩→g|1⟩, using two single‐photon ancillas (from photon‐blockade emitters) for the herald. Pytheus can realize this as a non‐unitary, post‐selected transformation by specifying a one‐mode input/output transform with amplitudes [1,g] and two ancillas from “single_emitters,” heralding on those detectors only. We express the mapping with “target_state” = ["00","11"] and “amplitudes” = [1.0,2.0], set heralding_out=true, include two single_emitters, and optimize with fidelity loss.
