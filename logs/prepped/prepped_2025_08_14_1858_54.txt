Thought: The researcher’s goal is to have Pytheus design a static linear‐optical network that starts from three probabilistic Bell‐pair sources on links AB, BC, CD (six total photons), then performs a single joint GHZ projection on the four “link” photons (B₁, B₂, C₁, C₂) to herald an entangled Bell pair between the two ends A and D in one shot.  Pytheus can treat A and D as the undetected output nodes (heralding_out=true), use num_anc=4 detectors on the measured modes, and specify target_state patterns of length 6 (zeros at A and D positions, and either all zeros or all ones on the middle four modes).  We avoid single‐photon emitters (so the ancilla photons come from SPDC), and we enforce removed_connections so each source only connects to its own pair of modes.  This stays within Pytheus’s purely abstract, discrete‐photon framework and captures the novel GHZ‐measurement percolation primitive.
