Thought: The Researcher wants a static linear‐optics measurement that heralds the three‐qubit “majority‐0” subspace (i.e. ≥2 zeros) on three spin‐photon qubits by post‐selecting on click patterns across five detectors.  Pytheus can treat this as a measurement‐analyzer: we specify the three input modes (in_nodes), the five detectors (num_anc) and list the four 3-bit strings with ≥2 zeros as our target_state.  We leave out explicit ancilla‐source keywords (SPDC or single_emitters) because measurement examples simply treat all detectors via num_anc.  The optimizer then finds a 5-mode interferometer that only clicks for those input strings.  A second analogous config (not shown) would handle “majority‐1.”
