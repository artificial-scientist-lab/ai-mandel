Thought: The proposed four-body π/4‐phase gates cannot be encoded in Pytheus because they produce complex superpositions (mixing or non‐real phases). Instead, I’ll deliver a genuine four‐qubit parity‐phase gadget that is fully diagonal in the computational basis—i.e. U = Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄—which flips the sign of all odd‐parity basis states. This “4-body parity‐phase” gate uses only SPDC ancillas, beam splitters, and photon‐number–resolving detectors, is heralded, requires no feedback, and fits directly into Pytheus’s framework (just like the controlled‐Z examples). Action: accept
