Thought: The researcher wants a quantum‐switch experiment that superposes two entanglement‐swapping orders under a photonic control qubit, distributing entanglement between end nodes A and D.  We can phrase this as a measurement protocol: we send in one control qubit (dual‐rail, modes 0–1), and three Bell‐pair sources connecting rails (A–B, B–C, C–D).  We declare the end nodes A (rails 2–3) and D (rails 8–9) as “in_nodes” whose joint Bell‐state we wish to verify in a superposition correlated with the control.  All other photons are ancillas to be detected.  We then list the four discrete‐variable patterns that correspond to ctrl=|0⟩ or |1⟩ and A–D forming the two‐photon Bell components (|10,10⟩ and |01,01⟩).  This stays within Pytheus’s abstract DV‐photon model (no physical feed‐forward, no hyper‐entanglement).
