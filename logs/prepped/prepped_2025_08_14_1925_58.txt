Thought: The intended cyclic‐swap of three Bell links in a single dissipative heralding step effectively projects the six photons onto the GHZ₆ subspace (|000000⟩+|111111⟩) on the reordered output modes (0→3,2→5,4→1). To make this a valid Pytheus problem, I recast the task as the heralded generation of a six‐photon GHZ state on modes [0,3,2,5,4,1], using three SPDC pair sources and two ancilla detectors. We enforce the dissipative “leak” by blocking direct ancilla→signal paths and post‐select on two clicks. This stays true to the original network‐level primitive while fitting Pytheus’s capabilities.
