Thought: The researcher’s idea is to build a heralded Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate using a “corner mode” qubit as control and two “polaritonic” qubits as targets. Pytheus can represent this as an abstract three‐qubit network transformation: if control=0 do nothing, if control=1 swap the two target qubits. We must list all 8 input→output mappings in `target_state` as six‐bit strings (three input bits followed by three output bits). Use `in_nodes=[0,1,2]` and `out_nodes=[3,4,5]`, four ancilla photons from single‐photon emitters at nodes 3–6, and set `heralding_out=true` so only ancilla clicks are used. Remove any physical language about polaritons or corners—in Pytheus these are just mode labels. The final JSON reflects a new heralded Fredkin primitive.
