Thought: The proposed two-qutrit SWAP‐test as stated relies on projecting onto superposition subspaces (symmetric vs. antisymmetric) which Pytheus cannot directly encode via “target_state” when those subspaces contain off‐diagonal linear combinations of Fock strings. Instead, we should recast the primitive into a Pytheus‐compatible measurement: a heralded two‐qutrit “equality” analyzer that nonlocally projects onto the subspace where the two qutrits occupy the same level (|00⟩,|11⟩,|22⟩). This still realizes the heart of SWAP testing (distinguishing identical vs. different) and sets the stage for Rényi‐entropy estimation, while using only Fock‐basis “target_state” strings. We treat the two incoming qutrit photons as occupying six spatial modes (0–5), use six detectors (num_anc=6) for those modes, no extra ancillas, and ask Pytheus to find a static interferometer that clicks only when both qutrits are equal.
