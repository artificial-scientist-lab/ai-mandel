Thought: The researcher’s purify‐and‐swap protocol can be cast as a heralded state‐generation task: two SPDC sources supply four photons (Charlie's qubits 0–1 and Alice/Bob’s qubits 2–3), Charlie’s fusion measurement is heralded by clicks on detectors 0–1, and Alice/Bob’s output qubits remain as an unmeasured Bell pair on modes 2–3. By setting heralding_out=true, we leave modes 2–3 undetected and optimize for the Bell‐state target_state=[“00”,”11”]. We define in_nodes=[0,1,2,3], out_nodes=[2,3], anc_detectors=[0,1], and remove direct A–B SPDC via removed_connections. The rest follows the Pytheus pattern.
