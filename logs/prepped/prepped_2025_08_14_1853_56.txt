Thought: The SSH‐corner teleportation can be cast as entanglement swapping that post‐selectively creates a Bell pair between corner modes 0 and 3 via two interior Bell measurements. We therefore configure Pytheus to generate the two‐photon Bell state |00>+|11> on output modes [0,3] by using two probabilistic photon‐pair (SPDC) ancilla sources (num_anc=2), performing static Bell measurements on the interior junctions, heralding on those clicks (heralding_out=True), and forbidding any unwanted “diagonal” connections to enforce the 2×2 SSH adjacency via removed_connections.
