Thought: The researcher wants a static linear‐optical measurement network that jointly extracts both the star (X₁X₂X₃X₄) and plaquette (Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄) stabilizers of a minimal toric‐code cell using only two Bell‐pair ancilla sources (four ancilla photons), all in one module and without feed‐forward. We can encode this as a Pytheus measurement problem: four data qubits at in_nodes [0,1,2,3], four ancilla photons (from two pair sources) at nodes [4–7], heralding only on ancilla clicks (heralding_out=true), and no out_nodes. We define a small set of ancilla‐click patterns (four‐bit Fock strings) that correspond to the four possible syndrome outcomes (±1 for star and ±1 for plaquette). We forbid any direct data–data SPDC sources via removed_connections. This skeleton config matches Pytheus’s measurement examples and leaves the actual ancilla–data coupling to the optimizer.
