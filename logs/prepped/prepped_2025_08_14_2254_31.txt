Thought: The researcher’s idea is to perform a single joint linear‐optical measurement that “concentrates” two 3-dimensional Bell pairs into one 2-dimensional Bell pair on the remote modes. In Pytheus terms this is a state‐generation/measurement task: we have two SPDC sources creating qutrit Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), plus two single-photon ancillas on modes (4,5). We mix modes 1,2,4,5 in a passive circuit and herald on number-resolving clicks there, leaving modes 0 and 3 in the qubit Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩. To keep the outputs intact for further use, we set heralding_out=True and declare out_nodes=[0,3]. We specify target_state=['00','11'], two ancillas (num_anc=2), single_emitters at [4,5], and number_resolving detectors. Action: accept
