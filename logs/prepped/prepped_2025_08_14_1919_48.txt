Thought: The researcher’s teleportation‐MZI scheme can be cast as a pure two‐mode linear‐optical unitary (a dual‐rail phase holonomy) achieved by four ancilla Bell swaps and a final beam splitter.  Pytheus cannot handle exotic “loops” or path‐dependent pumping, but it can optimize a static post‐selected network that implements the 2×2 phase gate 
|10⟩→(|10⟩−|01⟩),
|01⟩→(|10⟩+|01⟩)
(up to global normalization).  We encode this as a mapping on 2 input modes to 2 output modes with four ancilla photons (num_anc=4), forbidding any direct input→output shortcuts (removed_connections), and specifying the four “target_state” entries with amplitudes [1,–1,1,1] to realize the π phase jump.  This stays within Pytheus’s abstract photonic gadget framework and captures the quantized holonomy in a single static network.

  We implement a teleportation‐MZI phase holonomy: a dual‐rail qubit on modes 0&1 is post-selected through four ancilla Bell swaps (num_anc=4) and recombined on a balanced beam splitter to enact the 2×2 unitary
    |10> → (|10> − |01>)  
    |01> → (|10> + |01>)
  Forbidding direct 0→2 and 1→3 connections (removed_connections) forces full teleportation around a “corner,” yielding an unambiguous π‐phase jump on one branch.  This static linear-optical configuration (SPDC ancillas + Bell-swap interferometers + beam splitter) realizes the quantized holonomy in one shot and can be generalized to N-gon pumps.
