Thought: The researcher’s programmable Bell‐analyzer proposal overreaches Pytheus’s ability to enact a true conditional Bell measurement, but we can capture the core: a three‐photon network that (1) takes two input modes 0 & 1 (the would‐be Bell pair) and a control photon in mode 2, (2) routes the control unchanged to mode 3, and (3) uses four ancilla photons (from two SPDC pairs) detected at modes 4–7. By setting `heralding_out=true` the control photon is left undetected. We correct the photon counts so that num_anc=4 supplies exactly two SPDC pairs for the ancilla detectors, remove the invalid SPDC→ancilla bans in `removed_connections`, and give a valid “identity‐on‐control” target_State mapping (out = input 2) so Pytheus can at least realize a nontrivial three‐to‐one heralded mapping.
