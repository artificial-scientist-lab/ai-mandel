Thought: The researcher’s multi‐copy SWAP-test can be cast as a pure measurement task in Pytheus: each of the six emitters injects exactly one photon into its own spatial mode (so we use six single_emitters), and we seek an interferometer that, upon number-resolving detection of one photon in each output, only clicks when the two triplets occupy the same one-hot pattern. Thus we specify in_nodes=[0–5], out_nodes empty (measurement scheme), num_anc=6 detectors, and target_state listing the three identical basis strings “100100”, “010010”, “001001”. We leave removed_connections empty (full connectivity) and ask Pytheus to maximize count rate (‘cr’) on those patterns and suppress others.
