Thought: The researcher’s suggestion describes a post-selected, static measurement scheme on four “C-modes” that projects onto joint parity outcomes (Z=0, X=0) to enable simultaneous teleportation along two channels. Pytheus can represent this as a measurement configuration: four incoming photons (the four C-modes), no separate ancilla photons (so num_anc = number of detectors = 4), number‐resolving detectors, and a target_state listing the four‐click output patterns that correspond to the desired parity outcome. We forbid any SPDC path connecting S₁→R₂ and S₂→R₁ via removed_connections. We correct key names (use “target_state”), specify in_nodes, out_nodes empty (measurement), set heralding_out=true, and include number_resolving.
