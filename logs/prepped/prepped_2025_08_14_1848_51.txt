Thought: The researcher wants a static linear‐optical measurement network that, via a VQA loop, learns to distinguish GHZ‐class versus W‐class tripartite qubit inputs. Pytheus can design a measurement analyzer by specifying a target “observable” whose expectation is positive on GHZ inputs and negative on W inputs. We encode that as a linear functional (loss_func='lff') over the clicked Fock patterns: +1 for |000⟩,|111⟩ and –1 for |001⟩,|010⟩,|100⟩. The VQA then tunes beam splitters and phases to minimize this loss (i.e. drive the measurement outcome away from zero), yielding a built‐in classifier: sign(expectation) → GHZ vs W. We set in_nodes=[0,1,2], out_nodes=[], num_anc=3 (three detectors measuring the three photons), number_resolving=True, and let Pytheus optimize the small interferometer.
