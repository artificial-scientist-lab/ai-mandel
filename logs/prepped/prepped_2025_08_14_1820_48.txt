Thought: The researcher’s butterfly network-coding entanglement swap can be cast as a static linear‐optical generation of a four‐mode dual Bell state across modes A–C and B–D. We represent the two target Bell pairs as the superposition |1010>+|0101> (constant total photon number=2), use two single‐photon emitters as ancillas, and let Pytheus optimize the interferometer with post‐selection on the two ancilla clicks. We remove any direct source connections between A↔C and B↔D to enforce network coding.
