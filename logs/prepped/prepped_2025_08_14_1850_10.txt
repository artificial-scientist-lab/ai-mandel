Thought: The proposed nonlocal parity gate between two Z-basis users can be encoded as a 4-photon post-selected transformation in Pytheus.  Alice and Bob’s inputs occupy modes 0 and 1 (single-photon emitters), Charlie’s Bell pair occupies modes 2 and 3 (from a probabilistic pair source, counted in num_anc), and the detection in output modes 2 & 3 carries the XOR result.  We must list the correct 4-digit target_state strings “in01→out23” so that inputs (x,y) map to one-photon clicks in the parity=0 mode or parity=1 mode.  We set single_emitters=[0,1], num_anc=2, in_nodes=[0,1], out_nodes=[2,3], target_state=[“0010”,”0101”,”1001”,”1110”], and use a count-rate loss.  This fits fully within Pytheus’s static, post-selected linear-optics framework.
