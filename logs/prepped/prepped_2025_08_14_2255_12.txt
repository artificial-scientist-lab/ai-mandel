Thought: The core idea is to design a static LOQC network that coherently superposes two distinct heralded functions—entanglement swapping and purification—under a single control photon. Pytheus can handle static interferometers, single‐photon emitters, SPDC ancillas, removed‐connections and post‐selected heralding (heralding_out=True). To cast this into a Pytheus config, we encode the control qubit in two spatial modes (nodes 0–1), the two Bell pairs on modes 2–3 and 4–5 as incoming SPDC inputs, and six ancilla photons (num_anc=6) from default SPDC pair sources. We forbid any unwanted pair‐source connections between the two Bell pairs via removed_connections. We set heralding_out=True so only the six ancillas are detected, leaving the control/output modes intact. The target_state lists the two unnormalized Fock patterns corresponding to (control path=0 + swap on A–D) and (control path=1 + purified Bell on A–B). We leave out out_nodes so that the control and output photons remain undetected for downstream use. Action: accept
