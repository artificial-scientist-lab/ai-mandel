Thought: The proposed “indefinite‐order entanglement purification” really boils down to generating a three‐photon GHZ‐like superposition of the path qubit and the distilled Bell‐pair modes. Pytheus cannot dynamically reconfigure measurement order, but it can statically generate the target state 
(|0⟩_P|00⟩_AD + |1⟩_P|11⟩_AD). 
We encode the path qubit as a single‐photon emitter at node 0, two SPDC pairs feed modes 1–4 (the “noisy” EPR inputs), and the network post‐selects on the four parity clicks so that modes 5–7 (path′, A, D) emerge in the desired GHZ‐form.  
We set in_nodes=[0,1,2,3,4] and out_nodes=[5,6,7], with target_state strings of length 8 mapping input→output.
