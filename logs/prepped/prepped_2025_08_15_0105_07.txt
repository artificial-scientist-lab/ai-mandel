Thought: The researcher’s idea involves a pure LOQC transformation (not a state preparation) mapping a logical qubit in the 3-qubit repetition code (modes 0–2) onto a logical qubit in a minimal 2×2 toric patch (modes 3–6) by teleportation – all in a single static network with four ancilla photons and post-selection. Pytheus’s configuration language expects a list of input/output basis mappings under target_state, so we must encode |000>→|0000> and |111>→|1111> as two 7-digit strings. We declare in_nodes and out_nodes, set num_anc = 4 for the four ancilla photons (from SPDC), enforce no SPDC source crosses between Alice’s and Bob’s modules via removed_connections, and set heralding_out = true so only ancilla clicks are detected. This yields a valid Pytheus config for the intended code conversion primitive.
