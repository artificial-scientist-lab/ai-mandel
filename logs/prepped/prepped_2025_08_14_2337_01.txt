Thought: The researcher wants to multiplex two qubit‐entanglement swaps (even‐/odd‐OAM subspaces) in one ancilla‐assisted linear‐optics network, yielding two Bell pairs across A–D and B–C. Abstracting away the OAM preprocessing, this is simply heralded generation of the 4-photon state |00⟩ₐ_d⊗|00⟩_b_c + |01⟩ₐ_d⊗|01⟩_b_c + |10⟩ₐ_d⊗|10⟩_b_c + |11⟩ₐ_d⊗|11⟩_b_c, i.e. target_state = ["0000","0110","1001","1111"]. We need four input photons (two Bell‐pair SPDC sources) on nodes [0,1,2,3], two ancilla photons for the two simultaneous parity‐Bell measurements (num_anc = 2), herald only on the ancilla detectors (heralding_out = True), forbid any direct SPDC connections that would create unwanted links (removed_connections), and let Pytheus optimize the single static interferometer.
