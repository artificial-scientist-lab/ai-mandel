Thought: The proposed three-qubit GHZ-basis analyzer via on-chip HOM modules simplifies to a GHZ+ measurement supermap in Pytheus. We must stick to Pytheus’s measurement‐analyzer format—targeting the |000⟩+|111⟩ projector—and encode the three Bell‐pair sources as probabilistic pair sources (num_pre), specify nine detection modes (num_anc), list incoming nodes, and include the relative amplitudes. We leave connectivity to the optimizer and keep optional keys minimal.
