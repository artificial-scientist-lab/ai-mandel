Thought: The proposed “entanglement router” requires choosing a single branch‐conditioned routing outcome for Pytheus to optimize. I will target the case where herald clicks in branch 1 (on the battery-powered amplitude-damping module applied to the first Bell pair) swap entanglement onto the remaining two remote modes (C–D, i.e. modes 3 and 5). I’ll define SPDC pairs as incoming modes [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], use mode 6 as the single‐photon emitter, and modes 7–12 for the six herald detectors. I set in_nodes=[0,2,4], out_nodes=[3,5], heralding_out=true so that only herald detectors click and the remote pair remains intact, and target_state for a Bell state between modes 3–5 as ["01","10"]. I’ll include removed_connections to forbid the battery from feeding remote modes and the vacua from leaking into the wrong branches.
