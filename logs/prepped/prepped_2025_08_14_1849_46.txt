Thought: The key idea is a static, three‐node ring of Bell‐pair links implementing two teleportation routes from A→C that interfere via a tunable phase φ on one edge, yielding directional (chiral) routing to either B or C. To express this in Pytheus, we 1) inject a qubit at A with a single‐photon emitter, 2) create three probabilistic Bell‐pairs on edges AB, BC, and CA (total of six ancilla photons, num_anc=6), 3) designate the single emitter at node 0 and the three pair‐sources at nodes 1–6, 4) define out_nodes at B (node 4) and C (node 5), 5) list target_state strings that map the input‐emitter photon from A into either the B or C output slots under heralding of all six ancilla clicks, and 6) allow the optimizer to find the correct static beam-splitter phases (including φ) by setting imaginary=True. This stays within pure static LO + post-selection, uses only Pytheus’s built-in SPDC pairs and single emitters, and captures the chiral teleportation router concept.
