Thought: The Researcher’s goal is a passive, feed-forward-free teleportation that fuses cluster-state MBQC with a measurement-controlled phase gate.  Pytheus can only optimize a fixed, heralded linear-optical transformation (i.e. a post-selected gate) on dual-rail qubits.  I will recast their “cycle‐graph teleportation with passive by‐product cancellation” as a heralded R_Z(φ) gate on a dual-rail photonic qubit.  We encode the input qubit on modes [0,1], the output on [2,3], and use two single-photon ancilla sources at modes [4,5] to realize the cluster-graph resource.  We fix φ (e.g. π/2) so the phase is numeric, and specify the target_state mapping with amplitudes [1, e^{iφ}].  This stays true to the original idea of measurement-controlled phase, but is a concrete Pytheus task.
