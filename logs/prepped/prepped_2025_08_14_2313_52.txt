Thought: The proposed 2×2 “percolation” SQKD network can be cast as a static, heralded entanglement‐generation protocol over the diagonal A–C of a square graph. Four probabilistic pair sources on edges AB, BC, CD, DA feed eight input modes (0–7). Two Bell analyzers at B (modes 1&2) and D (modes 5&6) use ancilla detectors (8–11) to herald successful swaps on both disjoint paths. When both heralds click, the remaining two photons at nodes A (mode 0) and C (mode 4) emerge in a Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩. We set out_nodes=[0,4] and heralding_out=true so that only the two ancilla clicks are required to herald the entangled resource, leaving A and C photons “alive” for key‐generation.
