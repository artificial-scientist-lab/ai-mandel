Thought: The researcher wants to implement a remote CNOT via teleportation and boost the Bell‐measurement with a PT‐symmetric filter.  Pytheus can’t encode PT physics directly, but it can realize any non‐unitary two‐qubit mapping by introducing ancilla SPDC pairs and post‐selection.  We recast the idea as a four‐ancilla, eight‐mode post‐selected CNOT gate: two SPDC pair sources for teleportation plus two more to implement the non‐unitary filter, with only beam splitters and number‐resolving detectors.  We set up the CNOT truth table as the target_state, mark the two input qubit modes (A and C), the two output qubit modes, forbid direct SPDC cross‐talk with removed_connections, and herald only on the four ancilla clicks (teleportation and filter).  This stays within Pytheus’s discrete‐photon, static, post‐selected framework.
