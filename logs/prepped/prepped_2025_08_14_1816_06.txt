Thought: The researcher’s proposal calls for a static, heralded measurement of the three‐state Bargmann invariant via a cyclic superposition of three Bell-swap orders. To match Pytheus’s syntax, I need to turn the idea into a proper configuration file: use “target_state” (not “target_quantum”), specify the ancilla count and incoming modes, and list the forbidden direct connections. Since the actual 10-mode click patterns for the “+” and “–” projectors must be determined offline, I’ll leave target_state as an empty placeholder to be filled with those symmetric and antisymmetric patterns later.
