Thought: The cyclic‐SWAP unitary on three qubits can be encoded directly in Pytheus as a heralded transformation by treating the three input single photons as “in_nodes,” using six ancilla photons from SPDC pair sources, and heralding on ancilla detectors (heralding_out=True) so the three teleported outputs emerge in the cyclic order. We list all eight basis mappings in target_state, forbid any direct SPDC between input modes via removed_connections, and leave the outputs undetected. This stays within Pytheus’s abstract framework—no feedback or hybrid encodings.
