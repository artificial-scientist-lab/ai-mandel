Thought: We must translate the researcher’s telecloning‐network idea into a valid Pytheus configuration. Pytheus only knows about abstract modes, in_nodes/out_nodes, target_state ± amplitudes, ancilla photons (num_anc), post‐selection (heralding_out), and optimization parameters. We’ll assign the dual‐rail input qubit on modes [0,1], the two dual‐rail clones on modes [2,3] and [4,5], use four ancilla photons (two Bell‐pair sources → num_anc=4), and herald on clicks in those ancilla modes. We’ll express the ideal 1→2 telecloning mapping for the computational basis |0⟩→|00⟩ and |1⟩→|11⟩ as target_state entries in the six‐mode space, and optimize fidelity (‘fid’) to that mapping under a minimum success threshold. All custom fields (beamsplitters, loss elements, coupling parameters) are absorbed into the overall unitary that Pytheus will search for via its generic edges optimization.
