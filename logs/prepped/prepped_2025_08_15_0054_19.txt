Thought: The proposed experiment is essentially a four-photon measurement scheme mixing two “time‐bins” as abstract modes. We can encode time‐bins m=0,1 as separate spatial modes (labels 1 and 2), use two SPDC pair‐sources feeding modes 0↔1 and 2↔3, and design a static four-mode interferometer at B to mix modes 1 and 2. The measurement scheme accepts exactly one photon in each input mode (A0,B0,B1,C1), so we specify target_state [“1111”], in_nodes [0,1,2,3], no out_nodes, and num_anc=4 detectors. We remove exotic features and allow Pytheus to optimize a 4-mode interferometer with 4 detectors.
