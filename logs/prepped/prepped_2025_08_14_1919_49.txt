Thought: The researcher wants a heralded 1→2 qutrit telecloner: an abstract linear-optical transformation that takes one unknown qutrit at input node 0 and produces two output qutrit clones at nodes 1 and 2, heralded by three ancilla detections. Pytheus can implement this as a post-selected transformation: basis states |0⟩,|1⟩,|2⟩ at node 0 map exactly to |00⟩,|11⟩,|22⟩ at nodes 1,2. Three ancilla photons (from SPDC pair sources) occupy modes 3–5; heralding_out=true means only the ancillas are detected (anc_detectors=[3,4,5]), leaving the two teleclones intact. We specify target_state=["000","111","222"], in_nodes=[0], out_nodes=[1,2], and use number-resolving detectors with a count-rate loss function. This stays within Pytheus’s capabilities (static interferometer, post-selection, abstract qutrit mapping) and captures the core telecloning transformation.
