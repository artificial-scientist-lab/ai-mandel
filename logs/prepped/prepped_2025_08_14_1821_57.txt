Thought: The researcher’s goal is to build a ring‐swapped 3-node interferometer using only SPDC (two-mode squeezed vacua), linear optics, Bell swaps, and photon-number–resolving detectors, so that post-selecting on the three central swap clicks leaves a three-mode W-type resource whose final multiport detection statistics carry all three relative phase differences.  Pytheus cannot optimize a continuous phase‐estimation protocol directly, but it can design the static entanglement-swap + W-state measurement network: three probabilistic pair sources feeding ancilla detectors (the three swap outcomes) plus a 3×3 multiport whose output detectors fire in patterns corresponding to a W state.  We recast the objective into a post-selected W-state measurement: only the three detection patterns “100111”,“010111”,“001111” (output in one of A,B,C and ancilla all click) are kept.  We use the ‘lff’ (loss-function-fringe) target to shape the coincidence rates into interference fringes, set num_anc=3, anc_detectors=[3,4,5], in_nodes=[], out_nodes=[0,1,2], number_resolving=True.  This stays strictly within Pytheus’s capabilities.
