Thought: The researcher’s idea—to herald a non‐Markovian amplitude‐damping channel by entangling the two environment ancillas in a Bell measurement—is novel, but Pytheus cannot accept custom “amplitude_damping” or “analyzer” keys. Instead, we recast the channel as a post‐selected dual‐rail qubit gate: we encode the qubit in two single‐photon emitters, couple it twice to vacuum ancillas via beamsplitters (to simulate damping), then Bell‐analyze those ancillas with a static 50:50 BS + phase and two PNR detectors. We require a particular two‐click pattern on the Bell analyzers to herald the identity mapping on the dual‐rail qubit.  The ancilla photons appear at the unused ports and are detected (‘anc_detectors’), and we signal success by ‘heralding_out’.  This pure‐state transformation preserves |00⟩ and |11⟩ on in→out rails, giving the identity map conditioned on the Bell‐click outcome.  Pytheus will optimize the internal beam splitter transmissivities (η₁,η₂) and the BS phase to maximize the count‐rate fidelity of that mapping.
