Thought: The researcher’s proposal aims to probe the non-commutativity of two Markovian maps (amplitude vs phase damping) by applying them in alternate orders on half of two Bell pairs and then swapping entanglement to compare outcomes. Pytheus cannot directly take “Lindblad channels” as inputs, but it can optimize the static linear-optic subcircuits that implement these Kraus maps via beam splitters and ancilla heralds. We must:  
1) Drop the invalid keyword `probabilistic_pair_sources`, treating both Bell pairs as incoming modes (`in_nodes`).  
2) Encode the four environment-mode detectors as `num_anc = 4` with their indices in `anc_detectors`.  
3) Restrict unwanted SPDC cross-connections with `removed_connections`.  
4) Set `target_state` = [“00”, “11”] on the swapped output qubits (`out_nodes`).  
5) Use `heralding_out=false` so that both the ancilla and Bell-measurement detectors must click.
