Thought: To translate the Entanglement-Fano interferometer into a Pytheus configuration, we model A and C as two output modes and use three ancilla heralds (one for each swap station B, D, E), so num_anc=3 and heralding_out=true. We set imaginary=true to allow internal phase degrees of freedom φ₂ and φ₃ on the 2-hop and 3-hop swap loops. We target the two-photon Bell subspace |00>+|11> on modes [0,1], with removed_connections preventing unintended source–detector links. Standard optimization settings are used to drive the count-rate fidelity loss function below threshold.
