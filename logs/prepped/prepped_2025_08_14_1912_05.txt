Thought: The logical-Bell analyzer is a measurement primitive, so we treat the six input modes as in_nodes, no outputs, and specify the four codeword patterns that correspond to the four logical Bell states. Eight ancilla detectors herald the joint parity checks. We block undesired common-SPDC connections via removed_connections, set num_anc = 8, enable number-resolving detection, and use a loss‐rate criterion (cr).
