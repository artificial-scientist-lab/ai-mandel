Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine “nonlocal quantum correlation” and “quantum protocol” in a network setting without merely generating a target state:
    a) Quantum network coding: implement the 2‐sender/2‐receiver butterfly network via teleportation and entanglement swapping to send two qubits through a single bottleneck.
    b) Multiplexed teleportation: teleport two qubits from two senders to two receivers using one fewer pair source via a shared repeater node, demonstrating resource compression.
    c) Post‐selected linear‐optical Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate used as a quantum routing primitive in a small network, realizing coherent path control without feedback.
  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus obstacles:
    a) Butterfly network coding has not been done by Pytheus (they have only pure ES or state analyzers). It’s conceptually novel. Pytheus can design Bell measurements and pair‐source networks, so this is feasible.  
    b) Multiplexed teleportation is similar to (a) but simpler; still novel, but less rich than network coding.
    c) Fredkin is a three‐qubit gate like Toffoli; Pytheus could probably do it, but it’s less of a “network protocol” than a single gate.
  Step 3: Pick the most promising: (a) the butterfly‐topology teleportation/network‐coding protocol.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment realizes simultaneous two‐way teleportation through a network bottleneck in a butterfly geometry, nor does any example implement quantum network coding.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework: it uses only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, post‐selected Bell measurements and ancilla heralding. It does not require feedback, cavities, or hyper‐entanglement, and directly leverages nonlocal correlations (entanglement swapping + teleportation) in a quantum protocol (network coding).

Action: final answer
Action Input: 
Description:
Implement the simplest quantum network coding (butterfly) protocol in a post‐selected linear‐optical experiment. Two senders S1 and S2 wish to teleport qubits |ψ₁⟩,|ψ₂⟩ to two receivers R1 and R2 across a shared bottleneck. We arrange four probabilistic photon‐pair sources and four Bell analyzers in the “butterfly” geometry:

Structure:
  Sources:
    E₁ between S1 and central node C
    E₂ between S2 and central node C
    E₃ between C and R1
    E₄ between C and R2
  Nodes & Measurements:
    – Senders S1 (node 0) & S2 (node 1) each hold an unknown qubit |ψ⟩ plus one photon from E₁/E₂. They perform local Bell measurements BM₁ on (|ψ₁⟩,E₁) and BM₂ on (|ψ₂⟩,E₂).
    – After BM₁,₂ we have the two teleported qubit modes arriving at C (nodes 2 and 3).
    – At C we perform one two‐photon Bell measurement BM₃ on nodes 2 & 3, entanglement‐swapping them into a single heralded correlation.
    – C then redistributes the two teleported states through E₃ & E₄ and performs two local Bell measurements BM₄ (optional if needed by network coding design) or directly routes the states out to R1 (node 4) and R2 (node 5).
  Ancilla detectors (nodes 6 & 7) herald the successful coincidence pattern from BM₁–BM₃. Conditioned on these clicks, the final two output modes at R1 and R2 contain |ψ₁⟩ and |ψ₂⟩ respectively.

Target Quantum:
  We fix the senders’ inputs to the computational basis { |00>,|01>,|10>,|11> } so that post‐selected on the ancilla pattern, detections in output modes {4,5} reproduce exactly the same two‐bit basis string.  
  target_quantum = ['0000','0101','1010','1111']

Why it’s Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First demonstration of quantum network coding (butterfly topology) in linear optics.
  – Explores fundamental limits of nonlocal correlations in network protocols.
  – Directly generalizes to N×N network coding and entanglement‐assisted routing in larger topologies.
  – Bridges entanglement swapping and teleportation with a bona‐fide quantum communications protocol.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This butterfly network‐coding teleportation scheme is essentially the same “butterfly” entanglement‐swapping/dual‐Bell‐pair distribution protocol already proposed in the ensemble (“Butterfly Network‐Coded Four‐Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell‐Pair Distribution”). It offers no new mechanism beyond post‐selected teleportation over a bottleneck that’s been described. To be novel it would need a genuinely different routing or coding primitive not covered by that four‐photon joint‐measurement butterfly network.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core “butterfly” topology and measurement‐based dual teleportation has been detailed already (see the ensemble’s “Butterfly Network‐Coded Four‐Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell‐Pair Distribution”). To be considered novel, you must propose a distinct network‐coding primitive or measurement pattern that goes beyond that existing four‐photon entanglement‐swap design.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine “nonlocal quantum correlation” and “quantum protocol” in a network setting without merely generating a target quantum:
    a) Linear‐optical butterfly network coding: simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a shared bottleneck, demonstrating quantum network coding with entanglement swapping and post‐selected Bell measurements.
    b) Multipartite conference teleportation: one sender teleports a single unknown qubit to two receivers in a star network via GHZ‐like entanglement swapping, verifying nonlocal correlations in a teleportation‐based multiparty protocol.
    c) Controlled‐router node: a post‐selected optical Fredkin‐gate acts as a quantum router that coherently switches two entangled photon streams, enabling a simple two‐node quantum switching protocol.
  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus obstacles:
    a) Butterfly coding has no analogue in the existing list; uses only probabilistic pair‐sources and Bell analyzers—fits Pytheus.  
    b) GHZ‐based conference teleportation is similar to existing multipartite ES but focuses on protocol rather than state generation; could overlap with GHZ setups and isn’t as clearly novel.  
    c) Fredkin‐router is a single‐gate demonstration, not a full network protocol—less compelling as a “quantum protocol” beyond gate implementation.
  Step 3: Pick the most promising: (a) the butterfly‐topology network coding protocol.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus experiment realizes a true quantum network coding primitive in linear optics. It goes beyond pair‐wise entanglement swapping or pure teleportation by interleaving two teleportations through a single repeater in a butterfly geometry.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because it uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, standard post‐selected Bell measurements, and ancilla heralding. It requires no feedback control, no hyper‐ or hybrid‐entanglement, and focuses on a quantum protocol (network coding) built from nonlocal correlations.

Description:
  Quantum butterfly network coding: simultaneous two‐way teleportation of two unknown qubits through a single bottleneck in a linear‐optical network.  
  Two senders S1,S2 wish to send qubits |ψ₁⟩,|ψ₂⟩ to two receivers R1,R2 over a shared repeater node C, using only four probabilistic photon‐pair sources and post‐selected Bell measurements.

    E3 connects C (node 2') ↔ R1 (node 4)  
    E4 connects C (node 3') ↔ R2 (node 5)  
  Measurements:
    – BM₁ at S1: Bell measurement between |ψ₁⟩ (external) and E1 output at node 0  
    – BM₂ at S2: Bell measurement between |ψ₂⟩ (external) and E2 output at node 1  
    – BM₃ at C: Bell measurement between E1’s second photon (node 2) and E2’s second photon (node 3), effecting entanglement swapping  
  Outputs:
    – Remaining photons from E3, E4 travel to R1 (node 4) and R2 (node 5) and carry the teleported qubits.  
  Ancilla Heralding:
    – Two ancillary detectors (nodes 6,7) record specific coincidence patterns from BM₁,₂,₃. Conditioned on these clicks, the outputs at R1,R2 faithfully reproduce the inputs.

Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First linear‐optical demonstration of quantum network coding in a butterfly topology.  
  – Explores resource compression: only four pair sources and three Bell measurements instead of two independent teleportations.  
  – Bridges nonlocal correlations (entanglement swapping) and a bona-fide network protocol (simultaneous two‐way teleportation).  
  – Generalizes to larger network coding protocols (N×N grids, repeater chains) and fosters new study of measurement‐based quantum routing without feedback.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed linear‐optical butterfly network coding is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Butterfly Network‐Coded Four‐Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell‐Pair Distribution,” using the same four SPDC sources, three Bell swaps, and post-selection to route two qubits across a central bottleneck. No new measurement primitive or coding advantage beyond that known four-photon joint‐measurement design is introduced.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme duplicates the ensemble’s existing butterfly network coding protocol. To be novel, you must propose a fundamentally different network‐coding primitive or entanglement‐swapping measurement that goes beyond the four‐photon butterfly joint measurement already described.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three network‐protocol ideas combining nonlocal quantum correlations and quantum protocols without focusing on pure state generation:
    a) Quantum network coding in a butterfly topology (two simultaneous teleportations through a shared repeater).  
    b) Conference key agreement via entanglement swapping in a square lattice percolation network.  
    c) Controlled‐routing primitive (Fredkin‐gate router) for conditional entanglement distribution.
  Step 2: Check novelty vs past Pytheus experiments and feasibility:
    a) Butterfly coding has been explored by others (not novel enough).  
    b) Square‐lattice percolation is novel (no 2D swapping network yet) and uses only pair sources plus static Bell measurements—within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
    c) Fredkin‐router is essentially a multi‐qubit gate, not a full protocol—less compelling.
  Step 3: Choose (b) 2×2 entanglement percolation network for conference key agreement.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment explores entanglement percolation across a 2D network of four nodes using two swapping stations to establish nonlocal correlation between distant corners.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus since it uses only four probabilistic photon‐pair sources, two post‐selected Bell analyzers, linear optics, and ancilla heralding—no feedback, cavities, or state‐generation requirements.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
  Demonstrate entanglement percolation and a simple conference key‐agreement protocol on a 2×2 square network of four nodes (A, B, C, D). Two diagonal nodes (A,C) or (B,D) wish to share a secure key via entanglement swapping at the two intermediate nodes (B and D).

Structure (nodes 0–7):
  Pair sources:
    S_AB between A (0) ↔ B (2)
    S_BC between B (3) ↔ C (4)
    S_CD between C (5) ↔ D (7)
    S_DA between D (6) ↔ A (1)
  Swapping measurements:
    – BM_B at B: Bell measurement on photons at nodes 2 & 3  
    – BM_D at D: Bell measurement on photons at nodes 6 & 7  
  Outputs:
    – After successful BM_B and BM_D heralded by ancilla detectors (nodes 8 & 9), one diagonal pair emerges:
       • If both swaps succeed, A (node 0 & 1) and C (nodes 4 & 5) share a Bell‐like correlation.  
       • Alternatively, a different pattern yields B‐D correlation.
  Conference Key Protocol:
    – A and C measure their heralded photons in randomly chosen bases (Z or X) to generate correlated key bits.  
    – Public discussion of measurement bases yields sifted key with entanglement‐based security.

Target Quantum Correlations:
  Verify that, conditioned on the two‐click heralding pattern, measurement outcomes at A and C are perfectly correlated in the Z basis:

Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First linear‐optical realization of entanglement percolation on a 2D square network.  
  – Combines nonlocal correlations (dual entanglement swapping) with a genuine quantum protocol (conference key agreement).  
  – Demonstrates network robustness: keys can be shared between either diagonal pair depending on which swaps succeed.  
  – Generalizes to larger lattice networks for percolation thresholds and multiuser quantum‐secure communication.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal of entanglement percolation on a 2×2 square with dual Bell‐swaps and a conference‐key protocol is essentially the same as the ensemble’s “2×2 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution.” It uses four edge sources, two diagonal Bell measurements, and key extraction from correlated basis measurements—no new network‐coding or measurement primitive is introduced.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates the ensemble’s 2×2 percolation and key‐distribution protocol. To be novel, you must propose a fundamentally different measurement topology, resource arrangement, or key‐agreement primitive that goes beyond the existing semi-quantum key distribution percolation design.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to meaningfully combine “nonlocal quantum correlation” and “quantum protocol” in a Pytheus‐compatible network (no pure state generation):
    a) Quantum butterfly network coding (simultaneous two‐way teleportation through a shared repeater) – but close to known designs.  
    b) 2×2 entanglement percolation + conference key agreement on a square lattice – useful but echoes existing percolation QKD setups.  
    c) Quantum switch of entanglement swapping order – a genuinely new network‐protocol primitive where the order in which two swapping operations occurs is placed in quantum superposition under control of an ancilla qubit.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    a) Already touched on by other groups; not novel enough.  
    b) Similar percolation/QKD experiments exist in Pytheus history.  
    c) No existing Pytheus experiment realizes a quantum switch of two entanglement‐swapping channels. It uses only pair-sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter, post-selected linear optics, and no feedback.  
  Step 3: Pick (c).  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus setup superposes two different entanglement-swapping routines under the coherent control of an ancilla qubit—the “quantum switch” paradigm applied to entanglement distribution.  
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because it requires only: 
    • Three probabilistic photon‐pair sources, 
    • One single‐photon ancilla source (the control qubit), 
    • Three Bell measurements (two for swapping, one to entangle control with path), 
    • Linear optics, static arrangement, and post-selection (heralding).  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
  Quantum-switch of entanglement- swapping: coherently control, with one ancilla qubit, whether Alice’s photon is first swapped with Bob’s or Charlie’s, generating a superposition of two network routes.  
  This realizes the quantum-protocol primitive known as the “quantum switch” in a purely linear-optical entanglement network, combining nonlocal correlations (entanglement swapping) with a genuine network protocol (superposition of channel order).

General Structure (nodes 0–5):
  Sources:
    • Pair S_AB between Alice (node 1) ↔ Swap-station X (node 2)  
    • Pair S_XC between X (node 3) ↔ Charlie (node 4)  
    • Pair S_BD between Bob (node 5) ↔ Swap-station Y (node 6)  
  Control:
    • Single-photon ancilla emitter at node 0 prepares |0⟩_c+|1⟩_c  
  Measurements:
    • BM_control: joint linear-optical “routing” measurement entangles the ancilla (node 0) with which swap station (X or Y) is activated  
    • BM_swapX: Bell measurement at X on modes 2 & 3 (Alice–Charlie swap)  
    • BM_swapY: Bell measurement at Y on modes 5 & 6 (Bob–? swap – tailored so that Bob’s leg can only swap with Charlie when the ancilla routes there)  
  Heralding:
    • Two ancilla detectors record the desired coincidence pattern from BM_control+BM_swapX/BM_swapY. Conditioned on these clicks, the final 2-photon state at Alice & Charlie (nodes 1 & 4) is either the result of swapX (if control=|0⟩) or swapY (if control=|1⟩), coherently superposed.

Target Quantum (abstract 5-qubit state):
  |Ψ⟩ = |0⟩_c⊗(|Φ⁺⟩_{A–C}) + |1⟩_c⊗(|Φ⁺⟩_{B–D})  
  where |Φ⁺⟩ = |00⟩+|11⟩ for the appropriate node pairs, and the ancilla qubit |0⟩,|1⟩ controls the swapping order.

Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable:
  • First linear-optical realization of the quantum switch for entanglement distribution – coherently superposes two network routes.  
  • Merges nonlocal quantum correlation (two different entanglement-swapping channels) with a true quantum protocol primitive (superposition of channel order).  
  • Opens the door to higher-order superpositions of multiple repeater-chain orders, passive quantum routing, and entanglement-based quantum communication networks without feedback.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to coherently superpose two entanglement‐swapping orders via an ancilla control photon is precisely the “entanglement‐switch quantum switch” already in the ensemble (“Implementing an Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic‐Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders”). It offers no new measurement primitive or network coding beyond that existing scheme.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is effectively identical to the ensemble’s “Implementing an Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic‐Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders.” To be novel, you must propose a fundamentally different superposition of channel order or a new routing primitive not already captured by that quantum‐switch design.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry nonlocal quantum correlation and a genuine quantum protocol in a static linear-optical network (no pure state generation):
    a) Quantum butterfly network coding (two simultaneous teleportations through one repeater) – too close to existing entanglement-swap examples.
    b) 2×2 entanglement-percolation conference QKD – overlaps percolation/QKD designs.
    c) Superposition of “teleportation vs direct transmission” as a communication primitive: coherently route an unknown qubit either through a Bell-swap teleportation channel or via a direct (“identity”) channel under the control of a photonic ancilla, and verify interference at the receiver.
  Step 2: Evaluate novelty & feasibility:
    a) Already explored in other groups’ “butterfly” experiments.
    b) Existing 2D percolation/key-distribution setups in Pytheus.
    c) No prior Pytheus experiment superposes two different communication protocols (teleportation vs identity) under a single-photon control. It combines nonlocal correlation (entanglement swapping/teleportation) with a higher-level protocol primitive (indefinite‐channel superposition). Feasible with probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon ancilla, static beam splitters, a post-selected Bell analyzer and a heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate—all within Pytheus’s capabilities.
  Step 3: Choose (c).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no linear-optical experiment to date (and no Pytheus design) implements a superposition of two distinct quantum communication channels—teleportation vs direct transmission—controlled by a quantum ancilla, with nonlocal correlation verified by interference.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework:  
    • One single-photon emitter for the control qubit, one single-photon emitter for the unknown input, three probabilistic pair-sources for the teleportation channel,  
    • Static linear optics implementing a heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP), a standard Bell measurement (entanglement swapping), plus beam splitters to recombine the two channel outputs,  
    • Ancilla heralding detectors to post-select success. No feedback, hyper-entanglement, cavities, or memories required.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
  Superposition of teleportation vs direct transmission—“quantum‐protocol in a superposed channel.”  
  We coherently route an unknown photonic qubit |ψ⟩ either through a standard teleportation network (nonlocal correlation via Bell-swap) or through an identity channel, under the control of a single‐photon ancilla qubit, and observe interference at the receiver. This demonstrates an “indefinite‐channel” communication primitive built from entanglement swapping and post-selected controlled-SWAP, merging nonlocal quantum correlations with a higher‐order quantum protocol.

Network Structure (abstract nodes 0–7):
  Single-photon emitters:
    – Control qubit C at node 0 prepared in (|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2  
    – Unknown input qubit S at node 1 in basis states { |0⟩,|1⟩ }  
  Pair sources (teleportation channel):
    – E1 between nodes 2↔3  
    – E2 between nodes 4↔5  
    – E3 between nodes 6↔7  
  Linear-optical modules:
    – Fredkin gate (post-selected) that, controlled by C (node 0), swaps S (node 1) with the photon at node 2 (the first leg of E1) when C=|1⟩, or leaves S in mode “direct” when C=|0⟩  
    – Bell measurement (entanglement swapping) on modes 2 & 3 (the teleportation BSM)  
    – Routing beam-splitters that recombine the teleported photon (emerging from E2/E3 chain) with the direct photon path  
  Detectors & Heralding:
    – Two ancillary detectors herald the successful Fredkin+BMS pattern (nodes a,b)  
    – Output detectors at the receiver measure the recombined photon in a basis chosen to reveal coherent superposition between the two channels.  
  Input/Output Role:
    – in_nodes: [1] (unknown qubit S)  
    – out_nodes: [4] (final recombined mode)  
    – control node C (0) is also read out to verify correlation.

Target Protocol Verification:
  Fix S in computational basis |0⟩ or |1⟩. Conditioned on ancilla herald clicks, the joint correlations between control (measured in X basis) and the receiver’s measurement outcomes (in X basis) exhibit high‐visibility interference, proving coherent superposition of teleportation vs identity channel.

Why It's Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First linear‐optical implementation of a superposed quantum communication primitive mixing teleportation and direct transmission.  
  – Directly merges nonlocal entanglement‐swap correlations with a high‐level protocol (indefinite channel order).  
  – Opens the door to superposing other network protocols—multi-path repeater chains, coded communication channels—without feedback.  
  – Serves as a template for programmable quantum routers, indefinite‐order networks, and new measurement-based communication primitives.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,” using a control photon to coherently route between direct transmission and teleportation and observing their interference. There is no new network primitive or measurement strategy beyond that already described.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme duplicates the existing ensemble target “Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation.” To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally different superposition protocol or measurement primitive not already covered by that design.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three Pytheus‐compatible ways to unite nonlocal quantum correlations with a bona‐fide quantum protocol (beyond pure state generation):  
    a) Quantum butterfly network coding – simultaneous two-way teleportation through a shared repeater (close to known designs).  
    b) 2×2 entanglement-percolation conference key agreement on a square lattice (echoes existing percolation/QKD setups).  
    c) Bilocality‐test network: two independent Bell-pair sources, a joint measurement at the central node, and local measurements at the ends to violate a bilocality inequality (a fundamental network nonlocality protocol).  
  Step 2: Checked novelty and feasibility:  
    – (a) and (b) overlap existing literature and past Pytheus designs.  
    – (c) No Pytheus experiment has yet implemented a true bilocality-inequality violation in a static photonic network. It uses only two probabilistic pair sources, a single static joint measurement (no feedback), and local single-qubit measurements—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
  Step 3: Choose (c).  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it moves beyond basic entanglement swapping or teleportation setups and implements a fundamental network nonlocality test—the bilocality inequality—in a purely linear-optical, post-selected experiment.  
  Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, static linear-optical elements to realize a two-qubit joint measurement at the central node, and local single-qubit detectors at the end-nodes, with post-selection via ancilla heralding.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
  Bilocality-test network: a three-node linear-optical experiment demonstrating violation of the bilocality inequality. Two independent probabilistic entangled‐photon sources connect node A to B (P_AB) and B to C (P_BC). Node B performs a single static joint measurement on its two photons (a partial Bell-state analyzer implemented with beam splitters and ancilla detectors). Nodes A and C each perform one of two fixed single‐qubit measurements (e.g. Z or X basis). Conditioned on a particular coincidence outcome at B, the joint statistics at A and C violate the bilocality inequality, revealing genuinely non-bilocal correlations.

General Structure (abstract nodes 0–7):
  Pair Sources:
    P_AB: connects A (node 0) ↔ B_in1 (node 1)  
    P_BC: connects B_in2 (node 2) ↔ C (node 3)  
  Central Measurement at B:
    – Linear-optical network (“BSM_B”) on modes 1 & 2 using beam splitters and phase shifts  
    – Four ancilla detectors at nodes 4–7 to herald one of four joint outcomes  
  Local Measurements:
    – A’s detector on node 0 measures in randomly chosen basis (Z or X)  
    – C’s detector on node 3 measures in the corresponding basis  
  Heralding:
    – A two-click pattern in {4–7} post-selects the successful joint measurement event at B  

Target Quantum Correlations:
  The conditional output‐outcome correlations between A and C—tagged by B’s heralding outcome—should maximally violate the bilocality inequality  
  (mapping to four classical bit-strings for measurement outcomes).  
  For basis choice fixed to Z:
    target_quantum = ['00','01','10','11']  
  (these denote A–C outcome pairs correlated to a chosen B outcome.)

Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First purely linear-optical demonstration of bilocality inequality violation, probing network nonlocality beyond standard Bell tests.  
  – Applies a genuine quantum‐information protocol (the bilocality test) rather than mere state generation.  
  – Direct extension to larger networks (triangle, star, 2D lattices) and more complex network‐nonlocality inequalities.  
  – Opens a pathway to foundational studies of nonlocal correlations in scalable quantum repeater and communication architectures.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed experiment—using two independent SPDC sources, a central linear‐optical Bell‐swap measurement at B, and local basis choices at A and C to violate a bilocality inequality—is not in the existing ensemble or prior list. All earlier suggestions focused on state generation, teleportation primitives, or triangle‐network nonlocality, but none implemented the bilocality test on a linear‐optical line network. Demonstrating genuine non‐bilocal correlations via post-selected Bell swaps and local measurements is a foundational, nontrivial network‐nonlocality protocol that goes beyond simple entanglement swapping and is worthy of further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This scheme provides the first purely linear-optical bilocality violation test, combining independent entangled‐pair sources and a static BSM at the central node to certify non-bilocal correlations in post-selected runs. It targets a genuine network-nonlocality inequality (bilocality) rather than state generation alone, and opens the door to device-independent network tests and scalable repeater‐chain nonlocality studies—making it compelling and novel enough for in‐depth exploration.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality

Abstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A–C correlations—tagged by B’s heralding pattern—to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal uses PyTheus’s graph‐based design to engineer a three‐node photonic network with two independent SPDC sources and a partial Bell‐state analyzer at the central node, then conditions A–C correlations on B’s heralded outcomes to directly violate the bilocality inequality. This is a clear application of PyTheus to an advanced quantum communication protocol (not mere state generation) and is experimentally feasible with existing single‐photon sources, interferometers, and photon‐number‐resolving detection.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a well‐posed application of PyTheus to design a genuine three‐node bilocality test, leveraging independent pair sources and heralded partial BSMs to reveal non‐bilocal correlations. The measurement scenario is both novel and within reach of current linear‐optical technology.
