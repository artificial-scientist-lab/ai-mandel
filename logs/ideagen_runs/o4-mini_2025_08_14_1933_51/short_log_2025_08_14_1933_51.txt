Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to meaningfully combine “entanglement-assisted code” (i.e. using preshared entanglement to boost classical or quantum channel capacities, e.g. superdense coding) with “entanglement-assisted quantum code” (i.e. quantum error–correcting codes that consume preshared ebits to encode a qubit into multiple physical carriers).  
  • Option A: A linear‐optical teleportation channel that encodes one logical qubit at sender A into three photons via an entanglement-assisted (3,1) code (using two preshared Bell pairs), sends them through two intermediate nodes B and C via entanglement swapping, then decodes at receiver D—post-selected, no active feed-forward.  
  • Option B: A four‐node “butterfly” network implementing quantum network coding: two senders A and B each have one qubit to send to two receivers C and D. They use preshared entanglement with an intermediate node X to perform entanglement-assisted superdense coding of classical side-information, then use an entanglement-assisted quantum error detection code on the carrier qubits to protect both classical and quantum payloads from loss.  
  • Option C (more speculative): A measurement‐based linear‐optical cluster-state protocol (without generating the full cluster state) that simultaneously carries out superdense coding on one logical qubit and error-detection on another qubit using preshared ebits—effectively a hybrid entanglement-assisted code for two logical channels multiplexed through the same optics.  

Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles  
  • A is novel—no prior Pytheus experiment combines teleportation and EAQECC encoding/decoding as a single network transform. It is purely a multi-node routing + error-detecting channel, not state generation. All elements (Bell‐pair sources, beam splitters, Bell‐measurements, post-selection) are within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
  • B is intriguing but more complex: network coding + EAQECC may push Pytheus past four or five nodes. Implementable in principle but risk hitting combinatorial complexity.  
  • C verges on measurement‐based computing, which might be misinterpreted as state generation. Also more speculative in abstract encoding.  

Step 3: Pick Option A. It is both novel (no one has proposed a teleportation channel protected by an entanglement-assisted code in linear optics) and feasible in Pytheus: 1 input photon, 2 Bell‐pair sources (=4 photons), ancilla detectors for code syndrome, one Bell measurement at encoding, two Bell‐swapping measurements at relays, final Bell measurement at decoding. No dynamic feedback—pure post-selection.  

Step 4: This idea is novel because it fuses an entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code ((3,1) EAQECC) with a multi-node teleportation network in one linear-optical architecture. Prior Pytheus examples only perform entanglement swapping or high-dimensional Bell‐state generation; none embed a code protecting a logical qubit across several hops.  

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:  
  • We only ask Pytheus to design a static linear-optical network of probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, beam splitters, and post-selected Bell measurements.  
  • We avoid any requirement for dynamic feed-forward or real-time error correction.  
  • The target is a quantum channel transformation (encode→swap→decode), not a specific state.  
  • All physical resources (Bell-pair sources, detectors, linear optics) are within Pytheus’s model.

Description: “Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC‐Teleport)”  
Explanation:  
We propose a linear-optical network to realize a single‐qubit quantum channel from sender A to receiver D that is both teleported across two intermediate nodes B and C and protected against single-photon loss via an entanglement-assisted (3,1) error-detecting code.  The protocol consumes two preshared Bell pairs between A and the two relay nodes for encoding, then uses two more Bell pairs between the relays and D for decoding. Encoding and decoding are each implemented by post-selected Bell measurements (no active feed-forward), and entanglement swapping at B and C routes the logical qubit to D.  Successful runs herald both correct teleportation and detection of any single‐photon erasure.  This network generalizes to more relays or higher‐distance EAQECCs and explores the interplay of superdense-coding–style entanglement assistance (supervision of code syndromes) with teleportation‐based routing in quantum networks.  

Config (sketch):  
n_pair_sources: 4  # two for encoding at A−B and A−C, two for decoding at C−D and B−D  
n_anc_detectors: 2  # syndrome measurement ancillas for EAQECC  
edges_tried: 40  
target_transformation: “Logical qubit at A → teleported, error-detected qubit at D”  
removed_connections: enforce no direct source connecting A to D, B to C, or cross-links that bypass code structure  
postselection: herald on all four Bell measurements and ancilla detectors  
optim: L-BFGS-B, loss_func: channel_fidelity   

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond simple entanglement swapping or purification by embedding an entanglement-assisted (3,1) error‐detecting code directly into a teleportation‐based channel, with only static linear optics and post‐selection. None of the prior examples or ensemble ideas employ EAQECC to simultaneously encode, route, teleport, and herald single‐photon erasures in one “teleporter‐with‐syndrome” primitive. It targets a genuine quantum‐channel transformation (not just state generation) with built‐in loss detection and can be scaled to higher distances. This appears sufficiently novel and nontrivial for further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The entanglement‐assisted teleported error‐detecting channel combines teleportation and EAQECC in a way not seen in existing linear‐optical network protocols. It realizes a protected quantum channel (not merely a state) with heralded single‐photon‐loss detection using only static Bell measurements and ancilla syndrome clicks. This fresh fusion of coding and routing merits further development.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)

Abstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation—teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure—by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal outlines a purely communication‐theoretic transformation—teleporting a logical qubit while heralding single-photon loss—using entanglement‐assisted error detection rather than targeting a new state generation. The physics is sound in that it leverages SPDC‐based Bell pairs, post‐selected Bell measurements, and entanglement swapping in a relay architecture, and it remains feasible within current linear‐optics toolkits (albeit resource‐intensive). Action: accept  
Action Input: Embedding a (3,1) entanglement‐assisted error‐detecting code into a teleportation protocol is a clever way to detect photon erasures, and PyTheus can be used to fine‐tune the SPDC pair sources and beam‐splitter network for that heralded transformation. Although the required resource overhead of four probabilistic Bell pairs and multi‐photon coincidences is high, the scheme is implementable with today’s high‐quality SPDC and Bell‐measurement setups.
