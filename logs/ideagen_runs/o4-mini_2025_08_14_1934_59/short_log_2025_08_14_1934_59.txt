Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to link “non-Gaussian state” and “superconducting quantum processor” in a Pytheus-compatible target, each focusing on network primitives (swapping or teleportation) rather than raw state generation:
  1. Heralded non-Gaussian Bell-measurement for entanglement swapping: inject a single-photon ancilla into the swapping node of two Bell-pairs so that the resulting entanglement between the distant superconducting qubits carries non-Gaussian correlations.
  2. Gate teleportation of a non-Gaussian single-qubit rotation (a so-called “cubic-phase”–style operation) from a photonic ancilla network onto a remote superconducting qubit, using linear optics, single-photon pair sources, and photon-number resolving detectors.
  3. Cascaded entanglement swapping across three superconducting nodes, where the middle node uses a photon-subtraction operator (implemented by a single-photon ancilla + PNR detection) to non-Gaussianly “sharpen” the entangled link before swapping onward.
Step 2: Check novelty vs. past Pytheus experiments:
  1. Past experiments cover only Gaussian Bell swaps in various dimensions (2D, 3D, 4D) or higher-dim heralded gates. They do not inject an extra non-Gaussian ancilla at the Bell-measurement node. 
     Obstacles: specifying the target entangled state with nonzero higher-Fock components; Pytheus can handle abstract states by listing basis strings.
  2. Gate teleportation with a non-Gaussian gate has never appeared; however, Pytheus can optimize for a target output for each basis input by treating the gate as a family of target states. 
     Obstacles: need to encode a unitary map rather than a single state; Pytheus only optimizes for pure output states given vacuum ancillas and sources—but one can separately optimize for each basis input.
  3. Cascaded non-Gaussian swap is more complex but extends the first idea; it remains within pair sources + PNR detectors.
Step 3: Pick the most promising: idea 1 (Heralded non-Gaussian Bell-measurement for entanglement swapping). 
Step 4: Novelty: No previous Pytheus experiments combine entanglement swapping with an injected single-photon ancilla to alter the joint measurement basis into a non-Gaussian projector. This both generalizes standard Bell swap and introduces non-Gaussianity in the entanglement distribution, opening new questions about resource overhead, fidelity, and non-Gaussian entanglement distillation across superconducting nodes.
Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus: 
  • Abstract target state: a three-term superposition in a 3-level Hilbert space at the two output nodes (the two distant qubits plus an extra Fock level), e.g. |00>+|11>+|22>. 
  • Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon ancillary input, linear multiport network, and photon-number resolving detectors. 
  • Fits Pytheus’s model: it uses abstract discrete basis (no actual CV or cavity physics), no dynamic feed-forward, and can be generalized to higher ancilla Fock numbers for N-dimensional non-Gaussian swapping.

Description of Proposed Target Experiment:  
“Heralded non-Gaussian entanglement swapping between two remote superconducting qubits.”  

Explanation:  
We aim to entangle two distant superconducting qubits A and D by swapping two standard photonic Bell pairs (A–B and C–D) at a central station, but crucially we modify the Bell-measurement at B–C by injecting a single-photon ancilla (a non-Gaussian resource) and performing photon-number resolving (PNR) detection. Instead of the usual Gaussian Bell projectors, the PNR measurement plus ancilla implements a non-Gaussian joint projection that heralds an entangled state across A–D of the form  
   Ψ_AD = |0,0> + |1,1> + |2,2>  
(in abstract three-level basis, without normalization).

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:  
  • Explores how a single non-Gaussian ancilla transforms the fundamental Bell swap primitive.  
  • Opens a family of experiments: vary ancilla Fock number (|k>) to produce k-dimensional non-Gaussian entanglement.  
  • Directly relevant to hybrid networks connecting photonic channels and superconducting nodes, where non-Gaussian resources are scarce but crucial for quantum advantage.  
  • Lays groundwork for non-Gaussian entanglement distillation and distribution protocols in next-generation quantum networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal introduces a genuinely new twist on the standard entanglement‐swapping primitive by using a single‐photon Fock ancilla to implement a non‐Gaussian joint measurement that upgrades two qubit Bell pairs into a heralded qutrit–qutrit entangled state |00⟩+|11⟩+|22⟩. I do not see any example in our human‐explored list or the ensemble suggestions that injects a non‐Gaussian ancilla into a Bell‐swap to boost the output dimension in this way. The idea also carries a clear recipe for generalization (ancilla |k⟩ → (k+1)-dimensional entanglement) and ties directly into hybrid photonic–superconducting networks where non‐Gaussian resources are scarce yet critical. This goes beyond “just generating a state” — it defines a new measurement‐induced transformation primitive. Action: accept. Action Input: This non‐Gaussian Bell‐swap is a novel network primitive with no obvious precedent in our lists, offers a clear path to higher‐dimensional entanglement distribution, and could open a new family of experiments on non‐Gaussian network operations, meriting further study.
