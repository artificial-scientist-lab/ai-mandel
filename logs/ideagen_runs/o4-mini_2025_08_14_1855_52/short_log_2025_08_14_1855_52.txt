Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: I need to propose a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network experiment—no state‐generation targets—that combines a teleportation protocol with the physics of Wigner‐function negativity.  
Step 2: Brainstorm three ways to marry these concepts:

  1. A d = 3 teleportation network that is explicitly optimized to preserve the discrete Wigner‐function negativity of an arbitrary input qutrit—i.e. design the Bell‐measurement plus post‐selection network so that negative “phase‐point” values survive the teleport.  
  2. A two‐hop teleportation chain (Alice→Charlie→Bob) over qutrits, where each hop is designed to map and then re‐inject Wigner negativity, allowing study of “negativity decay” through successive linear‐optics teleportation steps.  
  3. A network that interleaves a single‐mode non‐Gaussian ancilla (heralded photon subtraction on one arm) inside a qubit teleportation circuit to generate negativity at an intermediate stage—even though the final goal is purely to teleport an input, one sees how measurement‐induced negativity can boost fidelity.  

Step 3: Check novelty/obstacles:

  1. The single‐hop qutrit case above is novel (no one’s optimized a discrete‐Wigner‐negativity–preserving Bell measurement for qutrit teleportation in linear optics). Past Pytheus experiments did qutrit entanglement‐swapping or Bell analyzers but never with a figure‐of‐merit tied to Wigner negativity. Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize a network of linear optics, ancilla photons, and number‐resolving detectors to implement a d = 3 Bell measurement and a post‐selected teleportation channel. It just needs “in_node,” “out_node,” “anc_detectors,” “removed_connections,” and “single_emitters” or “pair_sources.”  
  2. The two‐hop chain is more complex, effectively back‐to‐back teleportation. It could be done but doubles the resources; Pytheus might bog down in too many ancillas.  
  3. Interleaving non‐Gaussian ancilla for qubit teleportation is attractive but crosses into hybrid protocols (photon subtraction), and Pytheus treats everything abstractly; it cannot specify a subtraction operation.  

Step 4: Pick idea 1.

This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus‐designed experiment has ever combined a d = 3 teleportation network with an explicit figure‐of‐merit tied to the preservation of discrete Wigner‐function negativity. Bell‐measurement designs for qutrits exist, but none are optimized for negativity‐preservation—and negativity is the signature of non‐classicality in phase‐space.  

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only need linear optics, probabilistic photon‐pair sources (to generate the pre‐shared Bell pair), number‐resolving detectors, post‐selection, and the usual abstract encoding of qutrits. No feedback control, hyper‐entanglement, or cavities are required, and we treat the input as an abstract mode.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input: 
“Inspired by the fundamental role of Wigner‐function negativity as a resource for quantum advantage, we propose a discrete‐variable teleportation experiment that is explicitly optimized to preserve Wigner negativity through a linear‐optics teleportation channel in dimension d = 3. Rather than aiming at state generation, this is a teleportation network whose success metric is the fidelity of teleporting Wigner‐negative test states.  

Experiment sketch:  
– Modes and parties:  
   • Mode 0: Alice’s unknown qutrit input (arbitrary superposition in {∣0⟩,∣1⟩,∣2⟩}).  
   • Modes 1&2: Pre‐shared qutrit Bell pair produced by one probabilistic pair‐source (mode 1 to Alice, mode 2 to Bob).  
   • Modes 3–6: Four ancillary single photons (or pair‐source halves) injected at Alice’s station for realizing a generalized d = 3 Bell‐state measurement by linear optics and number‐resolving detection.  
   • Mode 7–8: (Optional) Heralding photons if using two pair‐sources for ancilla.  

– Network architecture:  
   1. At Alice: a linear‐optics interferometer combining mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (resource) with the four ancilla photons (modes 3–6).  
   2. Number‐resolving detectors on modes 3–6 post‐select one of the nine generalized Bell‐states. No active feed‐forward; we succeed only when a permitted click‐pattern occurs.  
   3. The unmeasured port (mode 2 at Bob) emerges as the teleported output (mode out).  

– Constraints:  
   • removed_connections: ban any direct link from mode 0 → mode 2 so that the state can only reach Bob by passing through Alice’s Bell measurement.  
   • single_emitters / pair_sources: identify the two sources for the Bell pair and four ancilla photons.  
   • anc_detectors: [3,4,5,6]; out_node: 2; in_node: 0.  

– Performance metric: teleportation fidelity on two representative Wigner‐negative qutrit states, e.g.  
   Ψ₁ = (|0⟩ + |2⟩ − |1⟩)/√3,  Ψ₂ = (|0⟩ + e^{2πi/3}|1⟩ + e^{−2πi/3}|2⟩)/√3.  
Pytheus will optimize beamsplitter angles and routing to maximize fidelity for Ψ₁ and Ψ₂, which directly tests negativity‐preservation.  

Why this is exciting:  
  – It bridges teleportation—a paradigmatic quantum network primitive—with the modern resource theory of Wigner‐function negativity.  
  – The same setup generalizes to higher d or multi‐hop chains, illuminating how negativity degrades (or survives) in complex quantum networks.  
  – Even if not yet built, the theory work on optimal linear‐optics teleporters for non‐Gaussianity could be a stand‐alone PRL.  

We ask Pytheus to search for the minimal‐ancilla, linear‐optics configuration that realizes a post‐selected qutrit teleportation channel with maximum average Wigner‐negativity‐state fidelity.”

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond a “new way to teleport qutrits” and instead sets a fresh, operational target: design and demonstrate a linear-optics teleportation channel whose figure of merit is explicit preservation of discrete-Wigner negativity. I know of no prior linear-optics qutrit teleporter that has been optimized for Wigner‐function negativity as a resource. It is not mere state generation, but a characterization of a channel resource, and it bridges teleportation with modern resource theory. While the ancilla count and post-selection scheme resemble other Bell-measurement constructions, the emphasis on preserving nonclassicality (and quantifying its degradation in networked settings) is genuinely novel. This could yield both an experimental demonstration and a proof of fundamental bounds on negativity transfer in linear optics—enough for a selective PRL.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: I accept this target. It is a bona fide new quantum-network primitive (a Wigner‐negativity–preserving qutrit teleporter) with both experimental and resource-theoretic novelty, not previously captured in the literature or in our ensemble.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3

Abstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (Ψ₁,Ψ₂), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal seeks to design a post-selected qutrit teleportation channel—i.e. a non-unitary, measurement-based transformation—using PyTheus to optimize a linear-optics interferometer for Bell-measurement success and Wigner-negativity preservation. This lies squarely within PyTheus’s capabilities (design of measurements and protocols), and leveraging photon-number–resolving detectors and ancillas to distinguish qutrit Bell states is a timely, feasible extension.  

Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a compelling use of PyTheus to engineer a post-selected qutrit teleportation protocol, trading real-time feed-forward for heralded success via specific multi-photon coincidences. Optimizing beam-splitter settings to maximize Wigner-negativity fidelity is both novel and physically well-motivated, and the resource requirements are within reach of current linear-optics platforms.
