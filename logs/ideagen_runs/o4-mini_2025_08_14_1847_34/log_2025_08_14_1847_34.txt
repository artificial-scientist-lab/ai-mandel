    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas. THE FEEDBACK IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT !!! FOR SURE LOOK AT THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE CORE IDEA OF THEM!! YOU HAVE FAILED SO OFTEN BEFORE, FREAKING TAKE IT SERIOUS!\n\nSTART OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n<existing_feedback>\nEND OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n\nThis feedback is extremely important and very valuable information. It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought: \n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d with \u201csymmetry\u2010protected bound state\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network target:\n    1) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state-encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into a two\u2010mode symmetry-protected bound\u2010state subspace (protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), then teleport it across a three\u2010node chain using entanglement swapping. The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings.

We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

    "output": "Thought: While teleporting a two-photon \u201cbound\u2010state\u201d logical qubit via swapping and comparing heralding rates is an interesting twist on dual\u2010rail teleportation, it does not introduce a genuinely new measurement\u2010induced transformation or network primitive beyond existing entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation variants. Encoding in the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace is essentially a straightforward extension of multi\u2010mode teleportation, and the claimed \u201cenhanced absorption\u201d lacks a clear mechanism that distinguishes it from simply having two photons available for heralding. This remains an incremental performance comparison rather than a fundamentally novel target (e.g., no new nontrivial bound\u2010state physics or topological protection is demonstrated).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The proposal must go beyond re\u2010encoding a qubit in two photons and running a standard swap\u2010based teleporter.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings.

We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels.

Encoding in the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace is essentially a straightforward extension of multi\u2010mode teleportation, and the claimed \u201cenhanced absorption\u201d lacks a clear mechanism that distinguishes it from simply having two photons available for heralding. This remains an incremental performance comparison rather than a fundamentally novel target (e.g., no new nontrivial bound\u2010state physics or topological protection is demonstrated).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The proposal must go beyond re\u2010encoding a qubit in two photons and running a standard swap\u2010based teleporter.

A standard Bell-pair source creates an entangled resource between Charlie\u2019s modes C\u2080,C\u2081 and Bob\u2019s modes B\u2080,B\u2081. Alice and Charlie perform a joint four-mode Bell measurement that respects the same symmetry, heralding teleportation of the bound-state qubit from A\u2080,A\u2081 to B\u2080,B\u2081. By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The post-selected state between Alice and Bob is a Bell pair; comparing its fidelity and heralding rate against a reference entanglement swap quantifies the enhancement due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound state.\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swapping with a symmetry-protected bound-state filter\",\n  foldername: \"SymBoundFilterSwap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                   # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 10,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],  # project modes 0&3 onto the Bell subspace\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],             # Alice\u2019s mode 0 and Bob\u2019s mode 3 carry the swapped entanglement\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],         # Charlie\u2019s detectors on modes 1&2\n  single_emitters: [],          # SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [[0,3],[1,2]],  # forbid direct cross-pair sources\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2]\n}"

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive. Pytheus can optimize linear\u2010optical networks for four modes plus ancillas and post\u2010selection.  \n 2) Option 2 is close to standard teleportation with an encoding twist, less network\u2010theoretic novelty.  \n 3) Option 3 is scalable but may exceed resource limits for a first setup.\n\nStep 3: Choose option 1.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a non\u2010trivial \u201cbound\u2010state filter\u201d (projection onto the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace) to the role of an entanglement\u2010distillation primitive. Constructive interference in that protected subspace directly enhances heralding, a mechanism absent from prior linear\u2010optical distillation or swapping schemes.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics, number\u2010resolving detectors, and post\u2010selection\u2014exactly the toolkit Pytheus handles. The bound\u2010state lives in an abstract two\u2010mode qubit space, so no physical implementation details are required.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry\u2010Protected Bound\u2010State Entanglement Distillation\n\nexplanation:\n  Two SPDC sources each produce a Bell pair on modes (0,1) and (2,3).

Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Provide a concrete mechanism and target map demonstrating genuinely new physics.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Experiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding.

No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

A standard Bell-pair source creates an entangled resource between Charlie\u2019s modes C\u2080,C\u2081 and Bob\u2019s modes B\u2080,B\u2081. Alice and Charlie perform a joint four-mode Bell measurement that respects the same symmetry, heralding teleportation of the bound-state qubit from A\u2080,A\u2081 to B\u2080,B\u2081. By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace directly enhances heralding, a mechanism absent from prior linear\u2010optical distillation or swapping schemes.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics, number\u2010resolving detectors, and post\u2010selection\u2014exactly the toolkit Pytheus handles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap. Pytheus can optimize a three-port linear-optical network plus ancilla detectors to implement any desired projection. \n 2) Option #2 reduces to a teleportation variant\u2014less network-primitive novelty.\n 3) Option #3 is interesting but resource-heavy and complex for a first demonstration.\n\nStep 3: Choose Option #1.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a genuine symmetry-protected bound-state eigenmode\u2014realized by a C\u2083-symmetric multiport\u2014as the measurement primitive in entanglement swapping. The bound eigenmode is a non-trivial two-photon \u201cbound state\u201d in a continuum of three spatial channels, and its protected interference enhances heralding. No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement. It requires no extra dynamic control or cavities and showcases a truly new symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state effect within a quantum network transformation.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be novel, you need to identify a transformation or bound-state phenomenon that cannot be emulated by standard symmetric-subspace filters. For instance, propose a non-Hermitian or topologically protected bound-mode operation, or exploit a true photon-photon bound state in a nonlinear or synthetic quantum material that yields an unimplemented network primitive. Provide a clear target map or effect that goes beyond simply boosting heralding by using extra symmetric modes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

A standard Bell-pair source creates an entangled resource between Charlie\u2019s modes C\u2080,C\u2081 and Bob\u2019s modes B\u2080,B\u2081. Alice and Charlie perform a joint four-mode Bell measurement that respects the same symmetry, heralding teleportation of the bound-state qubit from A\u2080,A\u2081 to B\u2080,B\u2081. By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace directly enhances heralding, a mechanism absent from prior linear\u2010optical distillation or swapping schemes.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics, number\u2010resolving detectors, and post\u2010selection\u2014exactly the toolkit Pytheus handles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap. Pytheus can optimize a three-port linear-optical network plus ancilla detectors to implement any desired projection. \n 2) Option #2 reduces to a teleportation variant\u2014less network-primitive novelty.\n 3) Option #3 is interesting but resource-heavy and complex for a first demonstration.\n\nStep 3: Choose Option #1.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a genuine symmetry-protected bound-state eigenmode\u2014realized by a C\u2083-symmetric multiport\u2014as the measurement primitive in entanglement swapping. The bound eigenmode is a non-trivial two-photon \u201cbound state\u201d in a continuum of three spatial channels, and its protected interference enhances heralding. No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

For instance, propose a non-Hermitian or topologically protected bound-mode operation, or exploit a true photon-photon bound state in a nonlinear or synthetic quantum material that yields an unimplemented network primitive.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace directly enhances heralding, a mechanism absent from prior linear\u2010optical distillation or swapping schemes.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics, number\u2010resolving detectors, and post\u2010selection\u2014exactly the toolkit Pytheus handles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap. Pytheus can optimize a three-port linear-optical network plus ancilla detectors to implement any desired projection. \n 2) Option #2 reduces to a teleportation variant\u2014less network-primitive novelty.\n 3) Option #3 is interesting but resource-heavy and complex for a first demonstration.\n\nStep 3: Choose Option #1.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a genuine symmetry-protected bound-state eigenmode\u2014realized by a C\u2083-symmetric multiport\u2014as the measurement primitive in entanglement swapping. The bound eigenmode is a non-trivial two-photon \u201cbound state\u201d in a continuum of three spatial channels, and its protected interference enhances heralding. No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement. It requires no extra dynamic control or cavities and showcases a truly new symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state effect within a quantum network transformation.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be novel, you need to identify a transformation or bound-state phenomenon that cannot be emulated by standard symmetric-subspace filters. For instance, propose a non-Hermitian or topologically protected bound-mode operation, or exploit a true photon-photon bound state in a nonlinear or synthetic quantum material that yields an unimplemented network primitive. Provide a clear target map or effect that goes beyond simply boosting heralding by using extra symmetric modes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace directly enhances heralding, a mechanism absent from prior linear\u2010optical distillation or swapping schemes.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics, number\u2010resolving detectors, and post\u2010selection\u2014exactly the toolkit Pytheus handles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap. Pytheus can optimize a three-port linear-optical network plus ancilla detectors to implement any desired projection. \n 2) Option #2 reduces to a teleportation variant\u2014less network-primitive novelty.\n 3) Option #3 is interesting but resource-heavy and complex for a first demonstration.\n\nStep 3: Choose Option #1.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a genuine symmetry-protected bound-state eigenmode\u2014realized by a C\u2083-symmetric multiport\u2014as the measurement primitive in entanglement swapping. The bound eigenmode is a non-trivial two-photon \u201cbound state\u201d in a continuum of three spatial channels, and its protected interference enhances heralding. No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement. It requires no extra dynamic control or cavities and showcases a truly new symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state effect within a quantum network transformation.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be novel, you need to identify a transformation or bound-state phenomenon that cannot be emulated by standard symmetric-subspace filters. For instance, propose a non-Hermitian or topologically protected bound-mode operation, or exploit a true photon-photon bound state in a nonlinear or synthetic quantum material that yields an unimplemented network primitive. Provide a clear target map or effect that goes beyond simply boosting heralding by using extra symmetric modes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network.

Successful clicks at Charlie\u2019s ancilla detectors herald both entanglement swapping and the action of a \u201cbound-state filter.\u201d Because constructive interference in this protected subspace enhances the coupling into the detectors, the overall heralding probability (effective \u201cabsorption\u201d) exceeds that of a standard linear-optical Bell-state analyzer.

The constructive interference of that protected (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace yields a higher heralding (absorption) probability than a standard partial Bell\u2010measurement distillation.\n 2) Teleportation of a bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit: encode a logical qubit into the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace, then teleport it via a central four\u2010mode symmetry\u2010protected Bell analyzer, comparing heralding efficiency to dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) A repeater chain of bound\u2010state\u2010filtered swapping: sequentially fuse multiple Bell pairs with symmetry\u2010protected filters to extend entanglement over many nodes with boosted heralding at each link.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility:\n 1) Option 1 is fully new\u2014no existing Pytheus example uses a bound\u2010state filter as a distillation primitive.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap.

Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

Constructive two\u2010photon interference into that bound mode yields an elevated heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d), a mechanism not captured by any standard Bell\u2010analyzer or symmetric\u2010subspace projector in existing Pytheus experiments.\n\nStep 5: Feasibility: It uses only SPDC pair sources, linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters forming a multiport), and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s design space. The bound\u2010state lives as an abstract two\u2010photon eigenmode; no physical implementation detail (cavities, nonlinearities) is needed, and no feedback is required.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Fano\u2010Bound\u2010State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  Two independent SPDC sources produce Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s station, modes 1 and 2 are mixed with two ancillary vacuum modes (4,5) in a Pytheus\u2010designed linear\u2010optical multiport engineered to host a Fano\u2010resonance\u2013style bound state: a symmetry\u2010protected two\u2010photon eigenmode embedded in the continuum of four-port network. When two photons enter the multiport, they preferentially occupy that bound mode and emerge at two heralding detectors monitoring the bound\u2010state outputs. A click pattern on detectors 4 and 5 both (a) implements entanglement swapping\u2014leaving modes 0 and 3 in a Bell state\u2014and (b) exhibits an elevated heralding probability (\u201cenhanced absorption\u201d) compared to a conventional two\u2010port Bell analyzer. By benchmarking swap fidelity and heralding rates against a reference swap circuit, one directly quantifies the absorption enhancement due to the Fano bound state. This primitive naturally generalizes to larger multiport symmetries or chained repeater nodes.\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a Fano\u2010resonance bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"FanoBoundSwap\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                       # two herald detectors at the bound\u2010state ports\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 20,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],      # Alice\u2019s mode 0 & Bob\u2019s mode 3 become a Bell pair\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [4,5],             # detectors on the bound\u2010state outputs\n  single_emitters: [],              # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [[0,3],[1,2]],# forbid cross\u2010pair SPDC links\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [4,5]\n}"

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

A click pattern on detectors 4 and 5 both (a) implements entanglement swapping\u2014leaving modes 0 and 3 in a Bell state\u2014and (b) exhibits an elevated heralding probability (\u201cenhanced absorption\u201d) compared to a conventional two\u2010port Bell analyzer. By benchmarking swap fidelity and heralding rates against a reference swap circuit, one directly quantifies the absorption enhancement due to the Fano bound state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping.

By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors.

By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Two SPDC sources at Senders S\u2081 and S\u2082 create Bell pairs on modes (0\u20131) and (2\u20133). S\u2081 retains mode 0 (its unknown qubit), S\u2082 retains mode 2. They send modes 1 and 3 into a four\u2010mode linear\u2010optical \u201cbound\u2010state router\u201d at Relay R. That router is a Pytheus\u2010optimized interferometer (beam splitters + phase shifters) engineered to support a symmetry\u2010protected two\u2010photon bound eigenmode (in analogy to a Fano\u2010type dark state). When both photons occupy this bound subspace, they exit into two heralding detectors (modes 1,3) with anomalously high probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d). A successful two-click event both (a) projects modes 0\u21925 and 2\u21924 into two cross\u2010linked Bell pairs\u2014i.e. teleporting S\u2081\u2192Receiver 2 (mode 5) and S\u2082\u2192Receiver 1 (mode 4)\u2014and (b) exhibits a higher heralding rate than a conventional two\u2010port Bell\u2010analyzer.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap.

This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding.

No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

A standard Bell-pair source creates an entangled resource between Charlie\u2019s modes C\u2080,C\u2081 and Bob\u2019s modes B\u2080,B\u2081. Alice and Charlie perform a joint four-mode Bell measurement that respects the same symmetry, heralding teleportation of the bound-state qubit from A\u2080,A\u2081 to B\u2080,B\u2081. By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Two incoming photons at the central swap node preferentially occupy that bound mode, boosting the herald probability when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleport a qubit encoded in a two\u2010mode symmetric bound\u2010state subspace via a four\u2010mode bound\u2010state Bell analyzer, benchmarked against dual\u2010rail teleportation.\n 3) Build a two\u2010link repeater chain where each link employs a symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state filter to sequentially swap entanglement with enhanced success.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option (1) is genuinely new\u2014no prior Pytheus example has realized a Fano\u2010type bound\u2010state projector in entanglement\u2010swap.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap.

This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

A click pattern on detectors 4 and 5 both (a) implements entanglement swapping\u2014leaving modes 0 and 3 in a Bell state\u2014and (b) exhibits an elevated heralding probability (\u201cenhanced absorption\u201d) compared to a conventional two\u2010port Bell analyzer. By benchmarking swap fidelity and heralding rates against a reference swap circuit, one directly quantifies the absorption enhancement due to the Fano bound state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap.

This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping.

By comparing the heralding probability and teleportation fidelity of this bound-state scheme to a reference dual-rail teleportation, one directly observes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d (higher post-selection rates) due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors.

By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state.

Option 1 is the most sharply defined network primitive\u2014a non-unitary amplifier (quantum scissor) targeted at the bound subspace\u2014yet fully implementable with SPDC, a single-photon emitter, beam splitters and detectors.  \n  Step 3: Select Option 1.  \n  Step 4: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment builds a **bound-state-selective quantum scissor**\u2014a linear-optical network that amplifies only the symmetric two-photon subspace\u2014then embeds it in an entanglement-swap. This realizes a genuinely new non-unitary map and directly probes \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d through heralding rates.  \n  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize beam splitter/phase networks plus ancilla sources and number-resolving detectors to implement any desired Kraus operator on a small mode set. All building blocks\u2014SPDC pair sources, single-photon emitters, linear optics and post-selection\u2014are in its toolbox; no cavities or feedback are needed.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Bound-State-Selective Quantum Scissor for Enhanced Teleportation\n\nexplanation:\n  We teleport a logical qubit encoded in two modes A\u2080,A\u2081 (Alice) to Bob\u2019s mode B via entanglement swapping at Charlie, but we first pass the two ancilla photons through a **symmetry-protected quantum scissor** that noiselessly amplifies only the two-photon symmetric (\u201cbound\u201d) subspace. Concretely:\n   1) Two SPDC sources emit Bell pairs on modes (A\u2081,C\u2081) and (A\u2082,C\u2082). Alice holds A\u2081,A\u2082; Charlie receives C\u2081,C\u2082.  \n   2) An ancilla single photon is injected into mode X via a single-photon emitter.  \n   3) At Charlie\u2019s station, modes C\u2081,C\u2082 and X are mixed in a Pytheus-designed linear-optical network (the bound-state scissor), whose click pattern on two herald detectors H\u2081,H\u2082 enacts the non-unitary map  \n        M_g \u221d g\u00b7P_sym  (P_sym projects onto Span{|01\u27e9+|10\u27e9})  \n      thereby **amplifying** the bound-state amplitude by gain g>1 and discarding the orthogonal subspace.  \n   4) Conditioned on an H\u2081\u2013H\u2082 click, the two amplified ancilla modes then enter a second Pytheus-designed Bell analyzer with one half of an SPDC pair on modes (B,C\u2083). A click on its herald detectors swaps the purified, amplified bound-state qubit onto Bob\u2019s mode B.  \n   5) We compare teleportation fidelity and overall heralding probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) against a reference network without the scissor. The symmetry-protected scissor yields **higher** post-selection rates for the same fidelity, directly linking bound-state protection to enhanced light absorption in a quantum network transformation.\n\nVisualization:\n  Emitters: [ SPDC\u2081\u2192(A\u2081,C\u2081)  |  SPDC\u2082\u2192(A\u2082,C\u2082)  |  single-photon\u2192X ]  \n  Module 1 (bound scissor): [ C\u2081,C\u2082,X \u2192 Pytheus network \u2192 H\u2081,H\u2082 ]  \n  Module 2 (Bell swap): [ one amplified ancilla mode + half of SPDC\u2083\u2192(B,C\u2083) \u2192 Pytheus network \u2192 H\u2083,H\u2084 ]  \n  Output: Bob\u2019s mode B holds the teleported bound-state qubit.\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description:   \"Teleportation of a bound-state qubit with pre-amplification via a symmetry-protected quantum scissor\",\n  foldername:    \"BoundScissorTeleport\",\n  bulk_thr:      0.01,\n  edges_tried:   30,\n  ftol:          1e-06,\n  loss_func:     \"cr_abs\",      # maximize herald probability given fidelity\n  num_anc:       4,             # H\u2081,H\u2082 for scissor + H\u2083,H\u2084 for swap\n  optimizer:     \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:       20,\n  single_emitters: [ X ],       # ancilla photon on mode X\n  pair_sources:  [[A\u2081,C\u2081],[A\u2082,C\u2082],[B,C\u2083]],\n  target_map:    \"M_g on symmetric subspace then Bell swap\", \n  removed_connections: [[X,A\u2080],[X,B]],  # prevent emitter from leaking to I/O modes\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [H\u2081,H\u2082,H\u2083,H\u2084]\n}\n\nGeneralizations:\n \u2022 Replace the two-mode bound qubit by a three-mode bound qutrit and design a scissor for the three-photon symmetric subspace.  \n \u2022 Chain multiple scissor-swap modules into a repeater with cumulative absorption enhancement.  \n \u2022 Vary the gain g to study the trade-off between amplification, fidelity and heralding in a symmetry-protected channel.\n\nThis target goes beyond state generation\u2014it's a new non-unitary network primitive (the bound-state scissor) embedded in a teleportation protocol.

Alice\u2019s unknown qubit (dual-rail modes A\u2080,A\u2081) is to be teleported to Bob\u2019s dual-rail modes B\u2080,B\u2081. Three SPDC pair sources generate ancilla pairs on modes (C\u2080,C\u2081), (C\u2082,C\u2083), (C\u2084,C\u2085). At Charlie\u2019s node the six modes C\u2080\u2026C\u2085 are mixed in a Pytheus-optimized multiport whose internal symmetry enforces a single two-photon \u201cbound\u201d eigenmode protected by a C\u2084 rotation symmetry. Whenever the two qubit-input photons from Alice plus the four ancilla photons collectively populate that bound mode, constructive interference concentrates them into four heralding detectors H\u2080\u2026H\u2083. This implements a near-complete Bell-state discrimination: each of the four Bell states produces a unique click pattern with total success probability \u224875%.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum key distribution in a packet-switched network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Strong quantum nonlocality for unextendible product bases in\n  heterogeneous systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Transformation of Bell states using linear optics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

The bound\u2010state encoding enhances heralding rates (\u201cabsorption\u201d) because its symmetric wavefunction couples more efficiently into detectors.\n    2) Entanglement relay in a chain of N nodes: prepare symmetry-protected bound-state entanglement on each link; perform sequential symmetry-respecting Bell measurements to swap entanglement from node 1 to node N. The bound\u2010state structure yields higher cumulative absorption (herald rates) and is robust against photon loss. \n    3) Superdense coding with bound-state qudits: symmetrically encode two classical bits into a two-photon bound state; distribute half the bound-state to Bob via an entanglement\u2010swapping network. Bob decodes by a symmetry-protected measurement that benefits from enhanced absorption cross section.\n\n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus obstacles:\n    1) Bound\u2010state-qubit teleportation is not in the explored list; it\u2019s a transformation (teleportation) rather than pure state generation. Pytheus can handle Bell\u2010type swap networks and abstract qubit encodings. Main obstacle: need to define the bound\u2010state basis abstractly and ask Pytheus for the minimal ancilla network.\n    2) N-node relay generalizes entanglement swapping to symmetry-protected resources\u2014novel but more complex; might be too large for initial implementation.\n    3) Superdense coding with bound states is novel but effectively reduces to a Bell-state network plus modified measurement basis; less striking than teleportation of a bound-state.\n\n  Step 3: Pick the bound\u2010state qubit teleportation (option 1) as it is novel, clearly a transformation, sized for Pytheus, and directly showcases enhanced absorption (heralding).\n\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has teleported a logical qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound state; existing examples swap standard Bell pairs or qutrit pairs, but none exploit a bound-state encoding to boost heralding.\n\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a teleportation network (entanglement swapping) with post-selection\u2014Pytheus can design such linear-optical networks.  \n    \u2022 The bound-state encoding is abstract: we simply treat two physical modes at Alice (and Bob) as one logical qubit living in a two-dimensional symmetric subspace.  \n    \u2022 We only require probabilistic pair sources and single-photon emitters, plus heralding detectors\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n    \u2022 Enhanced absorption is tested by comparing the heralding rate of this network vs. a standard teleportation network.  \n    \u2022 This protocol naturally generalizes to higher dimensions or longer chains of teleportation nodes.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound\u2010State Qubit Teleportation with Enhanced Heralding\n\nDescription:\nWe encode a logical qubit into two photonic modes at Alice and Bob by restricting to the symmetric two\u2010photon subspace (\u201cbound state\u201d protected by mode\u2010exchange symmetry), which enhances the coupling (absorption) into detectors. We then teleport this bound\u2010state\u2013encoded qubit from Alice to Bob via a central node Charlie using entanglement swapping. By comparing the heralding statistics to a standard teleporter, we directly observe \u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d due to the symmetry\u2010protected bound\u2010state encoding. The network can be generalized to longer chains or higher\u2010dimensional bound\u2010state encodings.\n\nVisualization:\n\u2022 Alice\u2019s logical qubit: two modes A\u2081, A\u2082, with unknown state \u2223\u03c8\u27e9 in the symmetric subspace Span{\u222301\u27e9+\u222310\u27e9, \u222300\u27e9, \u222311\u27e9\u2026 restricted to two\u2010dim logical basis}.  \n\u2022 Two SPDC sources produce Bell\u2010pairs: one between modes B\u2081\u2013C\u2081, one between modes B\u2082\u2013C\u2082.

Constructive interference in that protected subspace leads to an enhanced probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) of successful heralding when performing entanglement swapping.\n 2) Teleportation of a qubit encoded in a symmetry-protected two-mode bound subspace via a four-mode bound-state Bell analyzer, comparing its heralding rate to standard dual-rail teleportation.\n 3) A two-link repeater chain in which each link employs a symmetry-protected bound-state swap, demonstrating cumulative absorption enhancement over sequential swaps.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Option #1 is novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has used a multiport, symmetry-protected bound-state projector as the core of an entanglement-swap. Pytheus can optimize a three-port linear-optical network plus ancilla detectors to implement any desired projection. \n 2) Option #2 reduces to a teleportation variant\u2014less network-primitive novelty.\n 3) Option #3 is interesting but resource-heavy and complex for a first demonstration.\n\nStep 3: Choose Option #1.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it promotes a genuine symmetry-protected bound-state eigenmode\u2014realized by a C\u2083-symmetric multiport\u2014as the measurement primitive in entanglement swapping.

No previous Pytheus example has realized this kind of projector or used it to boost swap success.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:\n \u2022 It uses two SPDC pair sources (modes 0\u20131 and 2\u20133) and linear optics only.\n \u2022 The core is a 3-input, 3-output interferometer (the bound-state filter) plus number-resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.\n \u2022 The bound-state appears purely as an abstract two-photon subspace of the three-mode multiport; Pytheus doesn\u2019t need physical encoding details.\n \u2022 No dynamic feedback, cavities or nonlinear media are required\u2014only probabilistic sources, beam splitters, phase shifters and detectors.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Filtered Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We begin with two independent SPDC sources creating Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). Alice holds mode 0, Bob holds mode 3. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1 and 2 are fed into a C\u2083-symmetric three-port linear-optical interferometer whose design is optimized by Pytheus. This interferometer has one special two-photon eigenmode\u2014a \u201cbound state\u201d\u2014protected by its three-fold rotational symmetry. When the incoming photons from modes 1 and 2 occupy that bound subspace, interference directs them with anomalously high probability into two heralding detectors. A click pattern on Charlie\u2019s detectors simultaneously (a) entangles modes 0 and 3 (entanglement swap) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) versus a conventional two-port Bell-analyzer. By comparing both swap-fidelity and heralding rates against a reference linear-optical swap, one directly measures the absorption enhancement due to the symmetry-protected bound state. This bound-state swap module naturally generalizes to chains of nodes for repeaters or to higher-mode cyclic symmetries (C\u2084, C\u2085, \u2026).\n\nconfig:\n{\n  description: \"Entanglement swap via a symmetry\u2010protected C\u2083 bound\u2010state filter\",\n  foldername: \"BoundStateSwap_C3\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 25,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 2,                         # two herald detectors at Charlie\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: False,\n  safe_hist: True,\n  samples: 15,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],        # post\u2010selected Bell on modes 0 and 3\n  in_nodes: [],\n  out_nodes: [0,3],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  heralding_out: [1,2],               # Charlie\u2019s detectors\n  single_emitters: [],                # two SPDC pair sources only\n  removed_connections: [],            # sources only link (0,1) and (2,3)\n  number_resolving: True,\n  anc_detectors: [1,2],\n}\n\nThis network leverages Pytheus\u2019s ability to find the optimal linear-optical three-port implementing the non-trivial bound\u2010state projector, inserted as the swap measurement.

This bound state resonantly concentrates amplitude into heralding detectors, boosting swap success (\u201cabsorption\u201d).\n    2) Single-step entanglement purification via a cyclic-symmetry bound-state projector: two noisy Bell pairs are distilled by a three-port filter that only passes the cyclically symmetric two-photon bound mode, enhancing herald probability over standard distillation.\n    3) A two-link repeater chain where each link employs a topology-induced bound-state filter to sequentially swap entanglement with cumulative absorption enhancement.\n  Step 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n    1) Option 1 is novel: no existing Pytheus example uses a genuine three-photon bound-state resonance as the swap measurement primitive. Pytheus can design the required multiport and heralding detectors with SPDC and single-photon sources.\n    2) Option 2 is similar to prior symmetric-subspace filters; less network-primitive novelty.\n    3) Option 3 is scalable but too large for a first demonstration.\n  Step 3: Choose option 1.\n  Step 4: Novelty: embedding a Feshbach-type three-photon bound-state resonance into entanglement swapping yields a fundamentally new, non-Hermitian effective measurement that boosts heralding beyond any linear-optical Bell analyzer.\n  Step 5: Feasibility: uses only two SPDC sources, one single-photon emitter, linear optics, and number-resolving detectors\u2014entirely within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities. The bound state is an abstract three-photon eigenmode of the multiport, so no physical encoding details are needed.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExperiment Title: Three-Photon Bound-State\u2013Assisted Entanglement Swapping\n\nexplanation:\n  We start with two SPDC pair sources producing Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3). A single-photon emitter injects an ancilla photon into mode 4. At Charlie\u2019s node, modes 1, 2, and 4 interfere in a Pytheus-optimized multiport engineered to host a Feshbach-type three-photon bound state\u2014an eigenmode sharply localized by destructive interference with the \u201cscattering\u201d continuum. When the three photons collectively occupy that bound mode, they almost deterministically exit into two heralding detectors monitoring the bound-state outputs. A coincident click pattern both (a) swaps entanglement between modes 0 and 3 (leaving them in a Bell state) and (b) exhibits an enhanced heralding probability (\u201cenhanced light absorption\u201d) compared to a standard two-photon Bell analyzer. By benchmarking success rate and swap fidelity against the reference protocol, one directly quantifies the absorption enhancement imparted by the symmetry-protected bound state.

Concretely:\n   1) Two SPDC sources emit Bell pairs on modes (A\u2081,C\u2081) and (A\u2082,C\u2082). Alice holds A\u2081,A\u2082; Charlie receives C\u2081,C\u2082.  \n   2) An ancilla single photon is injected into mode X via a single-photon emitter.  \n   3) At Charlie\u2019s station, modes C\u2081,C\u2082 and X are mixed in a Pytheus-designed linear-optical network (the bound-state scissor), whose click pattern on two herald detectors H\u2081,H\u2082 enacts the non-unitary map  \n        M_g \u221d g\u00b7P_sym  (P_sym projects onto Span{|01\u27e9+|10\u27e9})  \n      thereby **amplifying** the bound-state amplitude by gain g>1 and discarding the orthogonal subspace.  \n   4) Conditioned on an H\u2081\u2013H\u2082 click, the two amplified ancilla modes then enter a second Pytheus-designed Bell analyzer with one half of an SPDC pair on modes (B,C\u2083). A click on its herald detectors swaps the purified, amplified bound-state qubit onto Bob\u2019s mode B.  \n   5) We compare teleportation fidelity and overall heralding probability (\u201cabsorption\u201d) against a reference network without the scissor.
