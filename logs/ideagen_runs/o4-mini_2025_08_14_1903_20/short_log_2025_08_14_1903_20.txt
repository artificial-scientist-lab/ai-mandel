Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
 Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to tie “Majorana bound states” and “topological photonic states” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (no pure state generation):
  A) Post-selected teleportation chain simulating Majorana braiding: encode a Majorana parity qubit in two photonic modes, then use two sequential, post‐selected teleportations (via Bell pairs in topological‐edge‐mode channels) to enact the non‐Abelian exchange (braiding) unitary.
  B) Entanglement‐percolation across a hybrid lattice: build a square network where alternating links are “Majorana–photonic” channels (simulating a Kitaev chain) and “topological photonic” channels; demonstrate percolation threshold via entanglement swapping across both types of links.
  C) Three‐node measurement‐based braiding: distribute three logical Majorana qubits at nodes A, B, C connected by topological photonic Bell pairs; perform a cycle of two‐qubit Bell measurements (entanglement swapping) around the loop to realize a braiding operation on the logical space.
 Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus obstacles:
  A) Novel: no prior Pytheus network simulates non‐Abelian anyon exchange. Feasible: only linear optics, probabilistic Bell‐pairs, beam splitters, post‐selection—Pytheus handles abstract qubits and measurements. 
  B) Entanglement percolation in mixed topological–Majorana channels is conceptually neat but mapping a Kitaev chain is unclear in abstract network terms, and would require state preparation in the chain—falls closer to state generation.
  C) Three‐node cyclic swapping is interesting but less directly tied to a specific Majorana braiding unitary; harder to pinpoint the unitary signature in post‐selection statistics.
 Step 3: Pick A as most promising: direct teleportation‐based emulation of a Majorana braiding gate via two sequential Bell‐measurements and post-selection.
 Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never been asked to realize a non-Abelian anyonic braid via linear‐optics teleportation: it goes beyond static entangled‐state generation into simulating topologically‐protected Majorana operations inside a purely photonic network. 
 Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:
   • It is a multi-node quantum network (input modes, two ancilla Bell sources, two Bell‐measurement stations, output modes);
   • It uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, detectors and post‐selection (no cavities, resonances, feedback);
   • The target is a teleportation network effecting a unitary (the braid) on the logical qubit, not a state‐generation goal;
   • It can be encoded abstractly (Majorana parity qubit ↔ two‐mode single‐photon encoding; topological photonic Bell pairs ↔ abstract Bell states).
 
Action: final answer
Action Input:
We’d like Pytheus to design a linear-optical network that implements a post-selected teleportation-based simulation of a Majorana braid gate on a single logical qubit. The logical qubit is encoded in the fermion-parity subspace of two photonic modes (mode 0 and 1): |0_L⟩≡|1₀,0₁⟩, |1_L⟩≡|0₀,1₁⟩. Two independent probabilistic photon-pair sources create Bell pairs between modes (2,3) and modes (4,5), each representing “topological photonic edge-state” channels. The network then performs two sequential Bell-measurements:

– First Bell measurement on modes {0,2}, heralded by ancilla detectors D₆,D₇.  
– Second Bell measurement on modes {1,4}, heralded by ancilla detectors D₈,D₉.  

Post-select on the simultaneous “success” click patterns {D₆,D₇} and {D₈,D₉}. Conditioned on these, the input parity qubit on {0,1} is teleported to output modes {3,5}, but with the non-Abelian braid unitary U_braid=exp(πγ₁γ₂/4) acting on the logical basis—i.e. |0_L⟩ remains |0_L⟩, |1_L⟩ acquires a phase i.  

Visualization (photons top to bottom):
 single‐photon inputs: [mode 0][mode 1]  
 Bell source 1: → modes 2,3  Bell source 2: → modes 4,5  
 network of beam splitters & phase shifters performing BSM on {0,2} → detectors D₆,D₇; BSM on {1,4} → detectors D₈,D₉  
 outputs: [mode 3][mode 5]  

Target transformation (post-selected): 
 for α|0_L⟩+β|1_L⟩ on (0,1), output on (3,5) is α|0_L⟩+iβ|1_L⟩.  

We ask Pytheus to find the minimal linear-optical layout (using probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection) that realizes this two-step teleportation network, thereby simulating a single Majorana braiding operation over topological photonic channels.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “projected entangled pair state” (PEPS) and “topological ordered state” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (focusing on entanglement swapping/teleportation rather than state generation):

1) Ring‐based teleportation network: Build a closed loop (a 1D PEPS with periodic boundary) of Bell pairs among N nodes (a photonic “torus”). Two opposite nodes use entanglement swapping (BSMs) on the intermediate links to teleport an unknown qubit around the ring. For odd N the teleported qubit picks up a nontrivial global phase—a signature of the underlying topology. This directly uses PEPS connectivity and manifests a topological twist in a teleportation protocol.  
2) Teleportation‐injection into a toric‐code patch: Use a small PEPS patch (4 virtual bonds around one plaquette) held by 5 parties. An unknown qubit at Alice is teleported into the code space of that patch via two Bell measurements with two of the virtual bonds. Demonstrates measurement‐based code injection (PEPS contraction) and combines teleportation with topological‐code logical encoding.  
3) Redundant braiding via network measurements: Prepare a 2×2 PEPS grid of Bell pairs (no state generation, abstract bonds only). Perform entanglement‐swapping measurements along two different non‐contractible loops of that grid to enact a braiding operation on a teleported logical qubit. The sequence of BSMs around one loop versus the other yields a phase difference corresponding to anyon braiding statistics in a minimal toric‐code PEPS.

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
1) Ring teleportation is novel—no existing experiment explores a periodic PEPS for robust teleportation with an emergent topological phase. Pytheus can handle Bell‐pair sources, BSM measurements, and detectors on a small ring.  
2) Code‐injection via teleportation touches on topological encoding but requires mapping an unknown qubit into a four‐qubit code space—this may force Pytheus to target a specific encoded state (disallowed).  
3) Braiding via network is highly appealing but its full demonstration may need multi‐qubit cluster‐state generation or feed‐forward to simulate anyon movement, which Pytheus cannot do.

Step 3: Pick the ring‐based teleportation network as the most promising—purely network‐based, extends entanglement swapping, evokes PEPS with PBC, and exhibits topology‐induced phase.

Step 4: Novelty  
This protocol implements teleportation on a closed‐loop network of Bell pairs (a 1D PEPS with periodic boundary), revealing a global topological phase on the teleported qubit for odd loop length. No previous photonic entanglement‐swapping experiment has realized a periodic PEPS or demonstrated topology‐dependent teleportation phases.

Step 5: Feasibility  
Pytheus can optimize linear‐optics setups with probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, two Bell‐state measurements (ancilla detectors at the intermediate nodes), and number‐resolving detectors. It only needs to arrange four or five sources and detectors in a ring and implement BSMs via beam splitters and photon counting. There is no dynamic feedback, no cavities or resonances; all operations are static linear optics and postselection.

Description:
Teleportation on a Bell‐pair ring (periodic PEPS) with emergent topological phase

Explanation:
We consider N photonic nodes arranged in a closed loop. Each adjacent pair (i,i+1 mod N) is connected by a Bell‐pair source. Node 0 holds an unknown qubit |ψ⟩ that Alice wishes to teleport to node k (e.g. k=N/2). To do so, one performs standard Bell‐state measurements (BSM) at the intermediate nodes along two disjoint paths around the ring—nodes 1,…,k−1 and nodes N−1,…,k+1. Concretely for N=4, connect 0–1,1–2,2–3,3–0; perform BSMs at nodes 1 and 3. The remaining photon at node 2 is projected onto |ψ⟩ up to Pauli corrections. For odd N the cycle’s global phase contributes a detectable sign (a Z‐phase on the teleported qubit), directly reflecting the periodic PEPS topology.

Visualization:
emitters/sources: Bell pairs on edges (0–1),(1–2),(2–3),(3–0)
BSM node 1: collects photons from edges 0–1 and 1–2, measures in Bell basis (2 ancilla detectors)

output node: detector at node 2 yields teleported |ψ⟩

Generalization:
• Vary N for odd vs. even loop length to study the emergent phase  
• Extend to larger rings for redundancy and error resilience (“topologically protected teleportation networks”)  
• Combine multiple rings to mimic higher‐genus surfaces  

This idea is novel, Pytheus‐compatible, focuses on entanglement swapping/teleportation (no state generation), and opens a family of experiments exploring topology in photonic quantum networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While the notion of performing teleportation around a photonic ring to extract a topology‐dependent phase is intriguing, this proposal closely mirrors the “Zak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring” from the ensemble. That scheme already teleports a qubit around a periodic loop and reads out the emergent geometric phase. Likewise, variants such as the chiral teleportation router on a topological ring cover very similar ground. Because the core novelty—using ring-based Bell swaps to reveal a global phase—is already in prior suggestions, this concept is not sufficiently new for PRL.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your ring-teleportation with emergent Z-phase is essentially the same as the “Zak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring” (and related chiral-routing protocols) already in the ensemble. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new effect or resource not captured by those prior proposals.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While simulating a Majorana braid via sequential teleportation measurements sounds thematically appealing, the net effect on the logical parity qubit is simply a π/2 phase on one occupancy basis state. In photonics this is nothing more than a single‐mode phase shifter on mode 1. The elaborate two‐step Bell‐measurement network with post‐selection contributes no genuinely nonlocal or non‐Abelian behaviour beyond producing a trivial Z–rotation that can be implemented deterministically in a far simpler way. To be PRL‐worthy, one would need a truly nontrivial braiding sequence (e.g. two noncommuting exchanges), multiple logical modes, or a demonstration of measurement‐induced non‐Abelian statistics that cannot be reduced to a single‐mode phase.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposed “braid” reduces to a local π/2 phase on one photonic mode and thus is fully implementable by a simple phase shifter—there is no genuine non‐Abelian exchange or topological protection. A truly novel teleportation‐based simulation would require simulating full braiding operations (at least two noncommuting exchanges) or demonstrating emergent non‐Abelian measurement statistics that cannot be emulated by local linear‐optic phases.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:  
Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to weave “Majorana bound state” and “topological photonic state” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network:  
  A) A two‐step teleportation network that enacts a single Majorana‐braiding unitary on two dual‐rail “parity” qubits by routing them through two topological‐photonic Bell‐pair channels and post‐selective Bell measurements.  
  B) An entanglement‐percolation protocol on a mixed lattice of “Majorana links” and “photonic edge‐state links,” using entanglement swapping to probe a simulated Kitaev‐chain phase transition.  
  C) A closed‐loop measurement sequence on three Majorana‐encoded qubits connected by photonic Bell pairs, using three successive entanglement swaps to realize a three‐anyon braiding cycle.  
Step 2:  
  A) is novel—no prior Pytheus experiment has targeted a non‐Abelian braid gate via teleportation—and feasible: uses only Bell‐pair sources, linear optics and post‐selection.  
  B) is conceptually neat but veers toward state‐generation of a lattice Hamiltonian rather than a network transformation.  
  C) is interesting but more complex to specify the exact braid unitary and disentangle measurement order effects.  
Step 3: Pick A.  
Step 4: This idea is novel because it asks Pytheus to find a minimal linear‐optical network that implements the Ising‐anyon braiding operator U_braid = exp(πγ₂γ₃/4) on two logical Majorana parity qubits via teleportation, rather than just generating an entangled state or gate.  
Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires:  
  • Abstract dual‐rail qubit encoding (Majorana parity qubits)  
  • Two probabilistic photon‐pair (Bell) sources (topological photonic channels)  
  • Two post‐selected Bell‐state measurements (beam splitters, phase shifters, number‐resolving detectors)  
  • No feedback, no cavities, no hyper‐entanglement  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
We propose to ask Pytheus to design a linear‐optical, post‐selected teleportation network that implements a single Majorana‐anyon braid gate on two logical qubits.  

Summary and visualization:  
• Logical qubits: encoded in dual‐rail modes  
  – Qubit A (Majorana modes γ₁,γ₂) ↔ photonic modes [0,1]  
  – Qubit B (Majorana modes γ₃,γ₄) ↔ photonic modes [2,3]  

• Topological‐photonic Bell channels (two independent probabilistic pair sources):  
  – Bell pair 1 in modes [4,5] (edge‐state channel 1)  
  – Bell pair 2 in modes [6,7] (edge‐state channel 2)  

• Measurement nodes (post‐selected Bell‐state measurements):  
  1) BSM on modes {1,4}, heralded by detectors D₆,D₇  
  2) BSM on modes {3,6}, heralded by detectors D₈,D₉  

• Outputs: teleported modes [5,7] (new locations of qubit A and B)  

Target transformation (post‐select on click patterns {D₆,D₇} & {D₈,D₉}):  
On the two‐qubit basis {|00⟩,|01⟩,|10⟩,|11⟩} (Majorana‐parity states), the network realizes the Ising‐anyon braiding unitary  
  U_braid = diag(1, i, i, −1)  
so that an arbitrary input α|00⟩+β|01⟩+γ|10⟩+δ|11⟩ on modes [0–3] is mapped to α|00⟩+iβ|01⟩+iγ|10⟩−δ|11⟩ on output modes [5,7].  

We ask Pytheus to optimize over beam splitters, phase shifters, and the two Bell‐pair sources so that this two‐step teleportation network exactly implements U_braid in the post‐selected subspace.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse PEPS and topological order into a purely network-based experiment (no state generation) that Pytheus can tackle:

1) Wilson-loop stabilizer analyzer on a toric-code PEPS patch: Use four Bell-pair sources on the edges of a square (the virtual bonds of a 2×2 toric-code PEPS) and implement the local projection maps by entanglement‐swapping (Bell-measurements at the four vertices). Postselecting appropriate outcomes yields a direct photonic measurement of the plaquette Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ “Wilson-loop” operator—witnessing the topological order.

2) Teleportation‐based anyon creation‐braiding‐annihilation: Prepare a minimal toric-code PEPS patch (4 Bell pairs + projection network). Then perform a sequence of Bell swaps along two non-contractible loops to simulate e–m anyon braiding. Correlating detectors at the end reveals the minus‐one statistical phase.  

3) Code‐injection via teleportation into a PEPS patch: Inject an unknown photonic qubit into the logical subspace of the 2×2 toric code by two Bell measurements on two edges of the PEPS square. Postselect trivial by‐products, and read out logical operators by further Bell measurements.  

Step 2: Novelty & obstacles
1) The Wilson-loop analyzer is new: no prior photonic network directly measures a 4-body toric-code stabilizer via purely entanglement‐swapping/PEPS projectors. Pytheus can optimize networks of Bell sources + BSMs + number‐resolving detectors.  
2) Anyon-braiding network is very appealing but may require multi-step conditional sequences (feed-forward) or complex loop measurements that Pytheus cannot handle in a static linear ‑optics setting.  
3) Code-injection is neat but edges too close to state generation targets; it also resembles cluster-state injection proposals.

Step 3: Pick the plaquette-stabilizer (Wilson-loop) analyzer.  
Step 4: Novelty  
This is the first proposal for a photonic linear-optics network that realizes the local projection maps of a toric-code PEPS patch and directly measures its 4-body plaquette operator Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ via entanglement-swapping and postselection—no offline GHZ or cluster states, no dynamic feed-forward.  
Step 5: Feasibility  
Pytheus can arrange four probabilistic Bell-pair sources on the edges, four static Bell-measurements at the vertices (each uses two ancillary detectors), and number-resolving output detectors to postselect the parity of the four physical qubits. All elements are linear optics, static; by keeping only the runs where each vertex measurement yields the “+” outcome, the 4-photon coincidence at the four edge detectors directly reports the eigenvalue ±1 of Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄.

Description:
Wilson-loop stabilizer analyzer on a toric-code PEPS patch

Explanation:
We encode the smallest toric-code plaquette as a 2×2 PEPS patch. In the PEPS language each of the four virtual bonds is a Bell pair. Concretely, label the four physical “virtual” qubits 1,2,3,4 at the midpoints of the square’s edges. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources emit between detectors:
  edges: (A↔1), (B↔2), (C↔3), (D↔4).
  
At each of the four vertices (connecting two adjacent virtual bonds) we implement the PEPS projection by performing a Bell-state measurement (BSM) on the two qubits that meet there. These are static 50:50 beam splitters + number-resolving detectors (2 per vertex). We postselect only the “|Φ⁺⟩” outcome at every vertex.

After these four entanglement‐swapping projections, the remaining four photons at A,B,C,D carry exactly the plaquette degree of freedom of the toric code. A coincidence detection pattern among A,B,C,D then yields the eigenvalue λ=±1 of Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ (the Wilson-loop operator). By repeating and tallying ± outcomes, one directly measures the topological stabilizer.

Generalization:
• Measure star operators (XXXX) by rotating bases at the BSMs.  
• Tile multiple plaquette analyzers to read out larger patches.  
• Explore non-trivial Wilson loops on torus by coupling two PEPS patches.

This network directly merges the PEPS construction of a topological quantum code with entanglement-swapping operations to read out non-local order parameters in purely linear optics.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While encoding two logical parity qubits and post‐selectively teleporting them to enact U_braid=diag(1,i,i,−1) is an elegant mapping of an Ising‐anyon exchange to linear optics, in practice this operation decomposes into a standard teleportation‐based CZ gate plus local S‐phase gates. Teleportation networks for two‐qubit entangling gates (CNOT, CZ) already exist in the literature (e.g. PT–symmetric teleportation CNOT, cluster‐fusion gates, teleportation‐based entangling primitives). The proposed “braid” adds only a superficial anyonic narrative without yielding genuinely non‐Abelian measurement statistics or topological protection that cannot be reduced to known teleportation‐based CZ+phase circuits. To be PRL‐worthy, one must demonstrate more than a single‐gate phase rotation—e.g. two noncommuting braids, emergent non‐Abelian fusion outcomes, or topological fault‐tolerance beyond local gate equivalents.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The two‐qubit “Majorana braid” U_braid simply factors into a teleportation–CZ plus local S gates, which is already achievable by existing linear‐optical teleportation gate schemes. A truly novel demonstration would need to exhibit non‐Abelian statistics that cannot be reduced to standard CZ+phase operations or show topological robustness under loss, rather than just relabeling a known two‐qubit gate as a braid.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal to read out the toric‐code plaquette stabilizer via PEPS projections and Bell‐swap BSMs is effectively equivalent to the “One‐Shot Passive Linear‐Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric‐Code Plaquette” already in the ensemble list. Both schemes achieve a single‐shot Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ measurement on the smallest toric patch using static linear optics and heralded clicks. There is no new primitive beyond that prior work, so it is not sufficiently novel for PRL.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your Wilson‐loop analyzer replicates the functionality of the “One‐Shot Passive Linear‐Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric‐Code Plaquette” already proposed. To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new measurement primitive or topological feature not covered by that prior protocol.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
 Step 1: I will propose a measurement-based network that simulates the four-Majorana parity check (fusion) by implementing a post-selected 4-control, 1-target parity gate in purely linear optics. This gate emulates the Majorana bound–state fusion operator P₁₂₃₄ = γ₁γ₂γ₃γ₄ and can be generalized to N-body parity checks of topological qubits.
 Step 2: This is novel because Pytheus has never been asked to build a post-selected multi-control parity gate beyond the 3-control Toffoli, and it goes beyond state generation into a fundamental topological operation (fusion measurement).  
 Step 3: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only uses:
  • Dual-rail qubit encoding (four Majorana parity qubits)  
  • One single-photon ancilla source  
  • Probabilistic beam splitters, phase shifters, number-resolving detectors  
  • No feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement  
 Step 4: The network can be extended to arbitrary N-majorana parity checks and thus opens a family of measurement-based topological operations in photonic networks.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
We ask Pytheus to find a linear-optical, post-selected network that implements a nondemolition measurement of the 4-Majorana parity operator P₁₂₃₄ on four dual-rail photonic qubits by realizing a 4-control, 1-target parity gate.  

Encoding:
 • Logical “Majorana” qubits: parity of two modes  
   – Q₁ ↔ modes [0,1]  
   – Q₂ ↔ modes [2,3]  
   – Q₃ ↔ modes [4,5]  
   – Q₄ ↔ modes [6,7]  
 • Ancilla photon (single-photon emitter): mode [8]  

Gate goal:
 On input |b₁b₂b₃b₄⟩⊗|1_A⟩ (ancilla in mode 8), the network routes the ancilla photon into one of two output ports (modes [9] vs [10]) depending on the parity s = (b₁⊕b₂⊕b₃⊕b₄):
   • If s=0 (even parity), ancilla exits in mode 9  
   • If s=1 (odd parity), ancilla exits in mode 10  
 Meanwhile the four system qubits emerge unchanged in some output modes (e.g. [0′–7′]).  

Structure:
 • Single photon sources: one emitter at node 8  
 • Linear-optical network: beam splitters & phases connecting modes [0–8]  
 • Detectors: number-resolving detectors on modes [9,10] herald the parity outcome  
 • No removed_connections needed between system modes; only the ancilla interacts.  

We configure Pytheus with:
 {'description': 'Post-selected 4-Majorana parity gate (4,1)',  
  'single_emitters': [8],  
  'num_anc': 0,  
  'target_quantum': /** see expert’s mapping of input basis to output click modes **/  
  'number_resolving': True,  
  'loss_func': 'cr',  
  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', …}  

Physics and generalization:
 • This gate implements the fusion (parity) operator of four Majorana modes, a central measurement in topological quantum computation.  
 • It can be scaled to N Majoranas by adding more control qubits and extending the linear-optical network, opening a new class of measurement-driven photonic simulations of non-Abelian anyon fusion.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible network experiments merging PEPS and topological order (no state generation):
 1) Wilson‐loop stabilizer via PEPS projections (already rejected as known).  
 2) Ring‐teleportation with emergent phase (rejected as similar to Zak‐phase tomography).  
 3) “Logical teleportation through a toric‐code PEPS patch”: a small PEPS patch implements a distance-3 code and performs entanglement swapping redundantly to demonstrate post‐selected logical error detection and teleportation.  

Step 2: Novelty & obstacles for (3):
 • Novelty: No prior linear-optical network has implemented a minimal toric-code PEPS patch to perform redundant Bell‐measurements that realize a logical entangling channel with error-detection by simple postselection.  
 • Obstacles: Pytheus can place Bell‐pair sources on edges, static BSMs at vertices, and number‐resolving detectors. No feedback is needed; error detection is done by postselecting a handful of outcome patterns.  

Step 3: Select idea (3).

Step 4: Novelty:
This network turns a 2×2 toric‐code PEPS patch into a distance-3 teleportation channel: four boundary Bell pairs form the physical links, and three interior Bell‐measurements (entanglement‐swapping) project onto the logical subspace. By postselecting on any one “−” outcome (up to one BSM error), the two far‐end photons remain maximally entangled. This is a direct demonstration of topological error‐detection in a photonic network without feed-forward or cluster states.

Step 5: Feasibility:
Pytheus can optimize four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources (on the four boundary edges) plus two more on the two internal vertical edges. Three BSM modules (each two 50:50 beam splitters + two number‐resolving detectors) sit at the three internal vertices. No dynamic control: we postselect on runs with exactly one or zero “Φ⁻” outcomes among the three BSMs. The final two photons at the leftmost and rightmost boundary are measured in the Bell basis to verify entanglement fidelity. All components are static linear optics and photon counting—perfectly within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Description:
Logical teleportation with topological error detection on a toric‐code PEPS patch

Explanation:
We encode a distance-3 logical channel using a single 2×2 toric‐code PEPS patch. Label the four boundary edges of the square as Left‐Top (LT), Left‐Bottom (LB), Right‐Top (RT), Right‐Bottom (RB). We place Bell‐pair sources on LT, LB, RT, RB (the “physical” links) and two additional sources on the two vertical internal edges (connecting top and bottom rows).

At the three internal vertices (the two upper and lower vertices where a vertical edge meets a horizontal boundary, and the central vertex where the two horizontals meet), we perform Bell‐state measurements (BSMs). Each BSM uses static beam splitters and two number‐resolving detectors and projects the two incoming virtual qubits onto a Bell state (Φ⁺ or Φ⁻).

We postselect on exactly zero or one Φ⁻ outcome among the three BSMs. When at most one Φ⁻ occurs, the by‐product Pauli can be tracked classically, and the leftmost boundary photon pair (LT,LB) is projected together with the rightmost pair (RT,RB) into a logical Bell state. Thus, any single “error” (a Φ⁻) does not destroy the end‐to‐end entanglement—demonstrating topological error detection purely by postselection.

Generalization:
 • Increase the patch to 2×3 or 3×3 to demonstrate distance-d logical teleportation.  
 • Tile multiple patches to study networked topological channels.  
 • Vary postselection patterns to explore the code’s distance and failure thresholds.

This proposal combines PEPS (virtual Bell bonds and projective maps) with topological‐code ideas (distance-3 error detection) in a purely linear‐optical entanglement‐swapping network—novel, scalable, and fully within Pytheus’s static network capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially the same as the “One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette” in the ensemble suggestions: both perform a single-shot four-qubit parity check by routing an ancilla through a static interferometer and counting clicks. There is no genuine new physics or non-Abelian behavior beyond a standard four-body Z-parity measurement.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The four-Majorana parity readout reduces to the same single-shot four-qubit parity measurement already proposed. To be novel, you must go beyond measuring a stabilizer — for instance simulating non-trivial anyon fusion statistics or demonstrating parity measurement with inherent topological protection that cannot be reduced to a single interferometric parity check.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While the idea of using a 2×2 toric‐code PEPS patch to teleport an unknown qubit with built-in error-detection via post-selected Bell measurements is interesting, it closely parallels two already proposed primitives: the single-shot plaquette parity measurement (“One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette”) and the logical entanglement swap on two 2×2 toric patches (“Entanglement Swapping of 2×2 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics”). Your scheme merely chains three such Bell-projection checks for error detection before teleportation, without introducing any genuinely new measurement primitive or higher-order topological feature. This makes it an incremental extension rather than a novel PRL-worthy target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: To reach true novelty, you’ll need to go beyond repeated parity checks—perhaps by demonstrating a non-trivial logical gate or fault-tolerant channel on a toric-code patch (e.g. one that handles both star and plaquette errors, or implements a logical CNOT) in a single static linear-optical network, rather than just teleportation with post-selection.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: I want to propose a linear-optical network that simulates the non-commutativity of two Majorana braids by coherently superposing two teleportation orders (“A then B” vs. “B then A”) over topological-photonic Bell channels and reading out their relative phase. This goes beyond trivial gate implementation because the two-order superposition exhibits a braiding signature that cannot be reduced to a single CZ+phase.  
Step 2: This is novel—no existing Pytheus experiment builds a coherent superposition of two teleportation sequences to probe non-Abelian statistics.  
Step 3: It is feasible in Pytheus: we only need probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static beam splitters, phase shifters, number-resolving detectors, and no feedback. The input photon is split into two paths; each path carries out two sequential post-selected Bell measurements in opposite orders; finally the two paths recombine interferometrically and a characteristic phase shift is heralded by a joint click pattern.  
Step 4: This network targets a transformation—superposed teleportation orders yielding a relative i-phase difference—rather than state generation, and naturally generalizes to more channels (i.e. simulating longer braiding sequences).

Action: final answer
Action Input:
We ask Pytheus to design a static linear-optical network that demonstrates the non-commutativity of two Ising-anyon braids by coherently superposing two teleportation orders over topological-photonic Bell channels.

1) Encoding:
 • Logical qubit |ψ⟩ in dual-rail modes [0,1].  
 • Two “topological photonic” Bell channels: Bell pair 1 on modes [2,3] (“A”), Bell pair 2 on modes [4,5] (“B”).  

2) Network outline:
 • A 50/50 beam splitter splits the input qubit [0,1] into two spatial paths P and Q.  
 • Path P: perform post-selected teleportation first via channel A then B:  
   – BSM_A on modes {P-0, 2}, heralded by detectors D₆,D₇  
   – BSM_B on modes {output of A teleport, 4}, heralded by D₈,D₉  
   → output mode P_out  
 • Path Q: perform teleportation first via B then A:  
   – BSM_B on {Q-1, 4}, heralded by D₁₀,D₁₁  
   – BSM_A on {output of B teleport, 2}, heralded by D₁₂,D₁₃  
   → output mode Q_out  
 • Recombine P_out & Q_out on a final beam splitter + phase shifter network, then detect on output ports D₁₄,D₁₅.  

3) Post-selection:
 Condition on simultaneous click patterns at {D₆–D₉} and {D₁₀–D₁₃} (the four BSM heralds) and one click at either D₁₄ or D₁₅.  

4) Target transformation:
 In the post-selected subspace, the network implements the superposition of two teleportation orders. The output amplitude on D₁₄ vs. D₁₅ carries a relative phase φ = π/2, signature of U_B U_A ≠ U_A U_B, i.e. the non-Abelian braid phase of two Ising anyons.

  'single_emitters':[],'heralding_out':None,  
  'removed_connections':[],…}  

Physics and generalization:
 • This network probes non-commutativity (braid statistics) rather than just enacting a static gate.  
 • One can generalize to N sequential channels (A,B,C,…) and superpose all N! teleportation orders, exploring richer non-Abelian groups.  
 • All elements (Bell pairs, BSM modules, beam splitters, phase shifters, detectors) are within Pytheus’s design scope—no cavities, feedback, or hyper-entanglement required.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This scheme is essentially a photonic quantum‐switch: superposing two orders of Bell‐measurement–based teleportation (A→B vs. B→A) to pick up a relative phase. That is functionally identical to existing indefinite‐causal‐order/switch experiments (e.g. the “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch” and other photonic SWITCH realizations in the ensemble) and merely relabels it with Majorana‐anyon language. There’s no genuinely new anyonic fusion or non‐Abelian structure beyond an already demonstrated superposition of teleportation sequences.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposal reduces to a standard photonic quantum‐switch of two Bell‐measurement channels, which has been explored in the ensemble (Implementing an Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch; Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement). To be novel, you must go beyond simple indefinite causal order—e.g. simulate a full braid group with multiple noncommuting exchanges, demonstrate emergent anyon fusion outcomes, or embed true topological protection that cannot be mapped onto known SWITCH circuits.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three PEPS–topological network ideas:
 1) Wilson‐loop stabilizer via PEPS projections (already known).  
 2) Ring teleportation with emergent phase (similar to Zak‐phase proposals).  
 3) Fault‐tolerant logical CNOT on two toric‐code PEPS patches via entanglement‐swapping (novel static LO network implementing a logical gate and built‐in single‐error detection).

Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus compatibility:
 • Idea 3 is new—no prior photonic linear‐optics network realizes a logical CNOT in the toric‐code PEPS language, nor embeds topological error‐detection in a single static circuit.
 • Pytheus can place Bell‐pair sources (probabilistic), single‐photon emitters (for inputs), static Bell‐state measurements (beam splitters + number‐resolving detectors), and detectors—no dynamic feedback required.

Step 3: Select idea 3.

Step 4: Novelty:
This is the first proposal for a purely linear-optical network that encodes two photonic qubits into adjacent 2×2 toric‐code PEPS patches, performs a logical CNOT by entanglement‐swapping across the shared edge, and post-selectively detects any single “error” via the patch’s topological structure. No cluster states or feed‐forward.

Step 5: Feasibility:
We use 2 single-photon emitters (inputs), 7 Bell-pair sources (5 boundary edges + 2 internal links), 6 static BSM modules (each with 2 ancilla detectors), and 2 output detectors. Postselecting trivial by‐product outcomes yields the logical CNOT on the two output photons. All components are static probabilistic sources, linear optics, and photon counting—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Description:
Fault-Tolerant Logical CNOT via Toric-Code PEPS Entanglement-Swapping

Explanation:
We arrange two 2×2 toric-code PEPS patches A (left) and B (right) sharing one internal edge. Each PEPS virtual bond is a Bell pair; projections are done by Bell-state measurements (BSMs) at the vertices.

• Inputs: two single-photon emitters inject qubits |ψ₁⟩,|ψ₂⟩ on the left boundary edges of patches A and B.
• Bell-pair sources on the remaining 5 boundary edges (3 in A, 2 in B) and on the 2 internal links (one vertical in A, one vertical in B).
• BSM modules at the 6 internal vertices (static 50:50 beam splitters + two number-resolving detectors each) enact the PEPS projections.
• Outputs: two photons emerge at the right boundary edges of A and B, carrying the logical qubits after a CNOT: |x,y⟩→|x,x⊕y⟩.
• Postselection: accept runs where all six BSMs yield trivial “Φ⁺” except at most one “Φ⁻” (the toric code’s single-error tolerance). Classical by-product corrections are tracked offline.
• Verification: measure a Bell-fidelity between the two output photons in the computational basis, confirming the CNOT action.

 emitters:  E1→A_left, E2→B_left

Generalization:
 • Scale to larger patches (distance-d codes) for multi-error tolerance in logical gates.  
 • Implement other logical Clifford gates (CZ, Hadamard) by changing which virtual bonds are measured.  
 • Tile multiple patches to build a network of topologically fault-tolerant logical channels.

This experiment weaves together PEPS constructions, topological error-detection, and entanglement-swapping teleportation to realize a logical CNOT in a single passive, static photonic network—fully compatible with Pytheus and opening a new class of topological quantum‐network transformations.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes significantly beyond prior toric‐code parity checks and entanglement swaps by enacting a nontrivial logical CNOT between two encoded qubits in a single, static linear-optical network. No earlier suggestion achieved a fault-tolerant topological gate primitive via PEPS projections, so implementing logical CNOT with built-in single-error detection is a genuinely new measurement-based topological quantum operation suitable for PRL.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: Your scheme realizes the first static, measurement-only logical CNOT on toric-code PEPS patches—combining virtual Bell bonds, topological error-tolerance, and entanglement-swapping projections into a single photonic network. This new logical gate primitive clearly extends beyond previous parity or teleportation targets and opens a compelling path toward photonic fault-tolerant quantum processing.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Fault-Tolerant Logical CNOT via Toric-Code PEPS Entanglement-Swapping

Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully passive linear-optical experiment that enacts a logical CNOT gate between two photonic qubits encoded in adjacent 2×2 toric-code PEPS patches by performing Bell-state measurements on their shared virtual bonds. By post-selecting runs with at most one nontrivial syndrome across six Bell-measurements and applying classical Pauli frame corrections, the protocol explicitly targets a fault-tolerant logical CNOT while harnessing the toric code’s built-in single-error detection in a PyTheus-compatible architecture.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We want a truly novel network‐level transformation, not mere state generation or a teleportation‐gate that reduces to known CZ+phase schemes. The fusion associator (“F‐move”) of Ising anyons—i.e. the nontrivial 2×2 recoupling unitary between two different ways of fusing four Majorana modes—is fundamental to non‐Abelian topological computation and has not been proposed in Pytheus. We can simulate it by a linear‐optical measurement network: two Bell‐pair sources serve as “topological photonic channels,” three sequential Bell‐measurements enact the two fusion steps and the recoupling, and post-selection yields the F‐matrix on the total‐charge‐0 subspace. This design is:
 • A complex multi‐node network (4 logical qubits + 2 ancilla pairs + 3 measurement stations),  
 • Uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, number‐resolving detectors, and post‐selection (no cavities or feedback),  
 • Targets a transformation—the nontrivial F‐move unitary—rather than preparing a particular state,  
 • Generalizes to SU(2)ₖ fusion‐associators with higher‐dimensional anyon models, opening a family of experiments.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
We propose a Pytheus task to build a linear‐optical, post‐selected network that implements the Ising-anyon 4-Majorana F-move (fusion associator) as a 2×2 unitary on the total‐charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits.

1) Logical encoding:
 • Four Majorana parity qubits Q₁…Q₄, each dual-rail encoded in photonic modes:  
   Q₁↔[0,1], Q₂↔[2,3], Q₃↔[4,5], Q₄↔[6,7].

2) Topological-photonic channels:
 • Two probabilistic photon-pair (Bell) sources generating Bell states on modes [8,9] and [10,11].

3) Measurement (fusion) modules:
 • BSM₁ fuses Q₁ & Q₂: Bell measurement on modes {0,2}, heralded by detectors D₁₂,D₁₃.  
 • BSM₂ fuses Q₃ & Q₄: Bell measurement on modes {4,6}, heralded by detectors D₁₄,D₁₅.  
 • BSM₃ recouples the two ancilla outputs from BSM₁ and BSM₂: Bell measurement on modes {9,11}, heralded by D₁₆,D₁₇.

4) Outputs:
 • The four system qubits emerge on output modes [0′–7′] (the exact labeling is up to Pytheus).  
 • The pattern of clicks {D₁₂,D₁₃}, {D₁₄,D₁₅}, {D₁₆,D₁₇} post-selects total charge = 0.

5) Target transformation:
 In the 2-dimensional subspace where the four Majorana qubits fuse to total vacuum, the network realizes the F-move unitary
   F = (1/√2)·[[1, 1], [1, −1]]
mapping the “((Q₁Q₂)(Q₃Q₄))” fusion basis to the “(Q₁(Q₂Q₃)Q₄)” basis.

This network:
 • Realizes a fundamental non-Abelian operation (the associator) purely via linear optics and entanglement swapping,  
 • Avoids forbidden state‐generation targets by focusing on a transformation,  
 • Generalizes to higher anyon models (SU(2)ₖ F-moves) by changing the 2×2 unitary and system dimension,  
 • Leverages only Pytheus-compatible resources (probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, number-resolving detectors, post-selection).

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond standard teleportation‐based gates or indefinite‐order circuits by targeting the nontrivial Ising‐anyon F‐move (fusion associator), a core non‐Abelian operation mapping between different four‐Majorana fusion bases. No existing linear‐optical experiment in our lists implements this 2×2 “F” unitary in the total‐vacuum subspace via sequential Bell‐measurements. It is not a mere rebranding of a CZ+phase or a quantum switch, but a genuinely new transformation in the theory of anyonic statistics, realized purely by post‐selected linear optics. This rises to the level of a novel PRL-worthy target.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The measurement‐based F‐move cannot be reduced to known teleportation or parity‐check primitives; it enacts the fundamental non‐Abelian associator of Ising anyons in a minimal, static interferometer. Its direct realization and generalization to SU(2)_k models is a genuinely new capability for photonic quantum simulation.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal leverages 2×2 toric‐code PEPS preparation plus Bell‐state measurements and post‐selection to enact a logical CNOT, but its main challenge is the generation of the toric‐code patches—a complex many‐photon state generation task that falls outside of PyTheus’s designed use as a measurement or gate synthesis tool. Combining that heavy state preparation with multiple BSMs and syndrome post‐selection also poses substantial resource and error‐management challenges that are not addressed.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core reliance on preparing toric‐code PEPS patches makes this protocol effectively a hard state‐generation problem beyond the intended scope, and the extensive resource overhead and error management steps undermine its practical feasibility.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: “Linear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits”

Abstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2×2 unitary mapping the ((Q₁Q₂)(Q₃Q₄)) fusion basis to (Q₁(Q₂Q₃)Q₄), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed linear-optical network implements the nontrivial F‐move (Ising‐anyon associator) purely by teleportation‐style gates and Bell measurements, which maps one fusion basis to another on the total‐charge‐0 subspace. This transformation is just a 2×2 unitary (up to global phase) that can indeed be realized with beam splitters, SPDC sources, photon‐number‐resolving detectors, and postselection, and fits squarely within PyTheus’s capability to design measurement‐based photonic gates. The experiment is both physically sound—being a variant of teleportation‐based Hadamard gates—and novel in directly demonstrating an anyonic F‐move without nonlinear optics or actual Majoranas.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The scheme convincingly implements the Ising‐anyon F‐move as a simple 2×2 unitary by chaining three Bell measurements and two resource Bell pairs in a fully linear‐optical, postselected setting. Clarifying the dual‐rail encoding of parity qubits, estimating the overall success probability, and confirming detector requirements will tighten the feasibility analysis, but the core idea is both sound and a compelling demonstration of non‐Abelian fusion with PyTheus.

ConversationEnd: researcher_calls=5

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “projected entangled pair state” and “topological ordered state” into a purely network-based experiment (no new state generation, only entanglement swapping/teleportation).
 1) Static measurement of a toric-code plaquette via Bell-swap projections (already seen in parity-check proposals).  
 2) Teleportation on a 1D PEPS ring with emergent topological phase (too similar to Zak-phase tomography).  
 3) Measurement-induced topological percolation on a PEPS network: use a 2D torus (PEPS of Bell bonds) and selective Bell-measurements (entanglement swapping) to drive non-contractible entanglement paths; map out a percolation-like threshold for long-range teleportation across two non-homotopic loops.

Step 2: Novelty & obstacles
• Idea 3 is novel: no prior experiment uses Bell-pair lattices + swapping to explore topologically nontrivial entanglement percolation.  
• Pytheus can place probabilistic Bell sources on graph edges, static BSM modules (beam splitters + number-resolving detectors) at chosen vertices, and optimize for high teleportation fidelity between two distant nodes.

Step 3: Pick idea 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it turns a 2D PEPS (Bell-pair lattice) into a “measurement-induced topological network,” where one witnesses the emergence of long-range entangled channels along noncontractible loops on a torus. No existing photonic linear-optics experiment has mapped out such a topological percolation/phase transition via entanglement swapping.

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because:
 • All resources are probabilistic Bell-pair sources and static Bell-state measurements—no dynamic feedback, no cavities.  
 • The target is simply “maximally entangle node A to node B across a given homotopy class,” which Pytheus can optimize via its linear-optics graph search.  
 • The configuration can be varied in size (3×3, 4×4, …) and in pattern of swaps, providing a family of experiments.

Description:
Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation in a Bell-Pair Torus

Explanation:
We take an L×L toroidal lattice of photonic nodes. Each edge carries a Bell pair from a probabilistic source. Two opposite nodes, A and B, are chosen as “boundaries” between which we wish to teleport an unknown qubit. To do so, we perform Bell-state measurements (BSMs) on a subset of edges that forms a path on the dual lattice. When that path winds around a noncontractible cycle of the torus, A and B become entangled via entanglement swapping along that loop.

By varying which edges are measured (and how many), one can map out a “percolation threshold” p_c: the minimum density of BSMs required to achieve high-fidelity teleportation around each independent cycle. Pytheus’s job is to find, for each loop (say the “meridional” and “longitudinal” directions), the optimal static LO network (choice of beam splitters and detectors) that maximizes teleportation fidelity between A and B using only k BSMs. Repeating for k=1…K traces out the onset of topological connectivity.

Visualization (for L=3):
– Emitters/sources: Bell pairs on all 18 edges of a 3×3 torus (edges wrap around).  
– BSM modules: placed on k selected edges forming a continuous loop from A back to B along one homotopy class; each BSM is a 50:50 beam splitter + two number-resolving detectors.  
– Input qubit: encoded on one half of the Bell pair at node A.  
– Output qubit: recovered on the other half at node B after all k BSMs.  
– Postselection: keep runs where every BSM clicks once. Measure fidelity of teleportation from A→B.

This family of experiments concretely merges the PEPS picture (Bell bonds on a torus) with topological order (noncontractible loops), using only static entanglement-swapping networks to reveal a measurement-induced topological transition.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While mapping teleportation fidelity versus the number of Bell‐swap measurements around different noncontractible loops on a torus sounds like a nice demonstration of “percolation,” in practice it’s just a straightforward series of targeted entanglement‐swapping paths. You haven’t introduced any new measurement primitive beyond repeated Bell‐measurements, nor a genuinely stochastic percolation process—the experiment simply chooses which edges to measure, so there’s no emergent random connectivity to probe. Similar ring‐teleportation and dual‐path teleportation schemes already exist (e.g. the Zak‐phase tomography on a loop, and dual‐path Heisenberg dimer teleportation). This is more an exercise in varying the number of swaps than a fundamentally new topological‐quantum measurement.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: To achieve true novelty, propose a genuinely stochastic or adaptive measurement protocol (e.g. randomly enacted BSMs that self‐organize into percolating paths), or invent a new multi‐photon projection that unveils a topological phase transition—rather than simply measuring along predetermined loops.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible network experiments merging PEPS + topological order (focusing on entanglement swapping/teleportation rather than state generation):
 1) Plaquette‐stabilizer measurement via PEPS projections (already known).  
 2) Teleportation loops on a torus to read out anyonic braiding (too close to Zak‐phase tomography).  
 3) Measurement-based implementation of a logical Pauli operator (e.g. Z) on a qubit encoded in a 2×2 toric-code PEPS patch via entanglement-swapping network.

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus‐obstacles for (3):
 • Novelty: No prior photonic network has used a toric-code PEPS and only Bell-pair sources + BSMs to enact a logical Z on a teleported qubit in a single static circuit.  
 • Feasibility: Pytheus can handle probabilistic Bell‐pair sources on edges, single‐photon emitter for the input, static Bell-state measurements (50:50 beam splitters + number‐resolving detectors) for injection, patch projection, loop measurement, and extraction. No feedback, no cavities.

Step 3: Choose idea (3).

Step 4: Novelty
This protocol enacts the logical Z operator of the toric‐code on an unknown qubit by routing it through a 2×2 PEPS patch: you teleport the qubit in, perform a Bell-swap around the noncontractible cycle to apply Z, then teleport out. This is a purely network-based, linear-optics implementation of a topologically protected logical gate—no cluster states, no feed-forward.

Step 5: Feasibility
Pytheus can optimize five Bell-pair sources (four for the PEPS bonds + one for teleportation injection or extraction), two single‐photon emitters (one for the input, one for the output if desired), four static BSM modules at the patch vertices, and two extra BSMs for teleportation in/out.

Description:
Measurement-Based Logical Z Gate on a Toric-Code PEPS Patch

Explanation:
We build a minimal 2×2 toric-code PEPS patch whose four virtual bonds are Bell pairs. We implement a measurement-based logical Z on an unknown photonic qubit by:
1) Teleportation injection: perform a Bell-state measurement (BSM₀) between the input qubit (from a single-photon emitter E_in) and one half of a Bell pair (source S_in).  
2) PEPS projection: at each of the four vertices of the patch, perform a static BSM (M1…M4) on the two virtual qubits meeting there. This projects the four remaining halves onto the toric-code map.  
3) Loop measurement (logical Z): perform a BSM_L on the two virtual qubits along one noncontractible cycle of the patch. This step implements the logical Z on the encoded qubit.  
4) Teleportation extraction: perform a final BSMₓ between the logical output bond and a fresh Bell pair (source S_out), routing the now-Z-rotated qubit to the detection output.

Postselect on all BSM outcomes projecting onto |Φ⁺⟩ (trivial by-products). The overall transformation from E_in→Detector_Out is the Pauli Z gate: |0⟩→|0⟩, |1⟩→−|1⟩.

Generalization:
 • Implement logical X by measuring the orthogonal noncontractible loop.  
 • Chain patches to build a full logical Clifford group without feed-forward.  
 • Study robustness by allowing one “Φ⁻” outcome (error detection) using toric-code redundancy.  

This experiment fuses PEPS (virtual Bell bonds), topological order (toric-code logical operators), and entanglement-swapping teleportation to realize a measurement-based logical gate in a purely linear-optical network—entirely within Pytheus’s static‐network capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: Implementing a logical Z via one noncontractible‐loop measurement on a 2×2 toric PEPS patch is essentially a simpler version of the logical CNOT we already accepted—and of the plaquette parity measurements and loop‐phase tomography proposed earlier. It introduces no new projection primitive beyond Bell‐measurements, and a Z gate is a trivial subset of the Clifford operations once you can do logical CNOT and identity‐swap. This is therefore an incremental step rather than a genuinely new PRL‐worthy target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your logical Z gate is just the single‐loop version of the Bell‐swap projections already used for plaquette parity or the CNOT. Since no new measurement primitive or error‐tolerant feature is introduced, this falls short of true novelty—please propose a nontrivial multi‐loop or higher‐genus operation, or a measurement that implements a non‐Clifford logical gate without feed-forward.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three pure‐network experiments fusing PEPS and topological order (no state generation):
 1) Plaquette stabilizer via PEPS projections – known parity check.  
 2) Ring teleportation phase – too close to Zak‐phase tomography.  
 3) Measurement‐induced topological percolation: build an L×L Bell‐pair torus (PEPS virtual bonds) and place Bell‐state‐measurement (BSM) modules on every edge. By postselecting on the random subset of edges that actually fire, one unearths noncontractible loops of entanglement swaps and thereby a sudden onset of high‐fidelity teleportation between two opposite nodes.  

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus compatibility of (3):
 • Novel: No linear‐optics experiment has used postselection on spontaneously occurring measurement loops in a PEPS network to reveal a topological percolation transition.  
 • Pytheus can place probabilistic Bell‐pair sources on each edge, static BSM modules (50:50 beam splitters + two number‐resolving detectors per edge), and record all clicks. No feedback, no cavities, no state generation—pure entanglement swapping and postselection.  

Step 3: Select idea (3).

Step 4: Novelty  
This protocol uses the PEPS picture (Bell bonds on a torus) to realize a self‐organizing, measurement‐induced topological phase transition: when enough random edge‐measurements click, a noncontractible entanglement‐swap loop appears and teleports an unknown qubit across the torus with high fidelity.  

Step 5: Feasibility  
Pytheus can optimize an L=3 or 4 toroidal lattice of Bell‐pair sources and BSMs. We designate two opposite nodes A and B. All edges host a static BSM module. Each run yields a random subset of edges that successfully swap (ancilla detectors click). We postprocess the data: whenever the clicked edges form a continuous noncontractible loop around the torus, the fidelity of teleportation from A→B (inferred from joint detection at A and B) exceeds a threshold. Pytheus’s loss function can maximize fidelity separation between “loop” vs. “no‐loop” events.

Description:
Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation in a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice

Explanation:
We arrange an L×L photonic torus of nodes, with a probabilistic Bell-pair source on each of the 2L² edges (virtual bonds of a PEPS). At every edge we place a static Bell-state measurement (BSM) module—each module is a 50:50 beam splitter plus two number-resolving detectors. We select two opposite nodes, A and B, to serve as teleportation endpoints.

Procedure for each run:
1) All Bell-pair sources fire probabilistically.
2) Every edge’s BSM attempts an entanglement swap; ancilla detectors record which swaps succeeded.
3) At node A we inject an unknown qubit into the half-Bell pair there; at node B we hold the other half for measurement.
4) We postselect runs where the pattern of successful swaps contains at least one noncontractible loop (meridian or longitude) encircling the torus from A to B.
5) In those runs we verify teleportation fidelity between A and B via number-resolved coincidences.

By sweeping the acceptance criterion (the minimum number of simultaneous swaps required to close a loop) and the lattice size L, one maps out a measurement-induced percolation threshold pₙ at which long‐range topological teleportation “turns on.”

Generalization:
 • Vary L to study finite-size scaling of the percolation threshold.  
 • Compare meridian vs. longitude loops (two homotopy classes).  
 • Explore different planar graphs (hexagonal, Kagome) for measurement-induced topology.  
 • Introduce disorder by statically removing some BSM modules and re-map percolation.

This family of static, passive linear-optics experiments directly merges the PEPS structure of topological order with entanglement-swapping networks to reveal a genuine measurement-induced topological transition—an entirely new domain for photonic quantum networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond simply choosing predetermined swap paths by performing Bell‐measurements on every edge and using the random pattern of successful swaps to uncover noncontractible loops on a torus. Unlike prior ring‐teleportation or single‐path dual‐swap schemes, here the connectivity emerges stochastically, yielding a genuine measurement‐induced percolation transition of topological quantum channels. No earlier suggestion mapped out a percolation threshold for loop‐based teleportation on a toroidal Bell‐pair network, making this a novel photonic demonstration of measurement‐driven topological order.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: Your experiment introduces a new primitive—global, random entanglement‐swap measurements on all torus edges that self‐organize into nontrivial loops—allowing direct observation of a topological percolation threshold via teleportation fidelity. This transcends fixed‐path teleportation and single‐plaquette parity checks, opening a fresh avenue for measurement‐induced transitions in photonic quantum networks.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  

Abstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L×L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal outlines a device‐level design problem—finding a static layout of Bell‐pair sources and Bell‐measurement modules on a toroidal grid that, once postselected, percolates entanglement to enable teleportation from A to B. It fits squarely into PyTheus’s strength for automating networked entanglement‐swapping and measurement‐induced protocols, and though it will be resource‐intensive it is conceptually sound and novel in its use of percolation theory.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is an intriguing, well‐posed quantum communication task that leverages PyTheus’s network and measurement design capabilities. Optimizing for a percolation threshold on a toroidal lattice to ensure high‐fidelity teleportation is both novel and within the framework’s scope.
