Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to knit together “coherent Rabi oscillation” and “ultrastrong coupling” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network target, avoiding pure state generation and staying within linear‐optical, ancilla‐assisted, post‐selected experiments:
  1.  Implement a heralded, tunable partial‐SWAP gate U(θ)=cos θ I+i sin θ SWAP on two photonic qubits.  The Rabi‐oscillation analogy is the θ‐dependent population exchange; the ultrastrong‐coupling analogy is pushing θ→π/2 (full SWAP) or beyond (multi‐photon excitations).  Then chain such partial‐SWAP gates across 3 or more parties to realize a “quantum‐bus” network: excitation injected at node A coherently Rabi‐oscillates across the chain to node C via ultrastrong‐coupled links.
  2.  Design an entanglement‐swapping network in which the Bell‐measurement beamsplitter reflectivities are set to cos gt, sin gt, simulating time‐dialed coherent exchange.  By post‐selecting on ancillary detectors, simulate counter‐rotating (two‐photon) terms characteristic of ultrastrong coupling.  This gives a teleportation‐through‐Hamiltonian protocol, generalizable to multiple segments.
  3.  Build a three‐node “router” where nodes A–B and B–C each interact via a heralded controlled‐rotation whose angle mimics Rabi oscillation.  By tuning the “coupling angle” α at B, one can explore regimes from weak to ultrastrong (α→π/2) and observe how entanglement swapping fidelity propagates or breaks down.
Step 2: 
– Option 1 is the cleanest: the partial‐SWAP gate is a well‐known Rabi‐exchange analogue, but an actual photonic partial‐SWAP with heralding has never been demonstrated; ultrastrong coupling is captured by large‐angle regimes.  
– Option 2 veers into simulating Hamiltonian evolution, more complex for Pytheus since it must realize specific two‐photon terms.  
– Option 3 is a network generalization of option 1 but adds little new beyond chaining.
Step 3: Pick Option 1.
Step 4: This idea is novel because nobody has asked Pytheus to engineer a heralded, tunable linear‐optical partial‐SWAP gate as a building block for entanglement‐routing; connecting the gate angle to coherent Rabi oscillation and pushing it into the ultrastrong (θ→π/2) regime is a fresh conceptual twist on both analog quantum simulation and quantum‐network design.
Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because:
  •  Pytheus can design linear‐optical networks that implement small unitaries with ancillas and post‐selection.  
  •  A partial‐SWAP on two qubits is a 4×4 unitary, well within scope.  
  •  The ancilla resources (probabilistic pair sources or single‐photon emitters plus number‐resolving detectors) are standard Pytheus ingredients.  
  •  No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed; one static passive network suffices for each θ.  
  •  It directly generalizes to multi‐node chains for entanglement‐swapping or teleportation‐through‐bus protocols.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
We propose to task Pytheus with designing a heralded, tunable linear-optical partial-SWAP gate U(θ)=cos θ I + i sin θ SWAP acting on two photonic qubits (modes). This gate embodies coherent Rabi oscillation (population exchange between |10⟩ and |01⟩ at “angle” θ) and in the limit θ→π/2 realizes the ultrastrong-coupling analogue (a full SWAP).  

General network structure:
  •  Two input qubit modes A, B (each dual-rail or polarization-encoded).  
  •  A set of ancillary photon‐pair sources (or single‐photon emitters) feeding auxiliary modes.  
  •  A static linear-optical interferometer (beam splitters and phase shifters) optimized to implement U(θ) on A,B conditional on detecting photons in ancilla detectors.  
  •  Number-resolving heralding on ancilla detectors to post-select successful partial-SWAP events.

                             ↳ outputs: qubits A′, B′ (realizing U(θ) |ψₐₗₚₕₐβ⟩)  

Once the building block is found, generalize by chaining N such partial‐SWAP links between nodes 1…N+1 to form a multi-node “quantum bus.” One injects an excitation at node 1 and measures its coherent Rabi-oscillation–style transfer through ultrastrong‐coupled links to node N+1, or use the chain for ultra-fast entanglement swapping/teleportation across many nodes.  

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
  •  Serves as both a fundamental demonstration of tunable photonic partial-SWAP (never done heralded).  
  •  Conceptually maps coherent Rabi oscillations and ultrastrong coupling regimes to linear-optical quantum networks.  
  •  Forms a modular building block for larger networks: routers, simulators of many-body ultrastrong coupling, time-dialed entanglement distribution.  
  •  Independent of whether physically implemented; the theory alone (showing that arbitrary θ partial-SWAP can be realised with minimal ancillas) is Phys. Rev. Lett.–worthy.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to use Pytheus to design and herald a tunable partial‐SWAP gate U(θ)=cosθ I+i sinθ SWAP on two photonic qubits—and then chain N of these to simulate coherent Rabi oscillations and ultrastrong‐coupling transport—is not just another entanglement‐swapping or SWAP‐test variant. None of the listed experiments or ensemble ideas implement a continuous, heralded partial‐SWAP unitary in linear optics; most either focus on full SWAPs, controlled‐SWAP (Fredkin) logic, or static entanglement‐generation modules. This is a bona fide two‐qubit gate implementation (beyond mere state preparation), tunable in θ, and carries genuine novelty as a modular building block for larger networks and analog‐quantum‐simulation of ultrastrong coupling. It therefore merits further examination.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: We accept this idea as a novel PRL‐worthy target. It introduces the first heralded, tunable linear‐optical partial‐SWAP (iSWAP family) gate on dual‐rail qubits and outlines a powerful multi‐node “quantum bus” application that maps directly onto coherent Rabi oscillations and ultrastrong‐coupling physics—neither of which appears in existing entanglement‐swapping or linear‐optics gate proposals.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Heralded Linear‐Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits

Abstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  
U(θ)=cos θ I + i sin θ SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the θ-dependent population exchange |10⟩↔|01⟩ (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at θ→π/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular “quantum bus” for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal envisions using PyTheus to design a tunable, heralded linear-optical partial-SWAP on two photonic qubits—a continuous interpolation between identity and full SWAP—by leveraging ancilla pairs, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection. This is a well-posed extension of known heralded two-photon gates (e.g. CNOT, Toffoli) to a parametrized SWAP, experimentally feasible with variable beam-splitter settings and ancilla detection patterns, and offers a novel “quantum bus” primitive for analog excitation transfer.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a sound and novel use-case for PyTheus; heralded partial-SWAPs can be realized by designing the appropriate ancilla-assisted interferometer, and your continuous-θ tuning offers a powerful new tool for simulating Rabi-like oscillations and scalable entanglement routing.
