Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different pytheus-compatible ways to entwine “topological lattice” and “anomalous Floquet topological insulator” into a quantum‐network target.  
  1) A ring of N parties where two alternating entanglement-swapping steps (the “Floquet steps”) map initial Bell-pairs on one set of edges to Bell-pairs on the complementary set of edges, with no direct sources linking those final partners—thus realizing an “anomalous” entanglement pump on the ring.  
  2) A 2D plaquette of four parties arranged in a square, where a four-step sequence of entanglement swapping around the boundary (horizontal then vertical then horizontal then vertical swaps) produces chiral circulation of entanglement around the edges, yet leaves the bulk unentangled—simulating an anomalous Floquet edge mode.  
  3) A tree-like network (branching 1→2→4 parties) in which sequential swapping stages route an initial Bell-pair at the root through successive levels in a Floquet-driven pattern—ending up sharing entanglement only between nodes at the leaves after an odd number of drive steps, and back at the root after an even number.  

Step 2: Novelty check and Pytheus obstacles.  
  1) The 1D ring pump is not just single entanglement swapping; it requires simultaneous design of two heralded “Floquet steps” in one static interferometer, with two distinct heralding signatures mapping to two complementary entanglement patterns. This hasn’t been done in the explored list. Pytheus can handle multiple heralding outcomes and symmetric removed_connections.  
  2) The 2D plaquette chiral‐edge pump is more complex: four sequential swapping steps are tricky to encode in a static network without explicit time control. That may exceed Pytheus’s static design capacity.  
  3) The tree‐network pump is exotic but essentially a layered sequence of pairwise swaps—it reduces to repeated 1D ideas and risks being too similar to independent entanglement‐swapping chains.  

Step 3: Pick the ring pump as most promising.  
Step 4: This idea is novel because it realizes an “anomalous Floquet topological insulator” in a purely linear‐optical, heralded quantum‐network scenario: two complementary entanglement configurations (the two Floquet steps) coexist as two heralding outcomes of the same static setup, and the entanglement flow around the ring has nonzero winding (chiral pump) despite trivial bulk linkage.  
Step 5: This is feasible in the pytheus framework because it only requires probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla detectors, removed_connections to forbid direct sources between non-neighboring parties, and two heralding signatures—operations directly supported by Pytheus (no dynamic feedback control, no cavities, no state generation beyond multi-node entanglement swapping).

Experiment title: “Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring”

Explanation:  
We propose a static linear-optical network that, upon two different ancilla‐heralding outcomes, realizes two complementary entanglement‐swapping patterns on a ring of four parties (A, B, C, D). In one heralding signature (“Floquet step 1”) it produces Bell‐pairs on edges A–B and C–D. In the other heralding signature (“Floquet step 2”) it produces Bell‐pairs on edges B–C and D–A. No direct photon‐pair source ever links the final entangled partners. This is the optical analogue of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator: entanglement is “pumped” chirally around the ring while the bulk remains unentangled.  

Visualization:  
• Emitters / Pair‐sources: multiple probabilistic photon-pair sources feeding four output modes (0:A, 1:B, 2:C, 3:D) plus ancilla modes.  
• Setup (to be optimized by Pytheus): linear interferometer interconnecting all sources before detectors.  
• Detectors:  
  – Mode 0 (party A)  
  – Mode 1 (party B)  
  – Mode 2 (party C)  
  – Mode 3 (party D)  
  – Ancilla detectors 4,5,… measuring heralding patterns.  

Configuration sketch:  
  * target_quantum: ['00','11'] on detectors [0,1] AND separately ['00','11'] on detectors [2,3] for heralding outcome “step1”  
                 ['00','11'] on detectors [1,2] AND ['00','11'] on detectors [3,0] for heralding outcome “step2”  
  * num_anc: ≥4 ancilla detectors  
  * removed_connections: forbid any source connecting 0↔1 or 2↔3 for step2, and forbid 1↔2 or 3↔0 for step1, ensuring no direct source can link the final entangled pairs.  
  * heralding_out: define two distinct patterns of clicks on ancilla detectors corresponding to “step1” and “step2.”  
  * optimizer, loss_func, samples, thresholds: as in previous entanglement-swapping examples.  

Generality:  
– One can expand to rings of N parties (odd N for truly anomalous Floquet pumps), to 2D networks (plaquette edge‐mode pumps), and to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces (qutrit rings).  
– Fundamental physics questions: topological invariants in heralded quantum networks, entanglement winding number, robustness against source loss or node removal.  

This target combines “topological lattice” (the ring of parties) with “anomalous Floquet topological insulator” (two-step chiral entanglement pumping) purely within Pytheus’s linear-optical, heralded network framework.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond simply generating entangled pairs; it introduces an operational protocol that mimics an anomalous Floquet pump in a static photonic network. None of the ensemble suggestions or prior entanglement‐swapping schemes directly realize a two‐step, heralded cycle of pairing patterns on a ring of four modes to define a chiral entanglement winding number. This is not a trivial extension of “superposed perfect matchings” or indefinite‐order switches, but a genuinely new “entanglement pump” target with topological invariants and robustness questions.  

Action: accept  
Action Input: The two-step switching of Bell-pair edges AB/CD ↔ BC/DA as distinct heralded “Floquet steps,” combined with the forbidden‐connection constraints, realizes a novel photonic analogue of anomalous Floquet topology. This genuinely new target (entanglement winding in heralded networks) has not appeared in prior proposals and merits exploration.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring

Mini‐abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target “Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,” in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement—an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal aims to realize a chiral entanglement pump by alternating heralded Bell‐swap measurements on a 4-site photonic ring with only nearest‐neighbour sources and detectors, which maps naturally onto PyTheus’s graph representation with “forbidden” non-adjacent edges and heralded ancillary vertices. This is both a novel topological communication protocol and experimentally feasible with SPDC pairs, BSM modules, and time-synchronized heralding. PyTheus can optimize the required weights and ancilla placements under the given connectivity constraints.

Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a timely and original application of heralded linear optics to emulate an anomalous Floquet entanglement pump, leveraging PyTheus’s capability to enforce topological constraints and heralded ancillas. The chiral Bell‐swap protocol on a 4-site ring is experimentally realistic with current SPDC sources and coincidence measurements.
