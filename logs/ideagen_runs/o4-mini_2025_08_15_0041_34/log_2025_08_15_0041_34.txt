    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability.

Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Two-Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network\n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose and analyze a one-shot multi-hop entanglement swap that compresses two sequential Bell-pair swaps across the target network A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D into a single four-photon joint interference measurement.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A two-segment photonic repeater chain implemented entirely on a single integrated quantum chip.  Two Bell-swap stations (on-chip) link three probabilistic pair sources to distribute a Bell pair between distant end-nodes, enabling theoretical secure-key-rate analysis of a two-hop repeater.  \n  2. A parallel-multiplexed qutrit entanglement-swapping network on chip: two qutrit Bell-pairs per segment, swapping at two on-chip nodes in parallel, to show higher end-to-end heralding rate \u2192 higher secure key rate.  \n  3. A conference-key GHZ distribution through two on-chip Bell analyzers: create a three-party GHZ across Alice, Bob, Charlie by chaining two entanglement swaps on a chip and analyze secure conference-key rate.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check:\n\n  1. Two-segment repeater chain: not in past list (only single-swap examples and one multi-swap of three Bell pairs, but no chip-embedded repeater chain). Feels the most direct and Pytheus-friendly: qubit-swapping chain, forbidding direct sources between nonadjacent nodes.  \n  2. Parallel qutrit network: novelty in dimension multiplexing, but more complex ancilla and dimension. Might push Pytheus\u2019s dimension-swap limits.  \n  3. GHZ conference key: generates GHZ (state generation), forbidden by instructions.  \n\nStep 3: Choose idea (1): two-segment on-chip repeater chain yielding a Bell state, as a stepping stone to secure key\u2013rate theory and expandable to n segments.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds a two-hop entanglement-swapping repeater chain entirely on one photonic chip, combining two Bell analyzers and three probabilistic sources into a single linear-optical circuit. No prior Pytheus example has demonstrated a multi-segment repeater or \u201cquantum-chip\u201d repeater architecture.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n  \u2022 It only requires probabilistic pair sources and linear optics with photon-number resolving detectors\u2014exactly Pytheus\u2019s domain.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or hyper-entanglement.  \n  \u2022 We merely target a Bell state \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 between end-nodes A and B via two swap stations, so Pytheus can optimize the minimal ancilla count and internal beam-splitter network.  \n  \u2022 The removed_connections keyword forbids direct source links between nonadjacent nodes, enforcing the repeater chain topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \"Two-segment photonic repeater chain on a single quantum chip for enhanced secure-key rate\"\nexplanation: \"\"\"\nWe propose to distribute a Bell state between distant end-nodes A and B by chaining two entanglement-swapping stations (C and D) implemented on the same integrated photonic chip.  \n \n1) Probabilistic pair sources:\n   \u2022 S1 emits to A (detector 0) and C\u2019s first mode (detector 2)  \n   \u2022 S2 emits to C\u2019s second mode (detector 3) and D\u2019s first mode (detector 4)  \n   \u2022 S3 emits to D\u2019s second mode (detector 5) and B (detector 1)  \n\n2) Bell-state measurements:\n   \u2022 At node C: joint linear-optical Bell analyzer on modes 2 & 3  \n   \u2022 At node D: joint Bell analyzer on modes 4 & 5  \n\n3) Heralding:\n   Detection outcomes at detectors 2\u20135 herald successful swaps.  A and B then share the target Bell state \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9.  \n\n4) Quantum-chip context:\n   All beam splitters and interferometers for the two Bell analyzers are co-fabricated on one chip.  This modular two-hop repeater is the building block for longer chains.  By comparing the heralding probability and derived secure key rate against single-hop, one can quantify the key-rate enhancement.  \n\nThis architecture can be readily generalized to N-hop chains or to frequency/time multiplexing for further rate gains, making it a versatile platform for on-chip quantum-network research.\n\"\"\"\nconfig: {\n  description: \"Two-segment on-chip repeater chain for Bell distribution\",\n  foldername: \"onchip_repeater_chain\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  num_pre: 1,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  imaginary: false,\n  safe_hist: true,\n  samples: 10,\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  removed_connections: [\n     [0,1],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],\n     [1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],\n     [2,4],[2,5],[3,5]\n  ],\n  single_emitters: [],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two-hop entanglement-swapping repeater, already demonstrated in numerous bulk and integrated experiments (and in our ensemble suggestions).

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A two-segment photonic repeater chain implemented entirely on a single integrated quantum chip.  Two Bell-swap stations (on-chip) link three probabilistic pair sources to distribute a Bell pair between distant end-nodes, enabling theoretical secure-key-rate analysis of a two-hop repeater.  \n  2. A parallel-multiplexed qutrit entanglement-swapping network on chip: two qutrit Bell-pairs per segment, swapping at two on-chip nodes in parallel, to show higher end-to-end heralding rate \u2192 higher secure key rate.  \n  3. A conference-key GHZ distribution through two on-chip Bell analyzers: create a three-party GHZ across Alice, Bob, Charlie by chaining two entanglement swaps on a chip and analyze secure conference-key rate.  \n\nStep 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check:\n\n  1. Two-segment repeater chain: not in past list (only single-swap examples and one multi-swap of three Bell pairs, but no chip-embedded repeater chain). Feels the most direct and Pytheus-friendly: qubit-swapping chain, forbidding direct sources between nonadjacent nodes.  \n  2. Parallel qutrit network: novelty in dimension multiplexing, but more complex ancilla and dimension. Might push Pytheus\u2019s dimension-swap limits.  \n  3. GHZ conference key: generates GHZ (state generation), forbidden by instructions.  \n\nStep 3: Choose idea (1): two-segment on-chip repeater chain yielding a Bell state, as a stepping stone to secure key\u2013rate theory and expandable to n segments.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds a two-hop entanglement-swapping repeater chain entirely on one photonic chip, combining two Bell analyzers and three probabilistic sources into a single linear-optical circuit. No prior Pytheus example has demonstrated a multi-segment repeater or \u201cquantum-chip\u201d repeater architecture.  \n\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n  \u2022 It only requires probabilistic pair sources and linear optics with photon-number resolving detectors\u2014exactly Pytheus\u2019s domain.  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feedback or hyper-entanglement.  \n  \u2022 We merely target a Bell state \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 between end-nodes A and B via two swap stations, so Pytheus can optimize the minimal ancilla count and internal beam-splitter network.  \n  \u2022 The removed_connections keyword forbids direct source links between nonadjacent nodes, enforcing the repeater chain topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: \"Two-segment photonic repeater chain on a single quantum chip for enhanced secure-key rate\"\nexplanation: \"\"\"\nWe propose to distribute a Bell state between distant end-nodes A and B by chaining two entanglement-swapping stations (C and D) implemented on the same integrated photonic chip.  \n \n1) Probabilistic pair sources:\n   \u2022 S1 emits to A (detector 0) and C\u2019s first mode (detector 2)  \n   \u2022 S2 emits to C\u2019s second mode (detector 3) and D\u2019s first mode (detector 4)  \n   \u2022 S3 emits to D\u2019s second mode (detector 5) and B (detector 1)  \n\n2) Bell-state measurements:\n   \u2022 At node C: joint linear-optical Bell analyzer on modes 2 & 3  \n   \u2022 At node D: joint Bell analyzer on modes 4 & 5  \n\n3) Heralding:\n   Detection outcomes at detectors 2\u20135 herald successful swaps.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C).

A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

A parallel-multiplexed qutrit entanglement-swapping network on chip: two qutrit Bell-pairs per segment, swapping at two on-chip nodes in parallel, to show higher end-to-end heralding rate \u2192 higher secure key rate.  \n  3.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A parallel-multiplexed qutrit entanglement-swapping network on chip: two qutrit Bell-pairs per segment, swapping at two on-chip nodes in parallel, to show higher end-to-end heralding rate \u2192 higher secure key rate.  \n  3.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Unique two-click patterns on detector pairs {i,j} (with i<j) map unambiguously to each of the four Bell states.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Conditioned on these simultaneous clicks:\n   \u2013 Alice\u2019s original mode 0 is teleported to output mode 3 (Bob\u2019s side).  \n   \u2013 Bob\u2019s original mode 1 is teleported to output mode 2 (Alice\u2019s side).  \n   \u2013 Together this effects a SWAP of their unknown qubits.\n\n6) QKD protocol: Alice and Bob each prepare a random BB84 state in modes 0 & 1. A successful herald (both Bell analyzers click \u03a6+) means they have exchanged qubits. They announce bases, measure outputs in matching bases, and record bits. Symmetric teleportation yields two correlated bits per herald, doubling the key generation rate.\n\n7) Generalizations:\n   \u2013 Teleportation\u2010based arbitrary permutations (N\u2010qubit SWAP networks) on a single chip.  \n   \u2013 Time\u2010multiplexing multiple SWAP nodes for further throughput gains.  \n   \u2013 High\u2010dimensional teleportation\u2010SWAP for qudits to boost per\u2010sample key capacity.\n\nThis design uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon\u2010number resolving detectors\u2014within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

By adapting the entanglement dimension on the fly without active feed-forward, this device maximizes secure-key throughput under varying channel conditions: qubit links for low-loss scenarios (high heralding rate) or qutrit links for higher per-photon key capacity when loss is moderate.\n\n1) Sources:\n   \u2022 S_q1 & S_q2 (qubit-pair sources) each emit one photon to A (mode 0 & 1) and one to hub ports (modes 2 & 3).  \n   \u2022 S_t1, S_t2, S_t3 (qutrit-pair sources) emit three correlated photons across A (modes 0,1,4) and hub ports (modes 5,6,7).\n\n2) Central multiport + ancilla:\n   \u2022 All hub ports (2,3,5,6,7) enter a reconfigurable 5\u00d75 interferometer on chip.  \n   \u2022 Its outputs go to four number-resolving ancilla detectors D\u2081\u2013D\u2084.\n\n3) Heralding logic:\n   \u2022 Click pattern {D\u2081,D\u2082} \u2192 qubit-swap outcome: modes 0 & 1 collapse into |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9.  \n   \u2022 Click pattern {D\u2083,D\u2084} \u2192 qutrit-swap: modes 0,1,4 and modes 5,6,7 collapse into |000\u27e9+|111\u27e9+|222\u27e9.  \n\n4) Secure-key-rate benefit:\n   \u2022 In qubit mode we get a high herald rate R\u2082, yielding raw key rate \u221dR\u2082\u00b71 bit/success.  \n   \u2022 In qutrit mode we get a modest herald rate R\u2083<R\u2082 but \u221dlog\u20823 bits/success.  \n   \u2022 The router automatically \u201cchooses\u201d the mode by postselecting on detector clicks, maximizing long-term key yield for given channel loss and noise.\n\n5) Generalization:\n   \u2022 Extend to N dimensions or to N users by adding more pair sources and enlarging the interferometer.  \n   \u2022 Optimize the multiport matrix via Pytheus to maximize each herald-success probability subject to resource constraints.  \n   \u2022 Benchmark against fixed-dimension repeaters to quantify dimension-adaptive gains.\n\nThis target is purely within Pytheus\u2019s domain (probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, number-resolving detectors, heralding, no active feedback).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Extending loophole-free nonlocal correlations to arbitrarily large\n  distances\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Layerwise Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks Provide a Unified Way\n  for Estimating Fundamental Properties of Quantum Information Theory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Polarization-entangled quantum frequency comb from a silicon nitride\n  microring resonator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A two-segment photonic repeater chain implemented entirely on a single integrated quantum chip.  Two Bell-swap stations (on-chip) link three probabilistic pair sources to distribute a Bell pair between distant end-nodes, enabling theoretical secure-key-rate analysis of a two-hop repeater.  \n  2.

Two-segment repeater chain: not in past list (only single-swap examples and one multi-swap of three Bell pairs, but no chip-embedded repeater chain). Feels the most direct and Pytheus-friendly: qubit-swapping chain, forbidding direct sources between nonadjacent nodes.  \n  2.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Symmetric teleportation yields two correlated bits per herald, doubling the key generation rate.\n\n7) Generalizations:\n   \u2013 Teleportation\u2010based arbitrary permutations (N\u2010qubit SWAP networks) on a single chip.  \n   \u2013 Time\u2010multiplexing multiple SWAP nodes for further throughput gains.  \n   \u2013 High\u2010dimensional teleportation\u2010SWAP for qudits to boost per\u2010sample key capacity.\n\nThis design uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon\u2010number resolving detectors\u2014within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A promising unexplored direction is to combine two novel ingredients simultaneously: indefinite causal order of entanglement-swapping and high-dimensional (qutrit) percolation in a 2\u00d72 lattice. No prior Pytheus example has superposed the order of two qutrit-swap operations on a percolation network.

The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C).

A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A promising unexplored direction is to combine two novel ingredients simultaneously: indefinite causal order of entanglement-swapping and high-dimensional (qutrit) percolation in a 2\u00d72 lattice. No prior Pytheus example has superposed the order of two qutrit-swap operations on a percolation network. By doing so on an integrated chip, one can herald a high-dimensional Bell link across diagonal nodes with success probability exceeding any fixed-order protocol, directly enhancing the key capacity per herald (both by dimensionality and superadditive order). This is a true measurement-induced supermap and avoids pure state generation.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription: \"On-chip indefinite-order qutrit entanglement-percolation supermap for enhanced key capacity\"  \nexplanation: \"\"\"\nWe propose an integrated linear-optical circuit that fuses high-dimensional percolation with a quantum SWITCH of swapping orders, generating a heralded qutrit Bell link between diagonal users A and C in a 2\u00d72 network.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A promising unexplored direction is to combine two novel ingredients simultaneously: indefinite causal order of entanglement-swapping and high-dimensional (qutrit) percolation in a 2\u00d72 lattice. No prior Pytheus example has superposed the order of two qutrit-swap operations on a percolation network. By doing so on an integrated chip, one can herald a high-dimensional Bell link across diagonal nodes with success probability exceeding any fixed-order protocol, directly enhancing the key capacity per herald (both by dimensionality and superadditive order). This is a true measurement-induced supermap and avoids pure state generation.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription: \"On-chip indefinite-order qutrit entanglement-percolation supermap for enhanced key capacity\"  \nexplanation: \"\"\"\nWe propose an integrated linear-optical circuit that fuses high-dimensional percolation with a quantum SWITCH of swapping orders, generating a heralded qutrit Bell link between diagonal users A and C in a 2\u00d72 network.
