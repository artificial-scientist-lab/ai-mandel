    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

    "output": "Thought: The proposed target\u2014a four-click, ancilla-assisted linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates all four Bell states of two frequency-bin qubits\u2014is essentially the well-known ancilla-assisted complete Bell\u2010state analyzer first discussed for polarization qubits (e.g. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) and related schemes using two extra photons). Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details. Because complete, heralded Bell\u2010state analyzers using two single\u2010photon ancillas and number-resolving detection are already established in the literature, this proposal lacks the novelty required for a PRL target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance. To be considered, you would need to identify a fundamentally different mechanism (e.g. bypassing the two-ancilla requirement, using a new quantum interference effect, or demonstrating an unforeseen information-processing capability) rather than adapting a known scheme to a new degree of freedom."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) and related schemes using two extra photons). Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details. Because complete, heralded Bell\u2010state analyzers using two single\u2010photon ancillas and number-resolving detection are already established in the literature, this proposal lacks the novelty required for a PRL target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations).

Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details. Because complete, heralded Bell\u2010state analyzers using two single\u2010photon ancillas and number-resolving detection are already established in the literature, this proposal lacks the novelty required for a PRL target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance. To be considered, you would need to identify a fundamentally different mechanism (e.g. bypassing the two-ancilla requirement, using a new quantum interference effect, or demonstrating an unforeseen information-processing capability) rather than adapting a known scheme to a new degree of freedom.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cSpectral\u2010Mode Entanglement Swap Router\u201d  \nWe prepare two independent Bell\u2010pairs in two spectral channels, f1 and f2, shared between Alice and Bob on one side and Bob and Charlie on the other:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2081 (f1): A\u2081\u2013B\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2082 (f2): A\u2082\u2013B\u2082  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2083 (f1): C\u2081\u2013D\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2084 (f2): C\u2082\u2013D\u2082  \nAt Bob\u2019s station we input modes B\u2081, B\u2082, C\u2081, C\u2082 into a single static linear-optical network (to be optimized by Pytheus), together with four ancillary photons (from pair sources or single emitters).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>).

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) and related schemes using two extra photons). Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.

Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes.

By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed target\u2014a four-click, ancilla-assisted linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates all four Bell states of two frequency-bin qubits\u2014is essentially the well-known ancilla-assisted complete Bell\u2010state analyzer first discussed for polarization qubits (e.g. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) and related schemes using two extra photons). Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details. Because complete, heralded Bell\u2010state analyzers using two single\u2010photon ancillas and number-resolving detection are already established in the literature, this proposal lacks the novelty required for a PRL target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance. To be considered, you would need to identify a fundamentally different mechanism (e.g. bypassing the two-ancilla requirement, using a new quantum interference effect, or demonstrating an unforeseen information-processing capability) rather than adapting a known scheme to a new degree of freedom.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cSpectral\u2010Mode Entanglement Swap Router\u201d  \nWe prepare two independent Bell\u2010pairs in two spectral channels, f1 and f2, shared between Alice and Bob on one side and Bob and Charlie on the other:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2081 (f1): A\u2081\u2013B\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2082 (f2): A\u2082\u2013B\u2082  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2083 (f1): C\u2081\u2013D\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2084 (f2): C\u2082\u2013D\u2082  \nAt Bob\u2019s station we input modes B\u2081, B\u2082, C\u2081, C\u2082 into a single static linear-optical network (to be optimized by Pytheus), together with four ancillary photons (from pair sources or single emitters).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed target\u2014a four-click, ancilla-assisted linear-optical network that unambiguously discriminates all four Bell states of two frequency-bin qubits\u2014is essentially the well-known ancilla-assisted complete Bell\u2010state analyzer first discussed for polarization qubits (e.g. Grice, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042331 (2011) and related schemes using two extra photons). Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details. Because complete, heralded Bell\u2010state analyzers using two single\u2010photon ancillas and number-resolving detection are already established in the literature, this proposal lacks the novelty required for a PRL target.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance. To be considered, you would need to identify a fundamentally different mechanism (e.g. bypassing the two-ancilla requirement, using a new quantum interference effect, or demonstrating an unforeseen information-processing capability) rather than adapting a known scheme to a new degree of freedom.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Description:\n  \u201cSpectral\u2010Mode Entanglement Swap Router\u201d  \nWe prepare two independent Bell\u2010pairs in two spectral channels, f1 and f2, shared between Alice and Bob on one side and Bob and Charlie on the other:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2081 (f1): A\u2081\u2013B\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2082 (f2): A\u2082\u2013B\u2082  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2083 (f1): C\u2081\u2013D\u2081  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2084 (f2): C\u2082\u2013D\u2082  \nAt Bob\u2019s station we input modes B\u2081, B\u2082, C\u2081, C\u2082 into a single static linear-optical network (to be optimized by Pytheus), together with four ancillary photons (from pair sources or single emitters).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: High-speed quantum radio-frequency-over-light communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Optimal function estimation with photonic quantum sensor networks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Artificial stochastic neural network on the base of double quantum wells\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes.

By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

Simply porting this idea from polarization to frequency bins, even with plasmonic nanocavities as frequency-mode beam splitters, does not introduce a genuinely new quantum\u2010optical primitive or fundamental effect beyond mode-conversion details.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Physically one implements the tunable beamsplitters via plasmonic nanocavities to mix spectral modes, but Pytheus treats everything abstractly.\n\nExplanation:\n We label the two input qubits as in_nodes = [0,1], each carrying one photon in an unknown Bell state (|\u03a6\u00b1> or |\u03a8\u00b1>). We introduce two ancillary single-photon sources (single_emitters = [2,3]) whose photons feed into the same linear-optical network. The optimized network then routes the four photons into four distinct detectors. We assign four unique click-patterns (each a 2-photon coincidence among the four detectors) to the four Bell states, achieving unambiguous discrimination.\n\nVisualization (photons move top\u2192bottom):\n emitters:       [2]       [3]\n inputs:         [0]       [1]\n network:        [  to be optimized  ]\n detectors:      [A] [B] [C] [D]\n\nTarget mapping (target_quantum):\n  \u2013 Detection pattern P\u2081 = {1,1,0,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6+>\n  \u2013 P\u2082 = {1,0,1,0} \u21d2 |\u03a6\u2013>\n  \u2013 P\u2083 = {0,1,0,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8+>\n  \u2013 P\u2084 = {0,0,1,1} \u21d2 |\u03a8\u2013>\n\nConfig skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Frequency\u2010bin Bell\u2010state analyzer with plasmonic\u2010nanocavity tunable beamsplitters\",\n  foldername: \"freqBin_BSM\",\n  num_anc: 2,\n  single_emitters: [2,3],\n  in_nodes: [0,1],\n  target_quantum: [\"1100\",\"1010\",\"0101\",\"0011\"],\n  removed_connections: [],    # allow all mixing\n  number_resolving: True,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  loss_func: \"heralded_bsm\",  # custom loss that rewards one\u2010to\u2010one mapping of patterns to Bell labels\n  edges_tried: 40,\n  samples: 20\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting:\n\u2013 A full Bell\u2010state analyzer for frequency bins overcomes the 50% limit of passive linear optics alone.  \n\u2013 Tunable plasmonic nanocavities give practical spectral selectivity; abstract network design by Pytheus provides the blueprint.  \n\u2013 Such an analyzer is a key building block for high-rate, spectrally multiplexed quantum networks and teleportation protocols.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The ancilla-assisted 100%-efficient Bell\u2010state measurement using two extra photons in a static linear-optical network (Grice 2011 and follow-ups) already covers this functionality\u2014merely translating it to frequency bins with tunable plasmonic beamsplitters is an implementation detail rather than a new conceptual advance.
