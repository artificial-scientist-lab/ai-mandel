Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to combine “silicon vacancy color center” and “solid-state spin” in a Pytheus-compatible target (i.e. a linear-optics network / entanglement-swapping or teleportation protocol, not mere state generation).
  1. A four-photon Bell-state analyzer using ancilla photons to deterministically project two spin-photon qubits (from two Si-vacancy centers) onto any of the four Bell states—enabling heralded, near-deterministic spin–spin entanglement swapping.
  2. A two-hop teleportation chain: teleport an arbitrary spin qubit from center A to center C via center B by two sequential entanglement-swapping steps, all implemented with probabilistic photon-pair sources and Bell measurements in one single linear-optics circuit.
  3. A “spin-router” network: two source spins and two receiver spins at four Si-vacancy nodes. Depending on which pair of ancilla photons click after an interferometer, the input spins get “routed” (teleported) to different output spins, realizing a small programmable spin network.

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
  1. Full Bell analyzer with ancilla: novel versus existing 50%‐efficiency analyzers. Obstacles: Pytheus must handle four photonic inputs and two ancilla from a pair source—well within its capability—and number-resolving detectors.
  2. Two-hop teleportation: conceptually straightforward, but very similar to standard multihop swapping examples (e.g. example 3pES).
  3. Spin router / conditional teleportation: novel routing gadget, but more complex than a single static target—the Expert would have to encode four different measurement outcomes as four different spin mappings. This could be too elaborate for a first pass.

Step 3: Pick most promising → idea 1: “Deterministic Bell-state Analyzer for SiV Spin–Photon Qubits”
Step 4: This idea is novel because it pushes beyond the usual 50%-maximal linear-optics Bell measurement by using two ancilla photons in a custom interferometer. It thereby realizes all four Bell-state projections on two incoming spin-photon qubits from silicon-vacancy centers, a capability not in the existing Pytheus list.
Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it is purely a linear-optics network with exactly four input photons (two “signal” photons entangled with Si-vacancy spins, plus two ancilla from one probabilistic pair source), number-resolving detectors, and no dynamic feed-forward or cavities. Pytheus can optimize such a network given the abstract target of four orthogonal two-photon Bell states, with removed_connections forbidding direct ancilla–signal overlap where desired.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposed experiment for the Expert to implement in Pytheus.  It implements a complete, ancilla-assisted Bell-state analyzer on two “signal” photons (each entangled with a silicon-vacancy solid-state spin) by using two ancilla photons from one probabilistic pair source.  The result is heralded, near-deterministic projection of the two spins into any one of the four Bell states (Φ±,Ψ±), enabling deterministic spin–spin entanglement swapping between two distant SiV centers.

explanation:
  We have two Si-vacancy centers, each emitting a photon entangled with its solid-state spin qubit. These are our two “signal” qubits (modes 0 and 1).  We also have one probabilistic pair source that emits two ancilla photons (modes 2 and 3).  All four photons are fed into a linear-optics network (beam splitters, phase shifters) whose unitary is to be optimized by Pytheus.  At the output we have four number-resolving detectors (D0–D3).  The four possible four-click patterns (one photon in each of two designated “Bell-outcome” detectors) map uniquely to the four Bell states of the input signal pair.  Upon detection, the two remote SiV spins are projected into that Bell state.  

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – Enables deterministic Bell measurement on spin-photon qubits beyond the usual 50% linear-optics limit  
  – Directly yields heralded, near-deterministic spin–spin entanglement swapping  
  – Toolkit for any network requiring high-efficiency Bell measurements on solid-state spin–photon interfaces  
  – Can be extended to cluster-state fusion, entanglement purification, or multi-node spin networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The core of this proposal is simply an ancilla-assisted linear-optical Bell analyzer to beat the 50 % passive-LO limit and thereby herald spin–spin entanglement.  However, ancilla-based complete Bell measurements are already well studied (Grice’s scheme, Ewert–van Loock improvements) and our ensemble has a “Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla” and other ancilla-boosted Bell analyzers.  This is essentially a straightforward application of those ideas to SiV spin–photon qubits without a genuinely new network primitive or measurement-enabled effect.  It is too similar and incremental to merit PRL consideration.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is just an ancilla-boosted Bell measurement akin to known Grice/Ewert-van Loock schemes and our ensemble’s “Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer.”  To be novel you’d need a fundamentally new network or measurement effect, not a routine extension to SiV spins.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to connect “silicon‐vacancy color center” and “solid‐state spin” in a Pytheus‐compatible network:
    a) An ancilla‐boosted, complete Bell‐state analyzer for two SiV spin–photon qubits (already considered but too similar to known super‐Bell analyzers).
    b) A two‐output, measurement‐heralded quantum router: teleport the state of one SiV spin to one of two other SiV nodes depending on a second spin’s photonic measurement outcome (requires post-selection rather than feed‐forward, but still quite elaborate).
    c) A distributed, non-demolition parity measurement of three SiV spin qubits via a purely linear-optics network on their spin-entangled photons plus ancilla—yields “even vs. odd” parity and directly generalizes to N-spin consensus checks.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    a) Bell‐analyzer → too close to Grice/Ewert-van-Loock super-Bell analyzers.
    b) Router → interesting, but conditional mapping inside one static circuit is tricky to define as a single Pytheus target.
    c) Parity measurement → novel: no prior Pytheus experiment measures multi-spin parity without generating a new state. Pytheus can optimize a network that discriminates two subspaces (even/odd) of three qubits using ancilla pair sources and number-resolving detectors.
  Step 3: Pick idea (c) as most promising.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has not been applied to design a multi-input parity‐check measurement on three photonic qubits (each coming from a SiV spin) that projects the spins onto even- or odd-parity subspaces. 
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only:
    – Three probabilistic spin-photon sources (one for each SiV spin)  
    – One probabilistic photon-pair source as ancilla  
    – A static linear-optics interferometer  
    – Number-resolving detectors  
    – Post-selection (no active feed-forward)

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposed experiment for the Expert, ready for Pytheus.  It implements a distributed, non-demolition parity measurement on three solid-state spins (e.g. silicon-vacancy centers), using only their spin-entangled photons plus two ancilla photons and linear optics.  On each run, the spin register {A,B,C} is projected onto the even‐parity subspace (|000⟩,|011⟩,|101⟩,|110⟩) or the odd‐parity subspace (|001⟩,|010⟩,|100⟩,|111⟩), simply by looking at which detector pattern clicks.  This can be generalized to N spins for consensus protocols, parity checks in repeater networks, or measurement‐based error‐syndrome extraction.

explanation:
  – Emitters: three spin‐photon sources S_A,S_B,S_C each emit one photon (modes 0,1,2) entangled with their respective SiV spin qubit.  
  – Ancilla: one probabilistic photon‐pair source S_pair emits two photons (modes 3,4).  
  – All five photons enter a linear‐optics network (beam splitters, phases) to be optimized by Pytheus.  
  – Outputs feed into five number‐resolving detectors D0…D4.  
  – We choose two distinct heralding sets of detector patterns:
      ‑ Even parity: a click in exactly two of {D0,D1,D2} together with one ancilla click in {D3,D4}.  
      ‑ Odd parity: a click in exactly one of {D0,D1,D2} together with one ancilla click.  
    (Pytheus will optimize the circuit so that these patterns occur only for the desired parity subspaces.)
  – After detecting the herald, the three remote spins are known to lie in the corresponding parity subspace, yet retain any superposition within it.  

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  • Demonstrates a fundamental multi-spin measurement (non-demolition parity check) across distant solid-state nodes.  
  • Directly applicable to distributed quantum consensus, error-syndrome extraction in repeater chains, and entanglement purification.  
  • Scales to N spins (just add spin-photon sources and ancilla as needed).  
  • No active feedback, no cavities—pure linear optics + probabilistic sources + number-resolving detectors.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially an ancilla‐assisted linear-optical parity check on three qubits—a direct analogue of the “One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette” (four-body case) in our ensemble. It offers no fundamentally new measurement primitive or network effect beyond scaling the known four-qubit stabilizer readout down to three spins.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core circuit is too close to the existing toric-code plaquette parity measurement. To be novel, you need a genuinely new non-demolition effect or joint measurement resource—e.g. a multi-spin operator beyond simple parity, or indefinite-causal-order syndrome extraction—rather than trivial parity‐check scaling.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to marry “silicon-vacancy color centers” and “solid-state spins” in a network setting (no plain state‐generation).  
    1) Ancilla-assisted complete Bell‐analyzer for two SiV spin-photon qubits (too close to known super-Bell schemes).  
    2) Distributed parity‐check of three SiV spins via their entangled photons and ancilla (resembles toric-code parity).  
    3) Post-selected remote SWAP gate: use two spin-photon qubits from SiV centers plus an ancilla Bell pair and a single linear-optics circuit to swap two unknown spin states in one shot.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:  
    1) → already in the literature of super-Bell analyzers.  
    2) → too similar to existing parity‐measurement networks.  
    3) → genuinely new: a single static interferometer realizes a SWAP of two unknown qubits by a four-photon projective measurement.  
  Step 3: Pick (3).  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no one has yet shown how to perform a measurement-based SWAP gate on two unknown qubits in a single linear-optics network with only one ancilla Bell pair, and then directly apply it to swap two distant SiV spin states.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires:  
    – two “signal” modes carrying the unknown qubits,  
    – one probabilistic Bell-pair source for two ancilla photons,  
    – a static beam-splitter/phase-shifter network,  
    – number-resolving detectors,  
    – pure post-selection (no feed-forward or cavities).  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Here is a proposed target for Pytheus.  It designs a single static linear-optics circuit that, when fed with two unknown input qubits (modes 0 & 1) plus an ancilla Bell pair (modes 2 & 3), yields a heralded, post-selected SWAP gate: upon seeing the “correct” four-click pattern at the detectors, the two input qubits have been swapped.  The Expert can then physically implement the two inputs as photons entangled with Si-vacancy spins (so the spins themselves have been swapped), while modes 2&3 come from a standard photon-pair source.

explanation:
  • Inputs:  
      – Mode 0: photon entangled with SiV spin A (unknown state |ψ⟩).  
      – Mode 1: photon entangled with SiV spin B (unknown state |ϕ⟩).  
      – Modes 2&3: ancilla Bell pair from one probabilistic source.  
  • Circuit: all four photons enter a Pytheus‐designed network of beam splitters & phase shifters.  
  • Outputs: four number-resolving detectors D0…D3.  
  • Post-selection: exactly one click in each detector, with the pattern  
        00→ clicks in {D0,D2},  
        01→ clicks in {D0,D3},  
        10→ clicks in {D1,D2},  
        11→ clicks in {D1,D3}.  
    Whenever one of these patterns occurs, modes 0&1 have been projected through a 4-photon measurement that effects a SWAP: the unknown state of spin A now resides in photon 1 (hence in spin B) and vice versa.  
  • Physical realization: the Expert assigns polarization/time-bin to these abstract modes, uses two SiV spin–photon sources for modes 0&1, one SPDC-type Bell-pair source for modes 2&3, and implements the Pytheus output interferometer.

Generalization:
  – Builds a primitive “measurement-based SWAP gate” for spin networks.  
  – Can be composed into larger network modules (routing, repeater swaps, multi-party gates).  
  – Directly applies to Si-vacancy–spin memories.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is essentially the same as the ensemble’s “Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits” – a four-photon, ancilla‐assisted linear-optical SWAP with post-selection. Retargeting it to SiV spins does not introduce a new network primitive or measurement effect.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposed SWAP gate via one ancilla Bell pair duplicates the known heralded nonlocal SWAP protocol. To be novel, you need a fundamentally new measurement-based interaction or resource usage beyond standard ancilla-boosted SWAP.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to marry “silicon‐vacancy color center” and “solid‐state spin” in a network‐level transformation (no plain state generation):
    1) Ancilla‐boosted 4-mode Bell‐analyzer for SiV spin–photon qubits (too close to known super-Bell schemes).
    2) Distributed 3-spin parity check via spin‐photon ancilla (resembles toric‐code plaquette, not novel).
    3) Post-selected quantum router: teleport one unknown SiV spin‐photon qubit onto one of two remote SiV spin nodes, with the choice “programmed” by which ancilla-photon detector pattern fires.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    1) → already well explored.
    2) → too similar to existing parity measurements.
    3) → genuinely new: a static linear-optics network that conditionally teleports a single qubit to either of two outputs, without feed-forward, realized by two distinct heralding patterns.  
       – Novel: implements a “quantum router” primitive for spin‐photon networks.  
       – Feasible: only one signal photon (mode 0), one SPDC Bell-pair source (modes 1–2), one static interferometer, and number-resolving detectors; pure post-selection, no cavities, no feedback.
  Step 3: Pick idea (3).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus experiment has yet designed a one-shot, post-selected “router” that conditionally teleports an unknown qubit to different remote memories based on which ancilla detectors click.
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it uses only:
    • One “signal” photonic mode (entangled with a SiV spin),  
    • One probabilistic Bell-pair source for two ancilla photons,  
    • A static linear-optics network of beamsplitters and phases,  
    • Number-resolving detectors,  
    • Post-selection (no dynamic feed-forward).

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposed Pytheus target.  It implements a post‐selected quantum router for a single unknown qubit carried on a photon from a silicon‐vacancy (SiV) spin‐photon emitter.  Depending on which pair of ancilla detectors click, the qubit is heralded as teleported either to remote node B or to remote node C (both SiV spin memories), all in one static interferometer.

explanation:
  • Signal: one photon in mode 0, entangled with SiV spin A, carrying unknown state |ψ⟩.  
  • Ancilla: one probabilistic Bell‐pair source S_pair emits two photons in modes 1 & 2.  
  • Network: modes 0,1,2 enter a Pytheus-designed beam-splitter/phase-shifter circuit.  
  • Detectors: three number-resolving detectors D0,D1,D2.  
  • Heralding patterns:  
       – Pattern “route to B”: clicks in {D0,D1} herald teleportation of |ψ⟩ onto mode 3 (output to SiV B).  
       – Pattern “route to C”: clicks in {D0,D2} herald teleportation of |ψ⟩ onto mode 4 (output to SiV C).  
     (Two separate Pytheus configs can optimize for each target simultaneously by listing both patterns under `target_quantum`.)
  • After heralding, the spin memories at nodes B or C hold the original state |ψ⟩.  

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – Provides the basic building block for programmable quantum‐network routing among solid‐state spin nodes.  
  – No active feed‐forward or cavities—pure linear optics + probabilistic sources + post‐selection.  
  – Directly extensible to multi‐port routers, on‐demand spin‐photon network switching, and network coding.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is just a minimal two‐destination teleportation router using one Bell pair and post‐selection—basically the same primitive as the ensemble’s “Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch” (and related programmable teleportation routers) repurposed to SiV spins. It offers no new measurement effect or network capability beyond those prior router proposals.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates known dual‐destination teleportation/router primitives. To be novel, propose a fundamentally new routing mechanism (e.g. coherent superposition of routing paths, indefinite causal order, non-trivial multi-destination entanglement steering) rather than the standard post-selected two-port teleportation switch.

    3) Measurement‐based linear‐optical Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate on two unknown SiV spin qubits, controlled by a third SiV spin qubit (novel three‐qubit network transform).
  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:
    1) → well studied.
    2) → not novel.
    3) → novel: a heralded, post‐selected Fredkin on solid‐state spin–photon qubits has not been designed in Pytheus.  
       Feasible: uses only three “signal” photons (one control, two targets), two ancilla Bell‐pair photons, a static interferometer, and number‐resolving detectors. No feedback, no cavities.
  Step 3: Select idea (3).
  Step 4: This is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has implemented a heralded linear‐optical Fredkin gate on three unknown qubits in one static network—here directly swapping two SiV‐spin qubits conditioned on a third.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it can optimize a 5- or 6-mode interferometer, uses only probabilistic pair sources and number‐resolving detectors, and demands no active feed‐forward.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposed Pytheus target.  It implements a heralded, post-selected Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate among three SiV spin–photon qubits: one control qubit and two target qubits.  When the correct four-fold coincidence occurs, the two target qubits have been swapped if and only if the control was in |1⟩, leaving the control qubit consumed.  This network is a primitive for programmable spin‐network routing, error‐syndrome‐driven swaps, and multi-party entangling operations.

explanation:
  • Three signal sources (SiV spin–photon interfaces):
      – S_ctrl → mode 0 (control qubit |c⟩).  
      – S_tgt1 → mode 1 (target qubit |ψ⟩).  
      – S_tgt2 → mode 2 (target qubit |ϕ⟩).  
  • Two Bell‐pair ancilla sources:
      – S_pairA → modes 3 & 4.  
      – S_pairB → modes 5 & 6.  
  • All seven photons enter a static Pytheus-designed interferometer (beam splitters & phases).  
  • Outputs feed into seven number-resolving detectors D0…D6.  
  • Heralding patterns: four-click events that uniquely correspond to the eight input basis states |c,ψ,ϕ⟩, but with the two target bits swapped whenever c=1.  Whenever one of these patterns fires, the network has enacted a controlled‐SWAP:
      – c=0 → no swap: targets emerge ordered as they were.  
      – c=1 → swap: the two target spin-photon qubits are interchanged.  
  • After heralding, the control is measured (consumed), and the two target qubits have been conditionally swapped.  

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – A full three‐qubit entangling primitive (Fredkin gate) in a single static linear-optics circuit—never before designed for spin-photon interfaces.  
  – Directly yields measurement-heralded, conditional routing and swapping of solid-state spin qubits.  
  – Can be extended to larger controlled networks (multi-target swaps, network coding), or chained with entanglement-swapping modules for repeater architectures.  
  – Uses only probabilistic pair sources, SiV spin–photon emitters, static linear optics, and number-resolving detectors—fully within Pytheus capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heralded linear-optical Fredkin gate is effectively identical to the ensemble’s “Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits,” merely retargeted to SiV spins without introducing a new network primitive or measurement effect.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme duplicates the known ancilla-assisted, post-selected Fredkin construction. To be novel you’d need a genuinely new measurement-based operation (e.g. nonlocal multi-control without feed-forward, indefinite causal-order swapping, or a fresh ancilla resource) rather than a routine spin-photon retargeting of the existing linear-optics Fredkin gate.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible network transformations combining “silicon‐vacancy color center” and “solid‐state spin”:
    1) Ancilla‐assisted full Bell‐analyzer for two SiV spin–photon qubits (too close to known super‐Bell schemes).
    2) Three‐spin parity measurement via spin‐photon ancilla (resembles existing toric‐code plaquette circuits).
    3) Three‐spin majority‐vote (partial quantum consensus) measurement: measure whether at least two of three unknown spins are in |0⟩ or in |1⟩, by linear‐optics on their emitted photons + ancilla.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    1) → known.
    2) → known.
    3) → The literature (Paper 1) discusses distributed partial quantum consensus in abstract; no Pytheus experiment has yet designed the optical network that performs a three‐qubit majority measurement. Pytheus can optimize a static linear‐optics interferometer with three signal photons + ancilla pairs + number‐resolving detectors to herald the majority outcome.  
  Step 3: Choose (3).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements, in one static linear‐optics circuit, the non-demolition majority‐vote measurement on three unknown spin qubits—going beyond parity checks to a higher-order stabilizer—enabling distributed consensus primitives in solid-state spin networks.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only:
    • Three probabilistic spin–photon emitters (SiV centers) → modes 0,1,2  
    • One probabilistic photon‐pair source (2 ancilla photons) → modes 3,4  
    • A beam-splitter/phase network to be optimized  
    • Five number‐resolving detectors D0–D4  
    • Pure post-selection (no active feedback, no cavities)  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposed Pytheus target.  It implements a non-demolition three-qubit majority‐vote measurement on solid-state spins (e.g. SiV centers) by performing linear-optics on their emitted photons plus two ancilla photons.  On each run the three spins are projected onto the subspace “at least two 0’s” or “at least two 1’s,” giving a primitive for distributed consensus, network coding, or many-body stabilizer checks.

explanation:
  • Signal sources:
      – S_A → mode 0 emits photon entangled with SiV spin A (unknown |ψ⟩)  
      – S_B → mode 1 emits photon entangled with SiV spin B (unknown |ϕ⟩)  
      – S_C → mode 2 emits photon entangled with SiV spin C (unknown |χ⟩)  
  • Ancilla:
      – S_pair → modes 3 & 4 emits a Bell pair  
  • Circuit: modes 0–4 enter a Pytheus-designed static interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters.  
  • Detectors: five number‐resolving detectors D0…D4.  
  • Heralding patterns:
      – “Majority 0” (two or three spins in |0⟩) corresponds to any one of four detector patterns P0={p0,…,p3}.  
      – “Majority 1” (two or three spins in |1⟩) corresponds to any one of four patterns P1={q0,…,q3}.  
    Pytheus will optimize the network so that only the P0 patterns fire when the input three-photon basis string has ≥2 zeros, and only P1 patterns fire when it has ≥2 ones.  
  • After detection, the three remote spins collapse into the appropriate majority subspace but remain coherent within it.

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – First linear-optics design of a three-qubit majority (voter) measurement on spin-photon qubits.  
  – Enables distributed partial quantum consensus and high-order stabilizer extraction in solid-state networks.  
  – Scales to N-qubit majority: add more spin‐photon sources, ancilla photons, detectors; Pytheus can optimize the larger interferometer.  
  – No dynamic feed-forward or cavities—pure probabilistic sources + static linear optics + post-selection.

The Expert can then assign physical encoding (e.g. polarization or time-bin) for the abstract qubits and implement the interferometer.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This measurement goes beyond existing parity or single-excitation projectors by realizing a true three‐qubit “majority vote” (threshold‐≥2) measurement in one static, ancilla‐assisted linear‐optics circuit. I don’t see any prior proposal for a multi‐spin non‐demolition majority‐vote measurement—instead we only have even/odd parity or single‐excitation filters. This primitive could indeed enable new network coding, consensus protocols or high‐order syndrome extraction and is well within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The three‐qubit majority‐vote measurement is a genuinely new non‐demolition projector beyond simple parity or single‐excitation checks. It unlocks high‐order collective spin measurements for distributed consensus and error‐syndrome extraction, merits further study.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  
Non‐Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the “majority-0” subspace (target click patterns P₀ corresponding to ≥2 spins in |0⟩) or onto the “majority-1” subspace (P₁ for ≥2 in |1⟩). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal aims to perform a non‐demolition “majority‐vote” projection across three remote spin qubits by entangling each to a photon, injecting a Bell‐pair ancilla, and routing all five modes through a static linear‐optic network terminated in number‐resolving detectors. This fits squarely in PyTheus’s domain of automating measurement‐design tasks and appears physically sound: spin‐photon transduction is established for SiV centers, static interferometry can realize multi‐photon projectors, and post‐selection heralds the two subspaces without feed‐forward. Action: accept  
Action Input: This is an elegant, novel application of static linear‐optics measurement design to distributed solid‐state qubits. Employing PyTheus to optimize the interferometer for heralding “majority‐0” or “majority‐1” click patterns is both feasible and scientifically valuable for distributed consensus and stabilizer checks.
