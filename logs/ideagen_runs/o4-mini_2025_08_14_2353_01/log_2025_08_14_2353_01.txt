    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 4 ###\nES3d_sp\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two qutrits with single photon sources.\\n\\nWe want the photons entangled in a three dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is one where photons are emitted by single photon emitters (identifiable 'single_emitters').\\n\\nIn this case, six photons are emitted and the setup (which we optimize) manipulates them before they enter the detectors.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\n\\nemitters: [2][3][4][5][6][7]\\nsetup: [result of optimization]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\n\\nwhere [0] and [1] are the detectors where the Bell state should be created.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.

By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By viewing the two\u2010swap channel as a loop in quasimomentum space, one can associate a Bloch\u2010Hamiltonian Wilson\u2010loop phase to different path orderings\u2014opening a new class of networks probing second\u2010order topology.\n  Step 5: Feasible: only requires three Bell\u2010pair sources, two ancilla Bell\u2010measurements (one per swap), linear optics, and post\u2010selection.

At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states.

Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state.

By inserting on-chain phase shifters \u03c6_x,\u03c6_y this yields a two\u2010photon NOON\u2010like state at the final detectors whose relative phase equals the discrete Wilson loop \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.  The switch from bunching to antibunching at \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y=\u03c0 is the hallmark of a corner\u2010state signature of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n    3) A nested Bell\u2010swap commutator: perform two noncommuting swap\u2010measurements in different bases on a 2\u00d72 network to directly measure [U_x,U_y] of Bloch\u2010translation unitaries \u2192 too intricate for current Pytheus.\n\n  Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 2 is new (no existing example uses two chained swaps + coherent path splitting + recombination to yield a NOON with Wilson\u2010loop phase) and uses only PDC sources, single\u2010photon inputs, linear optics, phase shifters, Bell analyzers, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.  \n  Step 3: Choose option 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus hasn\u2019t yet explored multi\u2010path entanglement\u2010swapping interferometers that encode a 2D Bloch\u2010Hamiltonian Wilson\u2010loop phase into a heralded two\u2010photon NOON-state at remote detectors, with a clear corner\u2010state \u201cswitch\u201d at \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y=\u03c0.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it involves only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, a single\u2010photon emitter, tunable phase shifters, two Bell\u2010state analyzers, one final beamsplitter for NOON creation, and post\u2010selection\u2014no feedback, hyperentanglement, or cavities.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus target for a \u201ccorner\u2010state interferometer\u201d that nonlocally measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian by producing a heralded two\u2010photon NOON state at the opposite corner of a square.\n\nExplanation:\n  1.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections.

This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state. To reach PRL level, the proposal must go beyond GHZ creation\u2014e.g. demonstrate how the measurement outcomes directly witness the second\u2010order topological invariant or realize a nontrivial network diagnostic unavailable in simpler setups.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The scheme reduces to a standard GHZ fusion via cyclic Bell swaps, a trivial extension of known 4\u2010photon GHZ protocols (e.g. four\u2010party GHZ fusion). To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.

High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square. Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state. Because the network can be reconfigured to route qubits along other plaquettes or loop shapes, it generalizes to mapping out full topological phase diagrams of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n\nOptical network:\n  \u2013 Source1: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [0\u2192A,1\u2192B]  \n  \u2013 Source2: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [1\u2192B,2\u2192C]  \n  \u2013 Insertion of phase shifters \u03c6_x on mode-1 paths from Source1, \u03c6_y on mode-1 from Source2  \n  \u2013 Bell-state analyzer 1 at B: mixes one photon from Source1 & one from Source2 \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n  \u2013 Remaining photon at A (mode 0) and at C (mode 2) emerge in a conditional two-mode entangled channel whose fidelity to the ideal teleported qubit is F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y).  \n  \u2013 (Modes D omitted; only corners A and C matter.)\n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Corner-teleportation interferometer \u2192 measure Wilson-loop phase of 2D Bloch Hamiltonian & corner state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_teleport_loop\",\n  num_anc: 2,                    # two Bell-swap ancilla detectors\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],           # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]],\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],   # final Bell correlations between modes 0 (A) & 2 (C)\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 20,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes indexed 0=A,1=B,2=C):\n   Source1       Source2\n    \u21980     1\u2199        \u21981     2\u2199\n      [\u03c6_x]              [\u03c6_y]\n         \u2198     \u2199              \u2198    \u2199\n          \u2020Bell swap\u2020   (ancilla clicks D\u2081,D\u2082)\n         /     \\\n        0       2  \u2192 heralded teleportation from A\u2192C\n\nBy scanning \u03c6_x and \u03c6_y, one directly maps out the discrete Wilson-loop phase \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes.

In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square. Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state. Because the network can be reconfigured to route qubits along other plaquettes or loop shapes, it generalizes to mapping out full topological phase diagrams of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n\nOptical network:\n  \u2013 Source1: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [0\u2192A,1\u2192B]  \n  \u2013 Source2: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [1\u2192B,2\u2192C]  \n  \u2013 Insertion of phase shifters \u03c6_x on mode-1 paths from Source1, \u03c6_y on mode-1 from Source2  \n  \u2013 Bell-state analyzer 1 at B: mixes one photon from Source1 & one from Source2 \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n  \u2013 Remaining photon at A (mode 0) and at C (mode 2) emerge in a conditional two-mode entangled channel whose fidelity to the ideal teleported qubit is F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y).  \n  \u2013 (Modes D omitted; only corners A and C matter.)\n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Corner-teleportation interferometer \u2192 measure Wilson-loop phase of 2D Bloch Hamiltonian & corner state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_teleport_loop\",\n  num_anc: 2,                    # two Bell-swap ancilla detectors\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],           # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]],\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],   # final Bell correlations between modes 0 (A) & 2 (C)\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 20,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes indexed 0=A,1=B,2=C):\n   Source1       Source2\n    \u21980     1\u2199        \u21981     2\u2199\n      [\u03c6_x]              [\u03c6_y]\n         \u2198     \u2199              \u2198    \u2199\n          \u2020Bell swap\u2020   (ancilla clicks D\u2081,D\u2082)\n         /     \\\n        0       2  \u2192 heralded teleportation from A\u2192C\n\nBy scanning \u03c6_x and \u03c6_y, one directly maps out the discrete Wilson-loop phase \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection.

Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state.

High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle).

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square. Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state. Because the network can be reconfigured to route qubits along other plaquettes or loop shapes, it generalizes to mapping out full topological phase diagrams of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n\nOptical network:\n  \u2013 Source1: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [0\u2192A,1\u2192B]  \n  \u2013 Source2: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [1\u2192B,2\u2192C]  \n  \u2013 Insertion of phase shifters \u03c6_x on mode-1 paths from Source1, \u03c6_y on mode-1 from Source2  \n  \u2013 Bell-state analyzer 1 at B: mixes one photon from Source1 & one from Source2 \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n  \u2013 Remaining photon at A (mode 0) and at C (mode 2) emerge in a conditional two-mode entangled channel whose fidelity to the ideal teleported qubit is F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y).  \n  \u2013 (Modes D omitted; only corners A and C matter.)\n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Corner-teleportation interferometer \u2192 measure Wilson-loop phase of 2D Bloch Hamiltonian & corner state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_teleport_loop\",\n  num_anc: 2,                    # two Bell-swap ancilla detectors\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],           # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]],\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],   # final Bell correlations between modes 0 (A) & 2 (C)\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 20,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes indexed 0=A,1=B,2=C):\n   Source1       Source2\n    \u21980     1\u2199        \u21981     2\u2199\n      [\u03c6_x]              [\u03c6_y]\n         \u2198     \u2199              \u2198    \u2199\n          \u2020Bell swap\u2020   (ancilla clicks D\u2081,D\u2082)\n         /     \\\n        0       2  \u2192 heralded teleportation from A\u2192C\n\nBy scanning \u03c6_x and \u03c6_y, one directly maps out the discrete Wilson-loop phase \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state.

High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle).

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square. Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state. Because the network can be reconfigured to route qubits along other plaquettes or loop shapes, it generalizes to mapping out full topological phase diagrams of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n\nOptical network:\n  \u2013 Source1: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [0\u2192A,1\u2192B]  \n  \u2013 Source2: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [1\u2192B,2\u2192C]  \n  \u2013 Insertion of phase shifters \u03c6_x on mode-1 paths from Source1, \u03c6_y on mode-1 from Source2  \n  \u2013 Bell-state analyzer 1 at B: mixes one photon from Source1 & one from Source2 \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n  \u2013 Remaining photon at A (mode 0) and at C (mode 2) emerge in a conditional two-mode entangled channel whose fidelity to the ideal teleported qubit is F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y).  \n  \u2013 (Modes D omitted; only corners A and C matter.)\n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Corner-teleportation interferometer \u2192 measure Wilson-loop phase of 2D Bloch Hamiltonian & corner state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_teleport_loop\",\n  num_anc: 2,                    # two Bell-swap ancilla detectors\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],           # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]],\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],   # final Bell correlations between modes 0 (A) & 2 (C)\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 20,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes indexed 0=A,1=B,2=C):\n   Source1       Source2\n    \u21980     1\u2199        \u21981     2\u2199\n      [\u03c6_x]              [\u03c6_y]\n         \u2198     \u2199              \u2198    \u2199\n          \u2020Bell swap\u2020   (ancilla clicks D\u2081,D\u2082)\n         /     \\\n        0       2  \u2192 heralded teleportation from A\u2192C\n\nBy scanning \u03c6_x and \u03c6_y, one directly maps out the discrete Wilson-loop phase \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection.

Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state.

Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors.

Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0.

This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors.

Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3).

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state. To reach PRL level, the proposal must go beyond GHZ creation\u2014e.g. demonstrate how the measurement outcomes directly witness the second\u2010order topological invariant or realize a nontrivial network diagnostic unavailable in simpler setups.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The scheme reduces to a standard GHZ fusion via cyclic Bell swaps, a trivial extension of known 4\u2010photon GHZ protocols (e.g. four\u2010party GHZ fusion). To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward.

By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state. To reach PRL level, the proposal must go beyond GHZ creation\u2014e.g. demonstrate how the measurement outcomes directly witness the second\u2010order topological invariant or realize a nontrivial network diagnostic unavailable in simpler setups.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The scheme reduces to a standard GHZ fusion via cyclic Bell swaps, a trivial extension of known 4\u2010photon GHZ protocols (e.g. four\u2010party GHZ fusion). To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

By inserting tunable local linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C, the combined heralded teleportation fidelity \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) directly measures the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the sign flip in correlations signals the emergence of a corner state.  \n    3) A four-edge Bell-swap network that enacts the commutator [U_x,U_y] of two unitary hopping operators (Bloch\u2010translations), read out by ancilla clicks\u2014too intricate for Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics primitives.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1) GHZ ring is just cycle swapping \u2192 state generation (forbidden).  \n    2) Corner-teleport interferometer is new in Pytheus (no two-step teleportation with tunable phases has been optimized), and it ties directly to Bloch Wilson loops and corner states. Uses only Bell pairs, swaps, phase shifters, and post-selection.  \n    3) Commutator scheme likely exceeds Pytheus\u2019s scope.  \n  Step 3: Choose idea 2.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has never designed a multi-swap teleportation network whose heralded fidelity encodes the discrete Wilson\u2010loop phase of a synthetic Bloch Hamiltonian, and it predicts a sign inversion (corner state) at a specific phase setting (\u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0).  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires three probabilistic photon-pair sources, two Bell-state analyzers (linear optics + photon counters), standard beam\u2010splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square. Our goal is to teleport an unknown qubit from A to C via two sequential Bell-swaps on edges A\u2013B and B\u2013C, while inserting tunable linear-optics phases \u03c6_x on edge A\u2013B and \u03c6_y on B\u2013C. The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette. At \u03c6_x=\u03c6_y=\u03c0 the fidelity flips sign\u2014this is the photonic analogue of a second\u2010order topological corner state. Because the network can be reconfigured to route qubits along other plaquettes or loop shapes, it generalizes to mapping out full topological phase diagrams of Bloch Hamiltonians.\n\nOptical network:\n  \u2013 Source1: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [0\u2192A,1\u2192B]  \n  \u2013 Source2: probabilistic Bell pair into modes [1\u2192B,2\u2192C]  \n  \u2013 Insertion of phase shifters \u03c6_x on mode-1 paths from Source1, \u03c6_y on mode-1 from Source2  \n  \u2013 Bell-state analyzer 1 at B: mixes one photon from Source1 & one from Source2 \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082  \n  \u2013 Remaining photon at A (mode 0) and at C (mode 2) emerge in a conditional two-mode entangled channel whose fidelity to the ideal teleported qubit is F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y).  \n  \u2013 (Modes D omitted; only corners A and C matter.)\n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Corner-teleportation interferometer \u2192 measure Wilson-loop phase of 2D Bloch Hamiltonian & corner state\",\n  foldername: \"corner_teleport_loop\",\n  num_anc: 2,                    # two Bell-swap ancilla detectors\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],           # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [[0,2],[0,3],[1,3],[2,3]],\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],   # final Bell correlations between modes 0 (A) & 2 (C)\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 20,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes indexed 0=A,1=B,2=C):\n   Source1       Source2\n    \u21980     1\u2199        \u21981     2\u2199\n      [\u03c6_x]              [\u03c6_y]\n         \u2198     \u2199              \u2198    \u2199\n          \u2020Bell swap\u2020   (ancilla clicks D\u2081,D\u2082)\n         /     \\\n        0       2  \u2192 heralded teleportation from A\u2192C\n\nBy scanning \u03c6_x and \u03c6_y, one directly maps out the discrete Wilson-loop phase \u03c6_x+\u03c6_y.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node.

A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>.

Framing it as \u201ccorner states of a Bloch Hamiltonian\u201d does not by itself yield new physics or a detectable topological invariant beyond producing a GHZ state. To reach PRL level, the proposal must go beyond GHZ creation\u2014e.g. demonstrate how the measurement outcomes directly witness the second\u2010order topological invariant or realize a nontrivial network diagnostic unavailable in simpler setups.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The scheme reduces to a standard GHZ fusion via cyclic Bell swaps, a trivial extension of known 4\u2010photon GHZ protocols (e.g. four\u2010party GHZ fusion). To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

There is no genuinely new measurement of a Wilson loop or extraction of a higher-order topological invariant; the final heralded output is simply a teleported qubit or Bell pair, as in countless prior proposals.  The narrative of probing Bloch Hamiltonian invariants is not backed by an operationally distinct observable beyond the trivial swapped link.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To make this PRL-worthy, you must go beyond concatenating swaps.  For example, define a concrete interferometric witness of the Wilson-loop phase (not just routing), or demonstrate a nontrivial topology-protected signature in the click statistics that cannot be reduced to standard teleportation fidelity.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201ccorner-teleportation interferometer\u201d that measures the Wilson-loop phase of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian and realizes a topological corner-state signature.\n\nExplanation:\nWe arrange four spatial modes A,B,C,D in a square.

The overall heralded teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6_x,\u03c6_y) \u221dcos(\u03c6_x+\u03c6_y) yields the value of the discrete Wilson loop around that plaquette.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Four\u2010party GHZ around a square network: treat the four output modes as the \u201ccorner states\u201d of a 2\u00d72 synthetic lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has a nontrivial second\u2010order topology. Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes. Without this, the target is not sufficiently distinct from existing GHZ entanglement\u2010swapping or fusion designs.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The concatenated network implements \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d teleportation, which can be interpreted as probing a Wilson\u2010loop (Zak\u2010phase) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian when generalized to many paths.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0. Each successful analyzer click (4 ancilla detectors total) heralds one link swap.  \n5) Conditioned on all four ancilla clicks, the remaining photon at mode 0 (A) and the reference at mode 4 (R) emerge. We then check their entanglement via parity detection (Bell basis) as our final \u201ccorner\u2010state witness.\u201d  \n6) In the trivial Bloch phase (\u03c6\u2093+\u03c6_y=0), the closed-loop teleportation faithfully preserves the R\u2013A Bell correlations. In the topological quadrupole phase (\u03c6\u2093=\u03c6_y=\u03c0), the protocol picks up a \u03c0 Berry phase around the loop, flipping the parity of the R\u2013A Bell outcome\u2014this sign flip is the hallmark of a corner state.  \n\nPytheus configuration skeleton:\n{\n  description: \"Looped-teleportation corner-state witness \u2192 simulate quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian & detect corner state via entanglement fidelity\",\n  foldername: \"quad_loop_corner_witness\",\n  single_emitters: [],        # all sources are probabilistic PDC\n  # Bell-pair sources:\n  #   REF\u2192[4,0], AB\u2192[0,1], BC\u2192[1,2], CD\u2192[2,3], DA\u2192[3,0]\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],  # forbid direct reference links\n  num_anc: 4,                 # one Bell measurement per edge\n  num_pre: 1,\n  target_quantum: ['00','11'],# R\u2013A Bell parity at the end\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout (modes 0\u20133 = A\u2013D, mode 4 = R):\n      Source_REF       Source_AB      Source_BC      Source_CD      Source_DA\n        4\u21940             0\u21941            1\u21942            2\u21943            3\u21940\n           \u2198             \u2199 Bell          \u2199 Bell         \u2199 Bell       \u2199 Bell\n       [R\u2013A]        Analyzer1       Analyzer2       Analyzer3    Analyzer4\n           \u2196             \u2198            \u2198            \u2198           \u2198\n                             Final R\u2013A Bell measurement\n\nBy scanning the phases \u03c6\u2093,\u03c6_y on alternating edges, one simulates the BBH quadrupole Hamiltonian and directly reads out its corner state via the parity flip of the surviving R\u2013A entanglement.  \nGeneralizations: larger plaquettes, higher dimensions, multi-loop braids, and network-encoded higher-order invariants.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The target reduces to standard sequential Bell swaps with phase scans\u2014closely mirroring prior \u201cZak Phase Tomography\u201d and looped teleportation schemes.

Modes:\n   \u2022 A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 are the four corners of a square.  \n   \u2022 R=4 is an external reference qubit.  \n2. Photon\u2010pair sources:\n   \u2022 Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0] creates a reference Bell pair R\u2013A.  \n   \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (edge A\u2013B)  \n   \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (B\u2013C)  \n   \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (C\u2013D)  \n   \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (D\u2013A)  \n3. Alternating reflectivities:\n   \u2022 Beam splitters on edges AB & CD have reflectivity r\u2081 (\u201cintra\u2010cell\u201d coupling).  \n   \u2022 Beam splitters on edges BC & DA have reflectivity r\u2082 (\u201cinter\u2010cell\u201d coupling).  \n   Tuning r\u2081,r\u2082 simulates the BBH quadrupole model\u2019s alternating hoppings.  \n4. Four sequential Bell\u2010swap analyzers:\n   \u2013 Analyzer_AB mixes modes (0,1) \u2192 ancilla detectors D\u2081,D\u2082 herald swap along AB.  \n   \u2013 Analyzer_BC mixes (1,2) \u2192 D\u2083,D\u2084 herald BC.  \n   \u2013 Analyzer_CD mixes (2,3) \u2192 D\u2085,D\u2086 herald CD.  \n   \u2013 Analyzer_DA mixes (3,0) \u2192 D\u2087,D\u2088 herald DA.  \n   Each analyzer is a 50:50 BS with adjustable r (the same BS that implements swapping) and two photon\u2010counters.  \n5. After four successful ancilla clicks, the reference qubit at R and the teleported qubit return to mode A if the network is in the trivial phase (r\u2081>r\u2082), or remain localized at D and B if in the topological phase (r\u2081<r\u2082)\u2014corner\u2010state localization of entanglement.  \n6.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Integrated quantum communication network and vibration sensing in\n  optical fibers\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Reducing the number of single-photon detectors in quantum key\n  distribution networks by time multiplexing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Telecom Quantum Photonic Interface for a $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Single-Ion\n  Quantum Memory\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Build a Bell\u2010pair chain on the four edges and perform entanglement swaps in a loop so that the final 4 photons at the corners emerge in a GHZ state. Correlations in that GHZ encode the existence of topological corner modes.\n    2. Teleportation of a Bloch\u2010momentum qubit from one corner of a 2\u00d72 Brillouin\u2010zone lattice to the opposite corner, using a two\u2010step entanglement\u2010swapping network that projects onto Wilson\u2010loop eigenstates of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian. The fidelity of the teleportation reveals the Zak phase around the plaquette.\n    3. High\u2010dimensional entanglement swapping to entangle two \u201ccorner\u201d momentum eigenmodes (e.g. (0,0) and (\u03c0,\u03c0)) of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian, via two Bell pairs on the edges of the Brillouin zone. This is essentially a 4-dimensional ES analogous to ES_246 but now interpreted as corner states of a second\u2010order topological insulator.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacle check.\n    1. Four\u2010party GHZ via ring swapping is not in the existing list (they did only Bell pairs, product of Bell, but no multi\u2010node GHZ generated by swapping in a cycle). Physically interprets corners of a Bloch Hamiltonian. Pytheus obstacle: GHZ needs \u22653 Bell swaps; feasible with PDC and ancillas.\n    2. Teleportation of Bloch qubit: looks elegant but the target is a process (carrier fidelity) rather than a static multipartite state, and Pytheus only optimizes state targets.\n    3. 4d ES is too close to ES_246, only a reinterpretation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 1: the four\u2010party GHZ network of Bloch\u2010corner states.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has built a cyclic swapping network to produce a multi\u2010node GHZ state, and it explicitly maps to the physics of second\u2010order topological corner modes of a 2D Bloch Hamiltonian.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit encoding, four Bell\u2010pair PDC sources (or single emitters), local beam splitters for Bell measurements, and four ancilla detections. No feedback, no cavities, no hyperentanglement\u2014all within linear optics and probabilistic sources.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a well\u2010specified Pytheus target for an entanglement\u2010swapping ring that generates a 4-photon GHZ state living on the \u201ccorners\u201d of a synthetic 2\u00d72 lattice (i.e. the corner states of a second\u2010order topological Bloch Hamiltonian):\n\nExplanation:\nWe label four output modes/corners A,B,C,D corresponding to the four corners of a 2\u00d72 lattice whose Bloch Hamiltonian has nontrivial corner states. We generate four Bell\u2010pair sources on the edges (A\u2013B, B\u2013C, C\u2013D, D\u2013A). At each of the four edge junctions we perform a Bell\u2010state measurement (using linear optics) on one photon from each adjacent pair. Conditioned on successful joint detections at those four ancilla detectors, the remaining one photon in each of A,B,C,D emerges projected into the GHZ state |0000>+|1111>. This cyclic swapping realizes a \u201ccorner\u2010to\u2010corner\u201d nonlocal correlation pattern that directly encodes the second\u2010order topological invariant of the underlying Bloch Hamiltonian.\n\nConfiguration skeleton (to hand off to Pytheus):\n{\n  description: \"4\u2010node GHZ by cyclic entanglement swapping \u2192 corner states of a 2D topological Bloch Hamiltonian\",\n  foldername: \"GHZ_corner_bloch\",\n  num_anc: 4,             # one ancilla detector per edge swap\n  num_pre: 1,\n  single_emitters: [],    # using probabilistic PDC sources\n  removed_connections: [  # forbid any PDC source from linking non\u2010adjacent corners directly\n    [0,2], [1,3]\n  ],\n  target_quantum: ['0000','1111'],  # GHZ on modes A,B,C,D\n  loss_func: 'cr',\n  optimizer: 'L-BFGS-B',\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}\n\nVisual layout:\n\n   Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n     source1             source2\n     \u2198   \u2199               \u2198   \u2199\n      A   B             B   C\n       \\ /                 \\\n        \u2020  Bell measure     \u2020  Bell measure\n       / \\                 /\n      D   A             C   D\n     \u2197   \u2196               \u2197   \u2196\n  Bell\u2013pair PDC      Bell\u2013pair PDC\n   source4             source3\n\nAfter the four Bell measurements (\u2020), modes A,B,C,D collapse into |0000>+|1111>.

To be novel, you must show an operational way to extract or leverage the second\u2010order topological invariant\u2014not just generate a GHZ state on \u201ccorner\u201d modes.

Harder to guarantee novelty and to encode Bloch physics.\n\n  Step 2: Quick checks:\n    1) Forbidden (state generation).\n    2) Novel? Standard teleportation is one swap.

By tuning the beam-splitter \u201chopping\u201d phases on alternating edges (simulating the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian), the teleportation fidelity F(\u03c6\u2093,\u03c6\u1d67) exhibits a sharp dip or sign change exactly when the model hosts a corner state.  \n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    \u2013 Option 1 is out. Option 2 is interesting but too similar to two-swap phase interferometers. Option 3 is novel: it uses a closed-loop teleportation channel to simulate a Floquet step of the quadrupole model and then reads out a corner-state signature via entanglement fidelity.  \n    \u2013 Feasible with Pytheus: needs one reference Bell source, four link Bell sources, four sequential Bell analyzers, linear optics, phases, and post-selection. No feedback, no cavities.  \n  Step 3: Pick option 3.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has used a closed-loop entanglement-swap teleportation channel to simulate a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian and to read out its corner-state by measuring the survival of a reference entangled pair.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: only probabilistic pair sources, linear-optical Bell measurements, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors\u2014no forbidden elements.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible target for a \u201clooped teleportation corner-state witness\u201d that simulates the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian around a 2\u00d72 plaquette and reads out the topological corner state via entanglement-swap fidelity:\n\nExplanation:\n1) We label four \u201clattice\u201d corners A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3 and an external reference qubit R=4.  \n2) We start with a reference Bell pair (R\u2013A) created by Source_REF \u2192 modes [4,0].  \n3) Four additional probabilistic Bell sources implement the plaquette edges:\n     \u2022 Source_AB \u2192 [0,1] (hopping t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_BC \u2192 [1,2] (t\u2082)\n     \u2022 Source_CD \u2192 [2,3] (t\u2081)\n     \u2022 Source_DA \u2192 [3,0] (t\u2082)  \n   We insert tunable phase shifters \u03c6\u2093 on edges AB and CD, and \u03c6_y on edges BC and DA to simulate the alternating intra\u2010/inter\u2010cell hoppings of the BBH model.  \n4) We perform four sequential Bell\u2010state measurements (linear-optical analyzers + photon counters) along the loop A\u2192B, B\u2192C, C\u2192D, D\u2192A\u2014and finally re-teleport the qubit back to mode 0.

    "output": "Thought:\nStep 1: We need a network-only Pytheus target (no pure state generation) that ties together a Bloch Hamiltonian and its \u201ccorner state\u201d into an entanglement-swapping/teleportation protocol.  \nStep 2: I propose a \u201ctopological entanglement tomography\u201d on a 2\u00d72 plaquette: start with a reference Bell pair between R and corner A, then perform four sequential Bell-swap measurements around the square (edges AB, BC, CD, DA) whose beam-splitter reflectivities alternate (r\u2081 on AB & CD, r\u2082 on BC & DA) to simulate the BBH quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian.  At the end we measure R\u2019s correlation with each corner (A, B, C, D) in separate runs.  Sweeping (r\u2081,r\u2082) yields a two-dimensional entanglement\u2010map: in the trivial regime entanglement remains at A; in the topological regime it \u201cpumps\u201d onto the opposite corner C (or D/B), directly witnessing the fractional corner state.  This network can be generalized to larger lattices, multi\u2010step loops, and higher\u2010order invariants.  \nStep 3: Novelty: Pytheus has never designed a network that 1) simulates a 2D quadrupole Bloch Hamiltonian via alternating-coupling Bell swaps, and 2) tomographically maps entanglement onto all four corners to detect corner localization.  \nStep 4: Feasibility: uses one reference PDC source, four link PDC sources, four static-reflectivity BS\u2019s as Bell analyzers, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics, probabilistic sources, and no-feedback capabilities.  \nStep 5: This idea yields a convincing theory paper: it opens a family of \u201centanglement-pump\u201d networks probing higher-order topology purely via measured correlations.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\n{\n  description: \"Topological entanglement tomography on a 2\u00d72 plaquette \u2192 simulate BBH quadrupole model by sequential Bell swaps with alternating couplings and map corner-state entanglement\",\n  foldername: \"topo_ent_tomo\",\n  single_emitters: [],\n  # Photon-pair sources:\n  #   REF \u2192 [4,0]     (R\u2013A reference Bell pair)\n  #   AB  \u2192 [0,1]     (edge A\u2013B, reflectivity r1)\n  #   BC  \u2192 [1,2]     (edge B\u2013C, reflectivity r2)\n  #   CD  \u2192 [2,3]     (edge C\u2013D, reflectivity r1)\n  #   DA  \u2192 [3,0]     (edge D\u2013A, reflectivity r2)\n  removed_connections: [[4,1],[4,2],[4,3]],\n  # Four Bell analyzers on edges AB, BC, CD, DA:\n  num_anc: 8,              # two detectors per analyzer\n  num_pre: 1,\n  reflectivities: [\"r1 on AB & CD\",\"r2 on BC & DA\"],\n  # In each corner-tomography run we read out R\u2013X parity for X\u2208{A=0,B=1,C=2,D=3}:\n  # target_quantum is the subspace of correlated clicks on [4,X]:\n  target_quantum: [\"00\",\"11\"],\n  # The Expert will perform four separate Pytheus optimizations, each with out_nodes:[4,X],\n  # scanning (r1,r2) to map the entanglement distribution.\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  tries_per_edge: 5,\n  thresholds: [0.3,0.1],\n  number_resolving: true\n}"
