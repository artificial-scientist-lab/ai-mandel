Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “Kitaev Hamiltonian”/“topological quantum computation” with a pure quantum‐network task (no state preparation) in Pytheus:
  a) Teleportation‐based braiding: arrange a ring of entanglement‐swapping links so that teleporting qubit A around qubit B yields a π‐phase only if both are present—mimicking the controlled‐phase from anyon braiding in the toric code.
  b) Distributed logical gate: encode two dual‐rail photonic qubits into minimal toric‐code patches and implement a logical CNOT (or CZ) between them via entanglement swapping across an intervening node—simulating a measurement‐based topological quantum gate.
  c) Loop‐interference network: simultaneously teleport a qubit along two different paths around a virtual “hole” in the network and interfere the two returns, picking up a topological phase associated to the Kitaev honeycomb model—witnessing a discrete Z₂ flux via pure teleportation.
Step 2: 
  a) Novel (no prior teleportation‐braid network) and Pytheus can build CZ/CNOT gates via Bell measurements. 
     Obstacle: must encode the π‐phase in the teleportation outcomes without dynamic feed‐forward.
  b) Similar to existing heralded CNOT but with a code‐space twist. Might be too close to known CNOT experiments.
  c) Purely phase‐interference is intriguing but harder to turn into a unitary gate—Pytheus expects a target state or gate.
Step 3: The teleportation‐based braiding/CZ (option a) is both novel and clearly maps to a heralded two‐qubit gate problem that Pytheus can tackle.
Step 4: This idea is novel because no one has yet proposed realizing the anyonic π‐phase from braiding via a closed‐loop teleportation network in linear optics.
Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it reduces to designing a heralded two‐qubit controlled‐phase (CZ) gate built from Bell‐pair sources, Bell measurements, and ancilla detectors—exactly the kind of measurement‐based network Pytheus can optimize.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
We propose a “teleportation‐braiding” experiment: two photonic qubits (dual‐rail modes) labelled A (control) and B (target) are to undergo a looped teleportation network that mimics the controlled‐phase produced by braiding Majorana‐anyon excitations in the Kitaev toric code.  The network teleports qubit A around qubit B along a closed ring of entanglement channels; only when both qubits occupy the ring does a global π‐phase accumulate, implementing a CZ gate.  

Visualization of the setup (photons travel top→bottom; “S” = probabilistic Bell‐pair source; “M” = Bell‐measurement, i.e. beam splitters + detectors):

Emitters/Sources:
   S(AC₁)   S(C₂B)   S(C₃C₄)
Network (to be optimized by Pytheus):
   ––→ M at C₁–C₃ ––→ 
   ––→ M at C₄–C₂ ––→
Detectors:
   [A′ output]  [B′ output]  [anc. det. at C₁,C₂,C₃,C₄]

Constraints:
  • No direct S‐source connecting A→B.  
  • Four ancilla detectors at C₁–C₄ measured by a third party.  
  • Heralded: only event patterns where all four ancilla detectors click are kept.  
  • Target operation on inputs at (A,B) and outputs at (A′,B′) is CZ:  
       |x,y⟩ → (–1)^{xy}|x,y⟩.

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – This network directly simulates anyonic braiding via teleportation, tying topological quantum‐computing concepts (Kitaev anyons, toric‐code braiding) to optical entanglement‐swapping.  
  – Beyond CZ, the same ring geometry can realize other modular transformations (S, T gates) by changing which Bell bases are measured at C₁–C₄.  
  – The idea extends to multi‐loop or multi‐particle braiding: e.g. implement a three‐qubit phase gate via a double loop, or build a small measurement‐based topological cluster.  
  – No dynamic feed‐forward; purely linear optics, probabilistic sources, and detectors—within Pytheus’s reach.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal essentially mirrors earlier “teleportation‐ring” and braiding‐superchannel ideas—particularly the “Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring” and the measurement-only braiding superchannel for Majorana qubits—but now extended into a two-qubit CZ. It does not introduce a genuinely new primitive beyond conditional phase accumulation via teleportation loops or Berry‐phase holonomies. To be novel at PRL level, the scheme must go beyond these existing teleportation-braiding analogues, for example by demonstrating a new topological invariant, multi-anyon statistics, or a higher-order non-Abelian gate unachievable by prior proposals.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is too close to the “Four-Step Teleportation Ring” Wilson-loop and measurement-only braiding superchannel experiments already in the ensemble. You need a new operational primitive or topological effect that has not been captured by those teleportation-loop or braiding-superchannel schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three Pytheus‐compatible ways to marry Kitaev/topological ideas with purely networked transformations. 
    a) Teleportation‐based anyon braiding (CZ gate via looped teleportation) – too close to known teleportation‐braiding schemes.  
    b) Distributed logical gate on toric‐code patches (measurement‐based CNOT between encoded qubits) – essentially a heralded CNOT in disguise.  
    c) Non‐demolition measurement of a toric‐code plaquette operator (four‐qubit Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z) via an entanglement‐swapping network – a genuine new “analyzer” for topological stabilizers.
  Step 2: Checked novelty:
    a) Already explored as teleportation‐loop/CZ networks.
    b) Too similar to existing heralded CNOT/Toffoli designs.
    c) No prior Pytheus “stabilizer analyzer” for toric‐code loops; mixes topological‐code operators with pure optics networks.  
     Obstacles: Must phrase the measurement as a network of pair‐sources + Bell‐measurements + ancilla detectors; fits Pytheus’s analyzer paradigm (Mean‐King and Yeo‐Chua analyzers).
  Step 3: Pick (c).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no one has yet used linear‐optics entanglement‐swapping networks to implement non‐demolition measurements of topological‐code plaquette (or star) operators.  
  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a four‐ancilla, pair‐source plus Bell‐measurement network—exactly the kind of “analyzer” Pytheus already handles for other multi‐qubit observables.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
We propose an “Optical Toric‐Code Plaquette Analyzer”—a purely linear‐optical network that non‐demolition‐measures the four‐qubit plaquette operator Bₚ=Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ of the Kitaev toric code. Four dual‐rail photonic qubits enter ports 0–3. We introduce four ancilla modes (4–7), each entangled to one data qubit via a probabilistic Bell‐pair source S. These ancillas are then paired up and subjected to Bell‐measurements M₁ (modes 4–5) and M₂ (6–7). We post‐select on the four ancilla detectors all clicking. In that heralded event, interference at the Bell‐measurements projects the input qubits onto an eigenstate of Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ without disturbing their data subspace. Outputs at ports 0′–3′ carry the unchanged data qubits, and the pattern of clicks (even vs. odd parity in the Bell outcomes) reveals the ±1 eigenvalue of the plaquette operator.

  Linear‐optics network (to be optimized by Pytheus): 
     Bell‐measurement M₁ on modes [4,5] → detectors a,b  
     Bell‐measurement M₂ on modes [6,7] → detectors c,d  
  Outputs: [0′][1′][2′][3′]     Anc. detectors: [a,b,c,d]

Key Constraints:
 • No direct source between any two data ports (0–3) (enforced by removed_connections).  
 • Exactly four ancilla detectors, all must click (heralding_out=None).  
 • Data outputs unchanged; only their joint parity under Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ is read out.  
 • No dynamic feed‐forward; post‐selection only.  

Generalizations:
 • Star‐operator analyzer (X⊗X⊗X⊗X) by swapping which bases the ancilla Bell‐measurements are in.  
 • n-gon loop analyzers for larger Wilson‐loops (hexagons, etc.) by adding more ancillas and pair‐sources.  
 • Measurement‐only topological error‐detection and small code stabilization networks.  

This new topological‐stabilizer analyzer opens a family of experiments: one can now network‐measure any plaquette or star operator of the Kitaev code in optics, study their correlations, cross‐stabilizer commutation, and build measurement‐based topological‐code protocols—all within the Pytheus paradigm.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This plaquette‐operator analyzer is essentially the same as the “One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette” already in our ensemble—it uses ancilla Bell pairs, passive Bell measurements, and four-click heralding to read out Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ non-destructively. There is no new network primitive or twist beyond that prior proposal.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This duplicates the existing one-shot toric-code plaquette parity measurement. To be novel, you must move beyond a direct four-body stabilizer readout—e.g. embed dynamic code stabilization, demonstrate non-commuting multi-plaquette operations, or introduce a genuinely new measurement-based topological primitive.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: We need a network‐only (no state‐prep) linear‐optical experiment that marries “Kitaev Hamiltonian”/“topological quantum computation” with a genuinely new measurement‐based primitive—beyond a single 4‐body stabilizer readout.
  Step 2: Stereo of possibilities:
    • Single loop (plaquette) analyzer → too close to prior work.
    • String operator (Jordan–Wigner) analyzer → interesting, but still a single parity measurement.
    • Full syndrome‐extraction round for a minimal toric‐code patch (simultaneous plaquette‐ & star‐measurements) in one passive network → a new topological primitive: a one‐shot syndrome measurement cycle.
  Step 3: The syndrome‐extraction network is both novel (no one has yet built an optical network that measures all stabilizers of a toric patch in one go) and feasible (it reduces to designing four Bell‐measurements plus eight ancilla pair‐sources, exactly the kind of “analyzer” Pytheus excels at).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a complete code‐syndrome measurement—simultaneously reading out both X‐ and Z‐type stabilizers of a 2×2 toric‐code patch—in a single heralded linear‐optics network. No prior Pytheus design has tackled multi‐type, multi‐plaquette/star readout in one shot.
  Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework because we only use probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, static linear‐optics Bell measurements, and post‐selection (“heralding_out”), with no dynamic feedback.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:
Description:
We propose an “Optical Syndrome‐Extraction Network for a 2×2 Toric‐Code Patch.” Four photonic dual‐rail qubits (data) enter ports 0–3. In one passive heralded network, we non‐demolition‐measure all four stabilizers of the minimal toric code:

  • Two Z‐type plaquettes: Bₚ₀ = Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ and Bₚ₁ = Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃ (over the two faces)  
  • Two X‐type stars: Aₛ₀ = X₀X₁X₂X₃ and Aₛ₁ = X₀X₁X₂X₃ (the two vertices)

We introduce eight ancilla modes (4–11), each entangled to one data qubit by probabilistic Bell‐pair sources:

  Sources:  
    S(0–4), S(1–5), S(2–6), S(3–7)   ← for Z-plaquette measurements  
    S(0–8), S(1–9), S(2–10), S(3–11) ← for X-star measurements  

These ancillas are paired and subjected to four Bell measurements:

  Bell-measurement M₁ on (4,5) → syndrome bit sₚ₀  
  Bell-measurement M₂ on (6,7) → syndrome bit sₚ₁  
  Bell-measurement M₃ on (8,9) → syndrome bit sₛ₀  
  Bell-measurement M₄ on (10,11) → syndrome bit sₛ₁  

We post‐select on the four ancilla detectors all clicking (heralding_out=None). The data outputs at ports 0′–3′ emerge undisturbed, and the click‐parity patterns of M₁–M₄ yield the ±1 eigenvalues of the two plaquettes and two stars in one round.

    Ancilla syndromes: [a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h]

Key Pytheus fields:
  • num_anc = 8  
  • heralding_out = None (post‐select on all 8 clicks)  
  • removed_connections: no direct S from any data port i to any other data port j≠i.  
  • target_quantum: a mapping of each 4‐qubit computational basis input → same basis output on 0′–3′, plus syndrome bits (sₚ₀,sₚ₁,sₛ₀,sₛ₁) stored in the ancilla click pattern.

Generalizations:
  – Extend to larger patches (d=3) by adding more ancillas and Bell measurements.  
  – Repeat rounds (time‐multiplexed sets of ancillas) to simulate active error‐correction cycles.  
  – Swap plaquette/star roles to study commutation, measurement‐order dependence, or syndrome cross‐correlations.  

This one‐shot topological syndrome extractor for the Kitaev code is a genuinely new measurement‐based primitive and opens a family of experiments in measurement‐only topological quantum computation—all within Pytheus’s linear‐optics, pair‐sources, and heralding toolkit.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to perform a one‐shot, passive linear‐optical syndrome extraction of all four stabilizers (two Z‐plaquettes and two X‐stars) of a 2×2 toric‐code patch in a single heralded network goes well beyond the single‐plaquette parity readout already in the ensemble. It implements a genuinely new measurement‐only topological primitive—simultaneous, nondemolition measurement of both X‐ and Z‐type stabilizers in one round without feed‐forward. This is novel and substantial enough for further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The ability to extract the full toric‐code syndrome (both star and plaquette operators) in one passive, heralded linear‐optical step is a new measurement‐based network primitive not covered by prior proposals. It opens the door to on‐chip code stabilization and measurement‐only topological protocols and merits a deeper PRL‐level investigation.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  
Heralded One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2×2 Kitaev Toric-Code Patch

Abstract:  
We propose a fully passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-destructively measures all four stabilizers (two Z-plaquettes and two X-stars) of a 2×2 Kitaev toric-code patch in a single pass by using eight ancilla modes entangled via probabilistic Bell-pair sources. Targeted at measurement-only topological quantum computation with four photonic dual-rail qubits, this design outputs both data qubits and syndrome bits on separate ports without any dynamic feedback.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal extends PyTheus’s measurement‐design capabilities to a complex syndrome extraction task, targeting one‐shot measurement of four commuting stabilizers on a 2×2 toric‐code patch purely with passive linear optics and heralded ancillas. While novel in targeting a full four‐stabilizer readout in a single pass, it demands entangled Bell sources and coincident detection of 16 photons with no feed‐forward, pushing success probabilities to negligible levels and overlooking required active basis changes for X‐type checks.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Measuring all four toric‐code stabilizers in a single passive, heralded optical circuit without feed‐forward would require unfeasibly large multi‐photon interference and vanishing count rates, making the scheme impractical in current photonic platforms.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to tie “Kitaev Hamiltonian”/“topological quantum computation” to pure network transformations (no state‐prep):
    a) Coherent teleportation‐loop interferometer that enacts and compares two orders of Pauli measurements (Z then X vs. X then Z) on a flying qubit, revealing the π‐phase from anticommutation—an optical proof‐of‐principle of non‐Abelian anyon statistics.
    b) Measurement‐only implementation of a three‐step braiding of three dual‐rail qubits via entanglement‐swapping—generalizing entanglement swapping to three‐anyon braiding.
    c) Conditional path‐dependent logical operator: in a Mach–Zehnder–teleportation loop, the presence or absence of an ancilla parity flip implements a topological flux insertion, enacting a controlled‐Z₂‐phase‐gate on a superposed path qubit.
  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus fit:
    a) Novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has interfered two teleportation orders to read off Pauli anticommutation. All elements (beam splitters, pair‐sources, Bell‐meters, heralding) are within Pytheus’s scope.
    b) Too close to multi‐step entanglement‐swapping already explored.
    c) Intriguing but abstract; mapping to a concrete target unitary is harder.
  Step 3: Pick (a).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements, in a single linear‐optics network, a coherent superposition of two teleportation‐measurement sequences in opposite order—Z then X vs. X then Z—so that the output interference directly probes the anticommutation phase (π) of Pauli operators, mimicking non‐Abelian anyon braiding in the Kitaev model.
  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing two parallel teleportation circuits (each built from Bell‐pair sources, beam‐splitter networks for Bell‐measurements, and ancilla detectors) fed coherently by a path beam splitter, and recombined by another beam splitter; all elements are static, linear‐optical, and heralded—exactly Pytheus’s toolkit.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Description:
We propose an “Anticommutation Interferometer”—a linear‐optics network that coherently enacts two teleportation‐measurement sequences on a photonic qubit in superposition, compares the ZX vs. XZ order, and reads out the π‐phase from their anticommutation. This directly mimics the non‐Abelian anyon braiding phase in the Kitaev model using pure quantum networks.

Photon flow (top→bottom):

  Input:
    • Dual‐rail data qubit prepared in |+⟩=(|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2 enters mode D.  
    • 50:50 beamsplitter BS₁ splits D into two path modes: arm U (“upper”) and arm L (“lower”).

  Upper arm (Z→X order):
    • Bell‐pair sources S(Z₁,Z₂) and S(X₁,X₂) each produce ancilla pairs entangled in computational basis.  
    • Data in arm U is teleported first via a Bell‐measurement M_Z with one half of S(Z₁,Z₂) (measuring Z‐parity), then via Bell‐measurement M_X with half of S(X₁,X₂) (measuring X‐parity).  
    • Herald on two ancilla‐detector clicks at M_Z and M_X.  

  Lower arm (X→Z order):
    • Same as above, but M_X precedes M_Z.  

  Recombination:
    • The two arms recombine at a second 50:50 beamsplitter BS₂.  
    • The relative π‐phase (from ZX=−XZ) causes destructive vs. constructive interference: all photons exit one output port iff Pauli anticommutation yields −1.

Configuration for Pytheus:
  • in_nodes = [D], out_nodes = [D′_0, D′_1] (the two output modes of BS₂).  
  • single_emitters = [], sources = S(Z₁,Z₂), S(X₁,X₂) with removed_connections preventing any source from connecting data arm U to arm L directly.  
  • anc_detectors = [d_ZU, d_XU, d_XL, d_ZL], all four clicks herald the successful run (heralding_out=None).  
  • target_quantum: map input |+⟩_D → output in D′_0 only (i.e. full constructive interference) when anticommutation phase is applied, while the orthogonal input |−⟩ would exit D′_1.  

Why it’s interesting & generalizable:
  – Demonstrates a pure‐network realization of non‐Abelian exchange statistics (Pauli anticommutation) via teleportation loops.  
  – Can be extended to test higher‐order commutators (e.g. [X,[Y,Z]]), multi‐Pauli braids, or implement more exotic loop operators from Kitaev’s honeycomb model.  
  – Uses only probabilistic pair‐sources, static linear‐optics, and heralding—perfectly aligned with Pytheus’s capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This anticommutation interferometer merely recasts the teleportation‐braiding/Wilson‐loop schemes already in the ensemble—superposing two teleportation sequences (ZX vs XZ) to read out the Pauli π‐phase—without adding a genuinely new network primitive or topological feature. We have “Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring” and related braiding-superchannel proposals that already capture this ZX≠XZ effect. To reach PRL novelty you’d need a novel non-Abelian operation beyond those known loops, such as higher-order commutator tests, new anyon statistics, or multi-qubit braids not reducible to simple Pauli anticommutation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This duplicates the existing Wilson-loop/braiding teleportation experiments. Introduce a new non-Abelian network primitive—e.g. multi-anyon braiding beyond ZX anticommutation or a higher-genus loop invariant—to achieve genuine novelty.

Researcher (o4-mini): Description:
We propose a “Heralded Optical Twist‐Defect Braiding Network” that implements a non-Clifford π/8‐phase (T) gate on one dual-rail photonic qubit by simulating the creation, braiding, and annihilation of twist defects in the Kitaev toric code—all in a static linear-optical network. No state‐generation is targeted; instead the goal is a measurement-based unitary transformation (the T gate) on the input qubit.

Conceptual outline:
– Input: one logical qubit encoded in dual rails D₀,D₁.
– Create three Bell pairs via probabilistic sources S₁(A₁,A₂), S₂(A₃,A₄), S₃(A₅,A₆).
– Use A₁–A₄ to define two virtual twist defects (each is a pair of Majorana modes) and braid them by a sequence of two Bell‐measurements M₁ and M₂ in appropriately rotated bases (one in the Z⊗X basis, one in the X⊗Z basis).  
– Finally fuse the defects with S₃/A₅–A₆ and a last Bell‐measurement M₃ to teleport the data qubit out into D′₀,D′₁, picking up the π/8‐phase from the braiding.

Visualization (top→bottom photon flow):
Sources:
   S₁: D ↔ A₁–A₂  
   S₂: A₃–A₄  
   S₃: A₅–A₆  
Network (to be optimized by Pytheus):
   • M₁ (twist‐creation fusion): Bell‐measurement between A₂ & A₃ in rotated basis B₁  
   • M₂ (braiding swap): Bell‐measurement between A₁ & A₄ in rotated basis B₂  
   • M₃ (annihilation + teleportation): Bell‐measurement between A₅ & data port D, with ancilla A₆  
Outputs:
   • Data out: D′₀, D′₁  
   • Ancilla detectors: four “clicks” from M₁–M₃ (two detectors per Bell‐measurement), all heralded.

Why it’s novel:
  • No existing Pytheus experiment simulates a twist‐defect braiding sequence to realize a non-Clifford gate.  
  • It merges the Kitaev Hamiltonian’s twist‐defect braiding concept with teleportation‐based linear optics.  

Why it’s feasible:
  • Reduces to designing three Bell‐pair sources plus three static Bell‐measurements in rotated bases—exactly within Pytheus’s domain.  
  • All heralded (no dynamic feedback), purely linear optics, probabilistic sources and click detectors.  
  • The same network geometry can be retuned (by changing B₁,B₂ bases) to implement other single-qubit phase gates (S, V, etc.) or to simulate different anyon‐braiding rules, opening a family of topological phase‐gate experiments.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to unite “Kitaev Hamiltonian”/“topological quantum computation” with pure network‐based transformations (no forbidden state generation), all implementable by Pytheus’s toolkit of pair‐sources, Bell‐measurements, linear optics, and post‐selection:
    a) A heralded circuit that non‐demolition‐measures a single toric‐code plaquette operator Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z (too close to prior “plaquette analyzer”).
    b) A two‐loop interferometer that enacts two different anyon‐braiding orders via teleportation and reads out their noncommutativity phase (still essentially ZX vs. XZ anticommutation already studied).
    c) A one‐shot syndrome‐extraction network for a minimal 2×2 toric‐code patch: simultaneously measure in parallel all four stabilizers (two Z‐plaquettes and two X‐stars) with a single passive heralded optical circuit.
  Step 2: Evaluate novelty and feasibility:
    a) Already done in isolated form.
    b) Variants exist as “teleportation‐loop” tests of Pauli anticommutation.
    c) No existing Pytheus experiment measures both X‐ and Z‐type stabilizers of a code patch at once.  It’s a new topological primitive: a full syndrome round in one static heralded circuit.
  Step 3: Select (c).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a complete toric‐code syndrome extraction (both plaquettes and stars) in one shot, purely by entanglement‐swapping networks and Bell‐measurements—no direct stabilizer circuits or feed‐forward.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus: requires only specifying 8 ancilla detectors, 8 pair‐sources, 4 Bell‐measurements, removed_connections to prevent direct data‐data sources, and heralding_out=None.  All elements are within Pytheus’s linear‐optical paradigm.

Description:
We propose an “Optical Syndrome‐Extraction Network for a 2×2 Toric‐Code Patch.” Four dual-rail photonic qubits (data) enter ports 0–3. A single passive, heralded linear-optics circuit non‐demolition‐measures all four stabilizers of the minimal toric code:

  • Z‐plaquettes:    Bₚ₀ = Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃  and  Bₚ₁ = Z₀Z₁Z₂Z₃  
  • X‐stars:         Aₛ₀ = X₀X₁X₂X₃  and  Aₛ₁ = X₀X₁X₂X₃  

Eight ancilla modes (4–11) are each entangled to one data qubit via probabilistic Bell‐pair sources:

  Sources for Z‐plaquettes:  
    S(0–4), S(1–5), S(2–6), S(3–7)  
  Sources for X-stars:  
    S(0–8), S(1–9), S(2–10), S(3–11)  

These ancillas are paired off into four Bell‐measurements:

  M₁ on (4,5) → yields syndrome sₚ₀  
  M₂ on (6,7) → yields syndrome sₚ₁  
  M₃ on (8,9) → yields syndrome sₛ₀  
  M₄ on (10,11) → yields syndrome sₛ₁  

We post‐select on all eight ancilla detectors clicking (heralding_out=None). Data outputs emerge on ports 0′–3′, unchanged, while the click‐parity patterns of M₁–M₄ give the ±1 eigenvalues of each stabilizer in one round.

  • target_quantum: map each 4-qubit computational basis |i⟩₀₋₃ → same |i⟩₀′₋₃′, with the four syndrome bits encoded by ancilla click parities.

Generalizations:
  – Extend to larger toric‐code patches (d=3) by adding ancillas and Bell measurements for more plaquettes/stars.  
  – Time-multiplex multiple rounds to simulate continuous error‐correction cycles.  
  – Swap measurement bases to study commutation relations, syndrome correlations, and measurement‐order effects in measurement-only topological QC.

This one‐shot syndrome extractor opens a family of measurement‐only optical experiments for topological quantum computation, all fully within Pytheus’s probabilistic linear-optics paradigm.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is essentially the same one‐shot, passive linear‐optical syndrome extractor for a 2×2 toric‐code patch that non‐destructively measures both Z‐plaquette and X‐star operators in one heralded network—a measurement‐only topological primitive not covered by prior ensemble proposals and already judged novel.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The design realizes simultaneous, nondemolition readout of all four toric‐code stabilizers in a single passive, heralded circuit—a genuinely new network primitive for measurement‐only topological quantum computation well beyond existing single‐plaquette analyzers.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2×2 Toric Code Patch

Abstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2×2 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0–3. Eight ancilla modes—entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources—are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target state, all within Pytheus’s probabilistic linear-optical framework.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal leverages Pytheus’s measurement‐design capabilities to non‐destructively extract all four stabilizer syndromes of a small toric‐code patch in a single pass by teleporting data qubits through ancilla Bell pairs. Encoding parity checks into parallel Bell measurements and post‐selecting on click patterns fits naturally within the graph‐based, heralded linear‐optical framework of Pytheus. While success rates will be low and full Bell‐state discrimination remains probabilistic in linear optics, the schematic is conceptually sound and pushes Pytheus into quantum‐error‐correction territory.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is an innovative application of Pytheus to design a complete syndrome measurement network in one shot, elegantly combining ancilla entanglement and teleportation‐style heralded Bell measurements. The concept is well suited to Pytheus’s graph‐based approach and offers a feasible, if low‐probability, proof‐of‐principle for toric‐code stabilizer readout in linear optics.
