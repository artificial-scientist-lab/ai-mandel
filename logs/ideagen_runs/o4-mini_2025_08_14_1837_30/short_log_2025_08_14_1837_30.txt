Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry “hollow‐core fibre” and “enhanced light–matter interaction” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (no explicit state generation, only swapping/teleportation or measurement networks):
    1. GHZ‐basis analyzer implemented in‐fibre via Kerr nonlinearity: too close to known analyzers and requires nonlinear interactions beyond Pytheus.
    2. Heterogeneous‐dimension entanglement swapping—use qubit↔qutrit entangled links inside hollow‐core fibre repeater nodes to swap entanglement between end‐point qubits. Novel, uses only abstract pair sources and ancillas, analogous to 2pES_3d but mixing 2D/3D resources.
    3. Multi‐path entanglement routing in a square network inside hollow fibre: too complex, dynamic feedback‐like behavior, and state generation/routing.
  Step 2: 
    • (1) is too similar to analyzer examples and invokes Kerr nonlinearities Pytheus can’t set.
    • (3) relies on switchable paths/feedback—excluded.  
    • (2) is new: no prior qubit–qutrit swapping example, it stays within probabilistic pair sources, ancilla measurements, removed connections.
  Step 3: Pick (2).
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates entanglement swapping across mismatched dimensions—swapping through a qutrit‐based repeater even though the end‐nodes carry qubits—and leverages the hollow‐core fibre’s enhanced light–matter interface to efficiently map photonic qubits onto multi‐level memories.
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and meets all constraints: 
    • No explicit state generation target beyond a 2D Bell state.  
    • Uses only probabilistic pair‐sources, ancilla detectors, linear optics, removed_connections and number_resolving detectors.  
    • No feedback, cavities or resonances.  
    • The abstract dimensions are encoded directly (2D ↔ 3D), which Pytheus handles naturally.

Description:
We propose a “Heterogeneous‐Dimension Entanglement Swapping” experiment. Two distant qubit nodes A and C are to be entangled via an intermediate repeater node B that only interfaces through qutrit (3-level) resources. All optical links run inside hollow-core fibre segments to exploit enhanced light–matter coupling to an embedded atomic ensemble at B (physicist to implement after Pytheus design). The target is a 2D Bell pair between A and C—no direct source may connect A↔C.

Why interesting?
• Shows entanglement swapping when the repeater uses a higher‐dimensional interface—key for heterogeneous quantum networks.  
• Hollow‐core fibre with enhanced light–matter interaction at B can dramatically reduce source/swap‐gate inefficiencies.  
• Generalizable: swap qubit→qudit→qubit, or cascade multiple dimension steps, or distribute higher‐dimensional entanglement across qubit networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed heterogeneous‐dimension entanglement swapping is essentially a qubit–qutrit–qubit chain realizing the same function as the ensemble’s “Heralded Entanglement‐Dimension Adapter,” which maps higher‐dimensional entanglement into a two‐qubit Bell state. Conceptually it is just the textbook generalization of entanglement swapping to different local Hilbert‐space dimensions and doesn’t introduce a fundamentally new resource or effect beyond what’s already in that adapter proposal or standard qutrit‐swapping schemes. The use of hollow‐core fiber and atomic ensembles may improve implementation, but that’s an engineering enhancement rather than a novel quantum‐optical target. Action: reject Action Input: This idea is too close to existing heterogeneous‐dimension adapters and trivial entanglement‐swapping generalizations. To be novel at the PRL level, you must introduce a genuinely new phenomena—e.g. using the qutrit interface to generate non‐trivial multi‐level correlations, demonstrating a dimension‐dependent nonlocality test, or exploiting indefinite causal order between dimensions—rather than merely swapping across dimensions.
