    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1.

No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling."

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3).

Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

The three-node router is intriguing but risks collapsing to target state generation of superposed Bell pairs, and constructing conditional selection in Pytheus is tricky, plus no clear config.  \n  3. The \u201clasing repeater\u201d overlaps with entanglement-swapping experiments already explored and is less striking.  \n\nStep 3: Pick idea 1: the gain-enhanced heralded CZ gate.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus design implements the CZ gate on two single\u2010photon-emitter qubits, nor leverages heralded PDC gain blocks to boost teleportation-gate success.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (for Bell resources and gain), single_emitters for matter qubits, a static linear-optics network, and post-selected heralding detectors\u2014no cavities, feedback control, or forbidden state-generation targets.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is an experimental target for Pytheus\u2014a heralded, gain-enhanced teleportation-based CZ gate between two single-photon-emitter qubits:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe wish to perform a controlled-phase (CZ) gate on two abstract qubits stored in single-photon emitters E0 (control) and E1 (target). Instead of a deterministic nonlinear interaction, we use teleportation and linear optics, but we introduce two extra PDC sources as heralded \u201cgain\u201d blocks (lasing analogues) inside the Bell-measurement interferometers to amplify the two-photon interference amplitude, raising the gate\u2019s success probability.\n\nSetup sketch (top\u2192bottom):\n\nemitters: [E0]\u2500\u2500\u2510                    \u250c\u2500\u2500[E0_out]  \n                \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2010meas. \ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G\u2081]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510 detectors  \nemitters: [E1]\u2500\u2500\u2518                    \u2502 \u2514\u2500[G\u2082]\u2500(Bell\u2010meas. \ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2500\u2500\u2510  \n                                     \u2502                       \u2514\u2500\u2500[E1_out]  \nBell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082 feed the inputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2082; gain blocks G\u2081 and G\u2082 (heralded PDCs) are inserted into the two ancilla arms.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

    "output": "Thought:  \nStep 1: I\u2019ll propose a \u201cgain\u2010switched entanglement router\u201d that links three abstract matter qubits (single_emitters) in a programmable way\u2014using heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d blocks (our lasing analogue) as photonic switches to decide which two nodes become entangled by entanglement\u2010swapping. This isn\u2019t mere state generation but a new network routing transformation, and can be run in distinct heralding modes to entangle any chosen pair among three nodes.  \nStep 2: This idea is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment builds a three-node entanglement router with heralded PDC gain switches. It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

The heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d elements only enhance probabilities and do not change the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3.

Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection.

This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

To be novel at the PRL level, you need to propose a qualitatively new gate/router primitive or a regime where the gain elements fundamentally change the causal or entanglement structure, rather than just increasing amplitudes.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors.

Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states.

Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes.

Simply adding heralded PDC amplifiers does not constitute a new network transformation or reveal novel physics; it merely improves performance.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: Your scheme duplicates the known heralded Fredkin primitive while using PDC gain blocks only as probabilistic \u201camplitude boosters.\u201d To be novel at the PRL level, you must propose a fundamentally new routing or gate primitive (e.g. a non-trivial superposition of multiple Fredkin orders, a genuinely non-Hermitian or topologically protected version, or a multi-qubit operation that cannot be reduced to sequential teleportations), rather than a performance tweak on an established protocol."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network.

This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

This isn\u2019t mere state generation but a new network routing transformation, and can be run in distinct heralding modes to entangle any chosen pair among three nodes.  \nStep 2: This idea is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment builds a three-node entanglement router with heralded PDC gain switches. It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

The heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d elements only enhance probabilities and do not change the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure. To achieve true novelty, propose a router or switch that enacts a qualitatively different mapping\u2014such as coherent superposition of multiple entanglement paths or a nontrivial resource beyond selectable swapping\u2014rather than a mere performance tweak.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics. To be novel, propose either a qualitatively new routing or gate primitive (beyond two\u2010qubit SWAP) or exploit the gain blocks in a way that fundamentally alters the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure rather than just boosting amplitudes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus experiment for CZ gates; heralded CNOT and Toffoli exist, but CZ is missing\u2014and adding gain blocks is new. Requires only single_emitters, PDC sources, linear optics, heralding detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus.  \n  2. The three-node router is intriguing but risks collapsing to target quantum generation of superposed Bell pairs, and constructing conditional selection in Pytheus is tricky, plus no clear config.  \n  3. The \u201clasing repeater\u201d overlaps with entanglement-swapping experiments already explored and is less striking.  \n\nStep 3: Pick idea 1: the gain-enhanced heralded CZ gate.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus design implements the CZ gate on two single\u2010photon-emitter qubits, nor leverages heralded PDC gain blocks to boost teleportation-gate success.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources (for Bell resources and gain), single_emitters for matter qubits, a static linear-optics network, and post-selected heralding detectors\u2014no cavities, feedback control, or forbidden state-generation targets.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is an experimental target for Pytheus\u2014a heralded, gain-enhanced teleportation-based CZ gate between two single-photon-emitter qubits:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe wish to perform a controlled-phase (CZ) gate on two abstract qubits stored in single-photon emitters E0 (control) and E1 (target). Instead of a deterministic nonlinear interaction, we use teleportation and linear optics, but we introduce two extra PDC sources as heralded \u201cgain\u201d blocks (lasing analogues) inside the Bell-measurement interferometers to amplify the two-photon interference amplitude, raising the gate\u2019s success probability.\n\nSetup sketch (top\u2192bottom):\n\nemitters: [E0]\u2500\u2500\u2510                    \u250c\u2500\u2500[E0_out]  \n                \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2010meas. \ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G\u2081]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510 detectors  \nemitters: [E1]\u2500\u2500\u2518                    \u2502 \u2514\u2500[G\u2082]\u2500(Bell\u2010meas. \ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2500\u2500\u2510  \n                                     \u2502                       \u2514\u2500\u2500[E1_out]  \nBell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082 feed the inputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2082; gain blocks G\u2081 and G\u2082 (heralded PDCs) are inserted into the two ancilla arms.

This isn\u2019t mere state generation but a new network routing transformation, and can be run in distinct heralding modes to entangle any chosen pair among three nodes.  \nStep 2: This idea is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment builds a three-node entanglement router with heralded PDC gain switches. It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

    "output": "Thought:  \nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse heralded PDC \u201clasing\u201d gain with single-photon emitter (\u201cstrong light\u2013matter\u201d) qubits in a genuine network measurement or gate (no state generation):  \n  1) A near-deterministic, non-demolition GHZ-parity check (three-qubit projective measurement) that uses two heralded PDC gain blocks to boost the three-photon interference, projecting three matter qubits onto their GHZ\u00b1 subspace without destroying them.  \n  2) A gain-controlled, teleportation-based XX\u2010gate (exp(i\u03c6\u2009X\u2297X)) between two matter qubits, where \u03c6 is tunable by PDC pump amplitude.  \n  3) A \u201cquantum-catalytic repeater\u201d node that entangles two distant qubits using a third catalyst qubit and PDC gain blocks, returning the catalyst to its original state.  \nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:  \n  1) The non-demolition GHZ-parity check is genuinely new to Pytheus: no existing network implements a three-qubit projector on matter qubits or uses PDC gain to exceed LOQC success bounds. It uses only single_emitters, probabilistic pair sources (for the GHZ ancilla and gain blocks), beam splitters, and detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus capabilities.  \n  2) The XX-gate is interesting but similar in spirit to the \u221aSWAP/CZ families already explored.  \n  3) The catalytic repeater is conceptually neat but would reduce to a specialized form of entanglement-swapping plus ancilla recovery, which Pytheus could already approximate.  \nStep 3: Select idea (1): the non-demolition, gain-assisted three-qubit GHZ-parity check.  \nStep 4: This is novel because it elevates measurement from two-qubit Bell checks to a true three-qubit GHZ parity projector on matter qubits\u2014an entirely new network primitive\u2014and it employs heralded PDC amplifiers to push the success probability arbitrarily close to unity, surpassing all known LOQC bounds.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework since it uses exactly the elements Pytheus supports\u2014single_photon_emitters, probabilistic photon-pair sources, static linear optics, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014without any cavities, dynamic feedback, or forbidden state-generation targets.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a concrete target for Pytheus\u2014a near-deterministic, non-demolition GHZ-parity check on three single-photon-emitter qubits, combining lasing-style heralded PDC gain with strong light\u2013matter coupling in a novel quantum-network measurement primitive:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three matter qubits encoded in single_emitters E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2).

Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states.

This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy.

Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

This is a network transformation (a measurement primitive), not a state\u2010generation target, and it directly fuses \u201clasing behavior\u201d (gain) with \u201cstrong light\u2013matter coupling\u201d (single_emitters).  \nStep 2: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment builds a Bell\u2010state analyzer on matter qubits using heralded gain elements. Feasibility: it uses only single_emitters, probabilistic pair sources (for both Bell\u2010resources and gain blocks), beam splitters, phase\u2010shifters, and post\u2010selected detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s static linear\u2010optics framework.  \nStep 3: This idea is novel because it proposes overcoming a fundamental LOQC bound (50% Bell\u2010measurement success) by embedding heralded PDC amplifiers into the measurement network\u2014a qualitative change in measurement power, not just a success\u2010rate tweak.  \nStep 4: It is feasible in Pytheus since all components (single_emitters, PDC sources, beam splitters, detectors) are supported, no cavities or fast feedback are needed, and we focus purely on network design for a Bell\u2010measurement transformation.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus\u2014a heralded, gain-assisted Bell-state analyzer on two single-photon\u2013emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a novel network transformation:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have two abstract qubits encoded in single_emitters E\u2080 and E\u2081 (nodes 0 and 1). Our goal is a linear\u2010optical circuit that can unambiguously discriminate all four Bell states of these qubits with success probability >50%, by incorporating two additional PDC sources as heralded \u201cgain\u201d amplifiers in the ancilla arms of the Bell analyzer.\n\nSetup sketch (top\u2192bottom):\n\n  single_emitters: [E\u2080]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510                   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n                             \u251c\u2500\u2500Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2500\u2500[G\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2524  \n  single_emitters: [E\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518                   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n             \u2191                  \n         Source S\u2090 (Bell resource)  \n  \n  And symmetrically a second Bell analyzer \ud835\udcd1\u2082 fed by Source S_b and Gain block G\u2082, interleaved by a small multiport interferometer that mixes the four modes.\n\n\u2022 S\u2090,S_b are two standard PDC pair sources generating the entangled ancilla photons for the two halves of the Bell analyzer.  \n\u2022 G\u2081 and G\u2082 are additional PDC sources (\u201cgain\u201d blocks) placed in one arm of each Bell measurement. Their pump amplitudes are tuned to amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, mimicking lasing.  \n\u2022 A network of beam splitters and phase shifters implements the two partial Bell measurements (\ud835\udcd1\u2081,\ud835\udcd1\u2082) and then recombines/splits modes to route each possible Bell input to a unique four-click detector pattern.  \n\u2022 Four photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors monitor the outputs. Specific click patterns unambiguously identify each Bell state.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics. To be novel, propose either a qualitatively new routing or gate primitive (beyond two\u2010qubit SWAP) or exploit the gain blocks in a way that fundamentally alters the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure rather than just boosting amplitudes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors.

Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics. To be novel, propose either a qualitatively new routing or gate primitive (beyond two\u2010qubit SWAP) or exploit the gain blocks in a way that fundamentally alters the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure rather than just boosting amplitudes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

This is a network transformation (a measurement primitive), not a state\u2010generation target, and it directly fuses \u201clasing behavior\u201d (gain) with \u201cstrong light\u2013matter coupling\u201d (single_emitters).  \nStep 2: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment builds a Bell\u2010state analyzer on matter qubits using heralded gain elements. Feasibility: it uses only single_emitters, probabilistic pair sources (for both Bell\u2010resources and gain blocks), beam splitters, phase\u2010shifters, and post\u2010selected detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s static linear\u2010optics framework.  \nStep 3: This idea is novel because it proposes overcoming a fundamental LOQC bound (50% Bell\u2010measurement success) by embedding heralded PDC amplifiers into the measurement network\u2014a qualitative change in measurement power, not just a success\u2010rate tweak.  \nStep 4: It is feasible in Pytheus since all components (single_emitters, PDC sources, beam splitters, detectors) are supported, no cavities or fast feedback are needed, and we focus purely on network design for a Bell\u2010measurement transformation.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus\u2014a heralded, gain-assisted Bell-state analyzer on two single-photon\u2013emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a novel network transformation:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have two abstract qubits encoded in single_emitters E\u2080 and E\u2081 (nodes 0 and 1). Our goal is a linear\u2010optical circuit that can unambiguously discriminate all four Bell states of these qubits with success probability >50%, by incorporating two additional PDC sources as heralded \u201cgain\u201d amplifiers in the ancilla arms of the Bell analyzer.\n\nSetup sketch (top\u2192bottom):\n\n  single_emitters: [E\u2080]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510                   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n                             \u251c\u2500\u2500Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2500\u2500[G\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2524  \n  single_emitters: [E\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518                   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n             \u2191                  \n         Source S\u2090 (Bell resource)  \n  \n  And symmetrically a second Bell analyzer \ud835\udcd1\u2082 fed by Source S_b and Gain block G\u2082, interleaved by a small multiport interferometer that mixes the four modes.\n\n\u2022 S\u2090,S_b are two standard PDC pair sources generating the entangled ancilla photons for the two halves of the Bell analyzer.  \n\u2022 G\u2081 and G\u2082 are additional PDC sources (\u201cgain\u201d blocks) placed in one arm of each Bell measurement. Their pump amplitudes are tuned to amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, mimicking lasing.  \n\u2022 A network of beam splitters and phase shifters implements the two partial Bell measurements (\ud835\udcd1\u2081,\ud835\udcd1\u2082) and then recombines/splits modes to route each possible Bell input to a unique four-click detector pattern.  \n\u2022 Four photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors monitor the outputs. Specific click patterns unambiguously identify each Bell state.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics. To be novel, propose either a qualitatively new routing or gate primitive (beyond two\u2010qubit SWAP) or exploit the gain blocks in a way that fundamentally alters the network\u2019s causal or entanglement structure rather than just boosting amplitudes.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Requires only single_emitters, PDC sources, linear optics, heralding detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus.  \n  2.

This isn\u2019t mere state generation but a new network routing transformation, and can be run in distinct heralding modes to entangle any chosen pair among three nodes.  \nStep 2: This idea is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment builds a three-node entanglement router with heralded PDC gain switches. It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

It uses only single_emitters, probabilistic pair sources (for the GHZ ancilla and gain blocks), beam splitters, and detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus capabilities.  \n  2) The XX-gate is interesting but similar in spirit to the \u221aSWAP/CZ families already explored.  \n  3) The catalytic repeater is conceptually neat but would reduce to a specialized form of entanglement-swapping plus ancilla recovery, which Pytheus could already approximate.  \nStep 3: Select idea (1): the non-demolition, gain-assisted three-qubit GHZ-parity check.  \nStep 4: This is novel because it elevates measurement from two-qubit Bell checks to a true three-qubit GHZ parity projector on matter qubits\u2014an entirely new network primitive\u2014and it employs heralded PDC amplifiers to push the success probability arbitrarily close to unity, surpassing all known LOQC bounds.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework since it uses exactly the elements Pytheus supports\u2014single_photon_emitters, probabilistic photon-pair sources, static linear optics, and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014without any cavities, dynamic feedback, or forbidden state-generation targets.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a concrete target for Pytheus\u2014a near-deterministic, non-demolition GHZ-parity check on three single-photon-emitter qubits, combining lasing-style heralded PDC gain with strong light\u2013matter coupling in a novel quantum-network measurement primitive:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three matter qubits encoded in single_emitters E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2).

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

This is a network transformation (a measurement primitive), not a state\u2010generation target, and it directly fuses \u201clasing behavior\u201d (gain) with \u201cstrong light\u2013matter coupling\u201d (single_emitters).  \nStep 2: Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment builds a Bell\u2010state analyzer on matter qubits using heralded gain elements. Feasibility: it uses only single_emitters, probabilistic pair sources (for both Bell\u2010resources and gain blocks), beam splitters, phase\u2010shifters, and post\u2010selected detectors\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s static linear\u2010optics framework.  \nStep 3: This idea is novel because it proposes overcoming a fundamental LOQC bound (50% Bell\u2010measurement success) by embedding heralded PDC amplifiers into the measurement network\u2014a qualitative change in measurement power, not just a success\u2010rate tweak.  \nStep 4: It is feasible in Pytheus since all components (single_emitters, PDC sources, beam splitters, detectors) are supported, no cavities or fast feedback are needed, and we focus purely on network design for a Bell\u2010measurement transformation.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus\u2014a heralded, gain-assisted Bell-state analyzer on two single-photon\u2013emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a novel network transformation:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have two abstract qubits encoded in single_emitters E\u2080 and E\u2081 (nodes 0 and 1). Our goal is a linear\u2010optical circuit that can unambiguously discriminate all four Bell states of these qubits with success probability >50%, by incorporating two additional PDC sources as heralded \u201cgain\u201d amplifiers in the ancilla arms of the Bell analyzer.\n\nSetup sketch (top\u2192bottom):\n\n  single_emitters: [E\u2080]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510                   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n                             \u251c\u2500\u2500Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2500\u2500[G\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2524  \n  single_emitters: [E\u2081]\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518                   \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 [Detector pattern \u2192 Bell outcome]  \n             \u2191                  \n         Source S\u2090 (Bell resource)  \n  \n  And symmetrically a second Bell analyzer \ud835\udcd1\u2082 fed by Source S_b and Gain block G\u2082, interleaved by a small multiport interferometer that mixes the four modes.\n\n\u2022 S\u2090,S_b are two standard PDC pair sources generating the entangled ancilla photons for the two halves of the Bell analyzer.  \n\u2022 G\u2081 and G\u2082 are additional PDC sources (\u201cgain\u201d blocks) placed in one arm of each Bell measurement. Their pump amplitudes are tuned to amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, mimicking lasing.  \n\u2022 A network of beam splitters and phase shifters implements the two partial Bell measurements (\ud835\udcd1\u2081,\ud835\udcd1\u2082) and then recombines/splits modes to route each possible Bell input to a unique four-click detector pattern.  \n\u2022 Four photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors monitor the outputs. Specific click patterns unambiguously identify each Bell state.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth.

Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors.

Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walks for Vertex Ranking in Graphs\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Time-delayed single satellite quantum repeater node for global quantum\n  communications\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Multipartite entanglement measures: a review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

An amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate: two single\u2010photon\u2010emitter qubits at Alice and Bob are teleported into each other by a central linear\u2010optics circuit that uses extra PDC sources as heralded gain stages to boost Bell\u2010measurement success.  \n  2. A gain\u2010enhanced entanglement\u2010repeater segment: two weak Bell\u2010pairs (PDC sources) are joined and distilled into a stronger Bell\u2010pair via an intermediate chain of PDC gain elements, all heralded by detectors, thereby realizing entanglement swapping plus amplification in one node.  \n  3. A cascaded emitter\u2010photon\u2013entanglement chain: each single\u2010photon emitter is entangled with a photon; these photons go sequentially through PDC \u201cgain blocks\u201d whose outputs are jointly detected to distribute a GHZ\u2010style correlation among all the emitters, mimicking a threshold\u2010like build-up of coherence across the network.  \nStep 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010feasibility check:  \n  1. Amplified SWAP gate is novel\u2014no existing Pytheus experiment uses PDC gain as part of a teleportation\u2010gate and interfaces single_emitters. It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, single_emitters, beam splitters and detectors\u2014within Pytheus scope.  \n  2. The repeater\u2010segment distillation is interesting but closely resembles entanglement\u2010swapping + resource saving ideas already explored (two\u2010pair swapping with ancilla).  \n  3. The cascaded GHZ\u2010chain with gain blocks is exotic but risks reducing to a state\u2010generation target rather than a network transformation.  \nStep 3: Choose idea 1: the amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because it embeds small\u2010scale lasing behavior\u2014multiple PDC sources acting as heralded gain amplifiers\u2014directly into a teleportation\u2010gate circuit and couples abstract single\u2010photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter nodes) via a purely linear\u2010optics network. No prior Pytheus setup has used gain blocks to boost teleportation gates or interfaced single_emitters in that way.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it exclusively employs probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (for Bell pairs and gain elements), single\u2010photon emitters (for the two input qubits), a static linear\u2010optical network of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralding detectors\u2014no cavity/QED modeling or feedback control is required.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a proposal for Pytheus to design an \u201camplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate\u201d between two single\u2010photon emitters, combining lasing\u2010style gain (via extra PDC sources) and strong light\u2013matter coupling (abstract single_emitters) in a heralded teleportation network.\n\nExplanation:  \nWe want to realize a post\u2010selected SWAP gate on two emitter\u2010qubits E_A and E_B by teleporting E_A\u2192E_B and E_B\u2192E_A simultaneously, but boosted by \u201cgain\u201d PDC sources that amplify the Bell\u2010measurement success probability (mimicking lasing behavior).  \n\n1) Single\u2010photon emitters [0] and [1] prepare the two arbitrary input qubits (strong light\u2013matter coupling nodes).  \n2) Two PDC sources (S1, S2) generate the Bell pairs needed for teleportation.  \n3) Two additional PDC sources (G1, G2) act as heralded gain blocks: each is placed in one arm of the Bell\u2010measurement interferometer to probabilistically amplify the two\u2010photon interference terms, thereby increasing the teleportation success amplitude.  \n4) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the Bell\u2010measurement on the four photonic modes (two from emitters + two from S1,S2), interleaved with gain blocks G1,G2.  \n5) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancillary modes; successful SWAP is post\u2010selected on a specific four\u2010click pattern.  \n6) Outputs at two designated detectors carry the teleported states to E_B and E_A respectively (abstractly the outputs \u201cland\u201d back on the matter nodes).\n\nVisualization (top to bottom):  \nemitters:  [Emitter 0] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2510                     \u250c\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_B]  \n                        \u251c\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2081)\u2500[G1]\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2510  detectors         \nemitters:  [Emitter 1] \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2518               \u2502  \u2514\u2500[G2]\u2500(Bell\u2013\ud835\udcd1\u2082)\u2014\u2510  \n                                         \u2502                 \u2514\u2014\u2014 [Detected \u2192 E_A]  \nBell-sources S1,S2 feed the middle of each Bell circuit; G1,G2 (gain PDCs) are inserted in the two ancilla arms.  \n\nSuggested Pytheus config skeleton:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Amplified teleportation\u2013based SWAP gate between two single-photon emitters\",  \n  \"foldername\": \"GainTeleportSwap\",  \n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.0,  \n  \"edges_tried\": 30,  \n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,  \n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",  \n  \"num_anc\": 4,                # four heralding detectors  \n  \"num_pre\": 1,  \n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",  \n  \"imaginary\": false,  \n  \"safe_hist\": true,  \n  \"samples\": 10,  \n  \"target_quantum\": [\"0000\",\"0110\",\"1001\",\"1111\"],  # SWAP truth table: |00>\u2192|00|,|01>\u2192|10|,|10>\u2192|01|,|11>\u2192|11|  \n  \"single_emitters\": [0,1],    # input qubits on emitters  \n  \"removed_connections\": [],  \n  \"unicolor\": false,  \n  \"number_resolving\": true  \n}  \n\nKey points:  \n- single_emitters index 0 and 1 are the two matter qubits\u2019 inputs.  \n- four ancilla detectors herald the desired SWAP outcome.  \n- PDC sources used both for Bell resources (S1,S2) and gain blocks (G1,G2).  \n- Linear optics only\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n\nThis network can be generalized to teleportation\u2010based two\u2010qubit gates with adjustable gain stages, or cascaded to build larger repeaters and multi\u2010node SWAP networks, illustrating a whole family of experiments at the interplay of lasing\u2010like gain and strong light\u2013matter coupling.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme reduces to two concurrent teleportations (SWAP) on matter qubits\u2014already realized virtually identically (see the ensemble\u2019s atomic\u2010qubit SWAP teleportation)\u2014and the addition of heralded PDC \u201cgain\u201d stages merely improves success rate rather than enacting a new transformation or exhibiting new physics.

It only uses probabilistic photon-pair sources, single_emitters, linear optics, and post-selected detectors. There are no cavities or feedback control.  \nStep 3: Feasibility is guaranteed: single_emitter nodes at indices [0,1,2]; three Bell\u2010pair sources to connect each adjacent link; two extra PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 as heralded gain/switch blocks; beam splitters to perform the two entanglement\u2010swap measurements in parallel; and heralding detectors to choose which swap succeeded. Different heralding patterns route the entanglement A\u2013B or B\u2013C (and by symmetry one can build A\u2013C).  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a new target for Pytheus\u2014a \u201cgain-switched entanglement router\u201d among three single-photon emitter qubits, combining lasing-style gain blocks and strong light\u2013matter coupling in a programmable swapping network:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe have three emitter qubits E\u2080, E\u2081, E\u2082 (nodes 0,1,2) carrying arbitrary input states. We wish to entangle either (E\u2080,E\u2081) or (E\u2081,E\u2082) on demand, by performing two parallel entanglement\u2010swapping circuits and letting heralded gain\u2010blocks decide which link succeeds.  \n\n1) PDC sources S\u2080\u2081 and S\u2081\u2082 each generate a Bell pair of photons for the two adjacent links (\u3008E\u2080\u2013E\u2081\u3009 and \u3008E\u2081\u2013E\u2082\u3009).  \n2) Two additional PDC sources G\u2080\u2081 and G\u2081\u2082 act as heralded \u201cgain\u201d or \u201cswitch\u201d blocks: each one is inserted into one arm of the corresponding Bell\u2010measurement interferometer, boosting the two\u2010photon interference amplitude (lasing analogue).  \n3) Beam splitters and phase shifters implement the two swap circuits simultaneously: one circuit mixes the photon from S\u2080\u2081 with E\u2080\u2019s photon at a Bell\u2010measurement stage \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 (with G\u2080\u2081), the other mixes the photon from S\u2081\u2082 with E\u2082\u2019s photon at \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082 (with G\u2081\u2082).  \n4) Four heralding detectors monitor the ancilla outputs of \ud835\udcd1\u2080\u2081 and \ud835\udcd1\u2081\u2082.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2080\u2081 detectors (and null clicks on G\u2081\u2082) heralds a successful E\u2080\u2013E\u2081 Bell\u2010pair.  \n   \u2013 A click\u2010pattern on the G\u2081\u2082 detectors (and null on G\u2080\u2081) heralds E\u2081\u2013E\u2082 entanglement.  \n   \u2013 Other patterns are discarded.  \n5) The output matter qubits at E\u2080&E\u2081 (or E\u2081&E\u2082) are thus post-selected into a Bell state, demonstrating programmable routing of entanglement via gain\u2010enhanced swapping.\n\nGeneralization: By adding a third gain-block G\u2080\u2082 and corresponding swap circuit, one can route entanglement between any pair of three or more nodes, exploring the interplay of heralded \u201clasing\u201d gain and network\u2010level entanglement switching.
