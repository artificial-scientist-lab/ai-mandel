Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to tie “complex quantum algorithm” and “logical gate” into a Pytheus‐compatible target (no state generation, only network/measurement):
    1. A heralded, teleportation‐based nonlocal qutrit controlled‐phase gate (CPhase₃) between two remote parties—this gate is a primitive in algorithms like qutrit-Grover and multi-valued phase estimation.
    2. A post-selected Bell-pair network that implements a single iteration of Grover’s oracle on two remote qutrits via measurement-induced CZ gates—combining entanglement swapping with a two-qutrit phase inversion.
    3. A four-node distributed QFT₂ (i.e. two-qubit quantum Fourier transform) across two parties, realized entirely by teleportation of Hadamards and controlled-phase gates, without dynamic feed-forward.
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
    1. Remote CPhase₃: No prior Pytheus design for an actual qutrit gate; uses only linear optics, entangled pair sources, ancillas—Pytheus can handle complex amplitudes (imaginary=True) and abstract d=3. 
    2. Grover oracle for qutrits: More algorithmic, but specifying the oracle mapping (phases) may stretch Pytheus’s mapping‐as‐state functionality and introduces more ancilla complexity.
    3. Distributed QFT₂: Conceptually neat but 2-qubit QFT is just H + CPhase; weaker novelty and essentially a simpler case of (1) for d=2.
  Step 3: Pick most promising: the teleportation‐based nonlocal qutrit controlled‐phase gate. 
  Step 4: This idea is novel because no Pytheus experiment has designed a genuine higher-dimensional logical gate (all prior gates were qubit CNOT/Toffoli)—this would be the first heralded qutrit CPhase. 
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only uses probabilistic photon‐pair sources, ancillary photons, linear optics, and post‐selected measurements (no real‐time feed-forward), and Pytheus can encode abstract d=3 systems and complex amplitudes. 

Action: final answer
Action Input: 
Here is a concrete target for Pytheus.  We want to implement a heralded, teleportation-based, nonlocal controlled-phase gate for two qutrits (dimension d=3).  This is a key logical primitive for multi-valued quantum algorithms (e.g. qutrit phase estimation, Shor-style arithmetic, and Grover on 3-level systems).  Instead of generating a special state, the network applies the map

 |i⟩ₐ |j⟩ᵦ  → ω^{i·j} |i⟩ₐ |j⟩ᵦ,

with ω = exp(2πi/3), on two remote nodes A and B that never directly interact.

General structure:
• Parties A and B each hold one input qutrit (three modes per qudit).  
• We employ two entangled‐pair sources (Bell-like for qutrits) linking A↔Charlie and B↔Charlie.  
• Charlie performs a joint measurement on his two ancilla qutrits to effect a teleportation-based CZ gate between A and B.  Successful heralding patterns post-select the CPhase₃.  
• No single source connects A and B directly—enforce this via removed_connections.  
• The network uses num_anc = 4 ancillary photons (two qutrit Bell pairs) and Charlie’s detectors herald the gate success.  
• imaginary = True to allow the ω-phases in the target mapping.  
• number_resolving = True for full post-selection fidelity.

By searching this target, Pytheus will produce a linear-optical layout that teleports a qutrit CPhase gate across two parties with heralded success.  This experiment can be directly generalized to higher d or chained into multi-gate networks for small‐scale quantum algorithms.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond mere state preparation by targeting a heralded, teleportation‐based nonlocal two-qutrit controlled-phase gate—a primitive not covered by any prior qubit or qutrit schemes in the ensemble. All existing teleportation-based gate proposals focus on qubits (CNOT, SWAP, Fredkin, etc.) or sensing of phase products, but none implements the ω^{i·j} map for d=3. Implementing a true two-qutrit CPhase using only linear optics, qutrit Bell sources, and post-selection is both challenging and genuinely new.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: I agree that this target is sufficiently novel and of PRL caliber: it realizes a nontrivial multi-valued quantum gate across remote parties using only static linear optics and heralding, opening the door to higher-dimensional teleportation-based logic.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  
Heralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase₃) for Two Qutrits

Mini-Abstract:  
We present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled‐phase gate CPhase₃ across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie’s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map ω^{ij} (with ω = e^{2πi/3}) on the basis states |i⟩ₐ|j⟩ᵦ without any direct A–B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal describes a nonlocal, heralded implementation of a qutrit controlled‐phase gate via teleportation, which is a genuine transformation rather than mere state generation, and it fits squarely within PyTheus’s capability to design heralded multi‐photon linear‐optical gates in higher dimensions. Using two d=3 Bell‐like pairs, four ancillas, and a joint ancilla measurement is experimentally plausible with modern photonic sources and detectors, and it extends known qubit‐level teleportation‐gate schemes to qutrits in a novel way.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This teleportation‐based nonlocal CPhase₃ gate is a sound and novel higher‐dimensional logical primitive that leverages realistic entangled qutrit pairs and heralded ancilla measurements, making it a compelling target for PyTheus design.
