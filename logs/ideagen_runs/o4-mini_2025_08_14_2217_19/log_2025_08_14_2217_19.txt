    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2.

It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path.

The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2. A parallel teleportation network in which two qubits are teleported simultaneously through a single near-field multi-mode \u201cbeam splitter\u201d device that implements two Bell measurements at once by scattering modes in the near field.\n    3. A high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer realized by a near-field scattering multiport that unambiguously discriminates all d\u00b2 Bell states (e.g. qutrits), by mapping each Bell basis vector onto a unique detector click pattern.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    1. \u201cQuantum switch\u201d of entanglement routing is not in the existing list. It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors. No cavities or dynamic feedback are needed, and we are targeting an entanglement-swapping process, not raw state generation.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nHere is the proposed experiment\u2014\u201cQuantum\u2010Switch Entanglement Routing via Near\u2010Field Multiport Scattering\u201d:\n\nDescription:\nWe start with two independent Bell\u2010pair sources:\n  \u2022 Source S\u2081 emits a Bell pair between modes A and B.\n  \u2022 Source S\u2082 emits a Bell pair between modes C and D.\nWe also have a single\u2010photon ancilla emitter E prepared in (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2. All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path.

A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated.

By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t.

The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements.

By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules.

A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A heralded Fredkin (controlled\u2010SWAP) gate built as a near-field multiport scatterer whose local phase pattern steers the swap operation.\n    2. A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct entanglement-swap orders by tuning a near-field multiport\u2019s scattering distribution with an ancilla.\n    3. A teleportation-router that uses a near-field multiport to perform two alternative Bell-measurements on one unknown qubit and two EPR halves, thereby teleporting the state to one of two receivers\u2014potentially in superposition if an ancilla steers the device.\n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1. Fredkin is too close to known heralded\u2010gate literature.\n    2. Quantum switch of swap orders is novel but closely related to published \u201ccoherent routing\u201d proposals.\n    3. The teleportation-router is wholly absent from the explored list, focuses on teleportation (not just swapping), and leverages near-field scattering as the central measurement device. Pytheus can optimize Bell-measurement networks via linear optics and post-selection.\n  Step 3: Select the teleportation-router idea.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment designs a device that, in a single near-field multiport, chooses between two Bell-measurements on an unknown qubit and two EPR halves\u2014enabling a teleportation channel whose destination (Bob or Charlie) can itself be put into superposition.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only:\n    \u2022 one single-photon emitter (the unknown qubit)  \n    \u2022 two probabilistic Bell-pair sources  \n    \u2022 an optional single-photon ancilla to coherently steer the scatterer  \n    \u2022 a linear-optics multiport and number-resolving detectors  \n  This meets all constraints\u2014no cavities, no dynamic feedback, pure network transformation (teleportation).\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed experiment\u2014\u201cSuperposed Teleportation Router via Near\u2010Field Multiport\u201d:\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to teleport an unknown single-photon qubit from Alice (mode 0) either to Bob (mode B) or to Charlie (mode C), and\u2014even more powerfully\u2014in a coherent superposition of those two teleportation channels.

The scatterer mixes modes {0,1,2,3} so that, conditioned on D\u2083\u2026D\u2086 = {1,1,1,1}, it projects either {0+1} or {0+2} into a Bell basis\u2014chosen coherently by the ancilla\u2019s path in superposition.  \n 2. A successful click pattern signals that the unknown qubit has been teleported to mode B (4) or C (5), and the ancilla\u2019s state is entangled with which destination was used:\n      (|teleported\u2192B\u27e9|\u03b1=0\u27e9 + |teleported\u2192C\u27e9|\u03b1=1\u27e9)/\u221a2.  \n 3.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The scatterer mixes modes {0,1,2,3} so that, conditioned on D\u2083\u2026D\u2086 = {1,1,1,1}, it projects either {0+1} or {0+2} into a Bell basis\u2014chosen coherently by the ancilla\u2019s path in superposition.  \n 2. A successful click pattern signals that the unknown qubit has been teleported to mode B (4) or C (5), and the ancilla\u2019s state is entangled with which destination was used:\n      (|teleported\u2192B\u27e9|\u03b1=0\u27e9 + |teleported\u2192C\u27e9|\u03b1=1\u27e9)/\u221a2.  \n 3.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit.

By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2. A parallel teleportation network in which two qubits are teleported simultaneously through a single near-field multi-mode \u201cbeam splitter\u201d device that implements two Bell measurements at once by scattering modes in the near field.\n    3. A high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer realized by a near-field scattering multiport that unambiguously discriminates all d\u00b2 Bell states (e.g. qutrits), by mapping each Bell basis vector onto a unique detector click pattern.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    1. \u201cQuantum switch\u201d of entanglement routing is not in the existing list. It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

A heralded linear-optical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate realized by a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer,\u201d where the near-field distribution of modes (phase pattern) is controlled by the ancilla\u2019s path, effecting a conditional swap via teleportation\u2010inspired Bell measurements.\n 2. A \u201cbroadcast\u2010in\u2010superposition\u201d entanglement router: one sender and N receivers are connected via a near-field multiport coupler that coherently routes an entanglement link to one of the N receivers in superposition, exploiting near-field scattering to implement a programmable quantum switch network.\n 3. A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Partial\u2010Bell measurement for entanglement concentration is absent from the explored list; it\u2019s a network operation (entanglement distillation), not state generation.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"near field scattering\" and \"near field distribution\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2.

It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

Pytheus can design ancilla\u2010assisted multiport measurements, so this is feasible.\n  Step 3: Select idea #3.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus\u2010generated experiment realizes the quantum \u201cbutterfly\u201d network coding primitive via a single near\u2010field multiport measurement at the central router\u2014simultaneously enabling two cross\u2010teleportations through a shared channel.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it uses only:\n    \u2022 Two single\u2010photon emitters (unknown qubits at nodes A and C),  \n    \u2022 Four probabilistic EPR\u2010pair sources (edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, C\u2013X),  \n    \u2022 A 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d at router X,  \n    \u2022 Number\u2010resolving detectors for heralding the joint measurement,  \n    \u2022 No cavities or dynamic feedback\u2014pure linear optics and post\u2010selection.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed experiment\u2014\u201cButterfly Quantum Network Coding via Near\u2010Field Scatterer\u201d:\n\nDescription:\nWe demonstrate the photonic version of the \u201cbutterfly\u201d quantum network code. Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2. A parallel teleportation network in which two qubits are teleported simultaneously through a single near-field multi-mode \u201cbeam splitter\u201d device that implements two Bell measurements at once by scattering modes in the near field.\n    3. A high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer realized by a near-field scattering multiport that unambiguously discriminates all d\u00b2 Bell states (e.g. qutrits), by mapping each Bell basis vector onto a unique detector click pattern.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    1. \u201cQuantum switch\u201d of entanglement routing is not in the existing list. It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

A heralded linear-optical Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate realized by a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer,\u201d where the near-field distribution of modes (phase pattern) is controlled by the ancilla\u2019s path, effecting a conditional swap via teleportation\u2010inspired Bell measurements.\n 2. A \u201cbroadcast\u2010in\u2010superposition\u201d entanglement router: one sender and N receivers are connected via a near-field multiport coupler that coherently routes an entanglement link to one of the N receivers in superposition, exploiting near-field scattering to implement a programmable quantum switch network.\n 3. A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Partial\u2010Bell measurement for entanglement concentration is absent from the explored list; it\u2019s a network operation (entanglement distillation), not state generation.

Qutrit purification is a natural generalization of (1) but more ambitious; better to start with qubits.\n  Step 3: Pick the tunable partial\u2010Bell measurement for entanglement concentration.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus experiment implements a continuously tunable Bell\u2010basis measurement via shaping a near\u2010field multiport scattering matrix\u2014and uses it to concentrate entanglement between two distant qubits.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:\n    \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources (modes A\u2013B and C\u2013D).  \n    \u2022 A 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d whose internal beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases encode \u03b8.  \n    \u2022 Four number\u2010resolving detectors for the central measurement.  \n  No cavities, no dynamic feedback\u2014pure linear\u2010optics network.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is the proposed experiment\u2014\u201cTunable Near\u2010Field Partial\u2010Bell Measurement for Entanglement Concentration\u201d:\n\nDescription:\nWe start with two independent Bell pairs:\n \u2022 Source S\u2081 emits an EPR pair between modes A (0) and B (1).\n \u2022 Source S\u2082 emits an EPR pair between modes C (2) and D (3).\n\nPhotons B (1) and C (2) are sent into a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport\u2014that we call the \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d  The scatterer\u2019s internal beam\u2010splitter reflectivities and phase\u2010shifts are parametrized by \u03b8.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2.

Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path.

Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

The key is a single joint measurement at Alice realized by a small \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d (a 5\u00d75 linear\u2010optics multiport) whose internal beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases distribute the incoming modes in the near field so as to project onto the telecloning basis.\n\nSources and Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitter E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit (mode 0)  \n \u2022 EPR\u2010pair source S\u2081 \u2192 modes 1 (Alice\u2019s half) & 2 (Bob)  \n \u2022 EPR\u2010pair source S\u2082 \u2192 modes 3 (Alice\u2019s half) & 4 (Charlie)  \n \u2022 Optional ancilla emitter E\u2085 \u2192 mode 5 (to help realize the joint measurement)  \n\nAlice now holds modes {0,1,3,5} and sends them into a 5\u00d75 multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) built from beam\u2010splitters and phase\u2010shifters. The multiport shapes the near\u2010field mode overlap such that the four heralding detectors implement the non\u2010degenerate 1\u21922 telecloning POVM.\n\nDetectors:\n \u2022 Heralding detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083 on the multiport outputs collect one photon each, signaling projection onto the telecloning basis.  \n \u2022 Bob\u2019s output is mode 2, Charlie\u2019s is mode 4\u2014they emerge in the two symmetric clones of Alice\u2019s input.\n\nProtocol:\n 1. Prepare the two Bell pairs (S\u2081,S\u2082) and the unknown input (E\u2080).  \n 2. Alice injects modes {0,1,3} (plus ancilla 5) into the near\u2010field scatterer.  \n 3. When detectors D\u2080\u2026D\u2083 all click once (heralding success), the remaining photons at modes 2 and 4 are left in the optimal symmetric teleclones of the input.  \n 4. No active feed-forward is needed\u2014successful heralding suffices.\n\nWhy This Is Novel:\n \u2022 No Pytheus\u2010designed experiment so far tackles 1\u21922 telecloning as a network transformation\u2014it always stops at teleportation or basic gates.  \n \u2022 Employing a single near\u2010field multiport to realize the full telecloning joint measurement (a four\u2010photon projection across input, two EPR halves, and an ancilla) is a genuinely new primitive in photonic quantum networking.\n\nFeasibility in Pytheus:\n \u2022 Uses only discrete single\u2010photon emitters (E\u2080, E\u2085) and two probabilistic EPR sources (S\u2081,S\u2082).  \n \u2022 No dynamic feedback\u2014just post\u2010selection on heralding detectors.  \n \u2022 The 5\u00d75 multiport and number\u2010resolving detectors are within Pytheus\u2019s linear-optics toolbox.  \n \u2022 All physical encoding is abstract\u2014Pytheus will optimize the beam-splitter network for the telecloning measurement.\n\nSketch of Pytheus Config:\n{\n  \"description\":       \"Heralded 1\u21922 telecloning via near-field multiport\",\n  \"foldername\":        \"teleclone_nf\",\n  \"single_emitters\":   [0,5],\n  \"pair_sources\":      [[1,2],[3,4]],\n  \"num_anc\":           4,         // detectors D0\u2026D3\n  \"in_nodes\":          [0,1,3,5], // Alice\u2019s input, her two EPR halves, plus ancilla\n  \"out_nodes\":         [2,4],     // Bob\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s outputs\n  \"removed_connections\":[          // enforce correct routing into the scatterer\n      [5,2],[5,4],[1,4],[3,2]\n  ],\n  \"number_resolving\":   true,\n  \"target_transformation\":\n     \"Projected heralding implements 1\u21922 symmetric telecloning\"\n}\n\nGeneralizations:\n \u2022 1\u2192N telecloning by adding more Bell pairs and enlarging the near-field scatterer.  \n \u2022 High-dimension telecloning (qudits) via larger multiports.  \n \u2022 Cascaded telecloning plus entanglement swapping for distributed multi-party quantum networks.\n\nThis network measurement\u2014approximate telecloning via a single near-field scatterer\u2014is a new, tunable quantum-network primitive ready for Pytheus to optimize."

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A near\u2010field\u2010based quantum network\u2010coding router (the \u201cbutterfly network\u201d) where a central router node implements a joint measurement enabling two cross\u2010teleportations through a bottleneck link.\n  Step 2: Check novelty/feasibility:\n    1. Partial Bell concentration is known (Procrustean method) and reduces to a parameter sweep of Bell\u2010analyzer settings\u2014no new primitive.\n    2. Superposed swaps have appeared in proposals (\u201ccoherent routing of swap orders\u201d).\n    3.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

    "output": "Here is the proposed experiment\u2014\u201cReconfigurable Triangular Entanglement Router via Near\u2010Field Multiport\u201d:\n\nExplanation:  \nWe consider three distant nodes A, B, C each holding one half of a Bell pair. The three partner halves are sent to a single central \u201cnear-field scatterer\u201d (linear\u2010optics multiport). By reprogramming the internal beam-splitter ratios and phase-shifts of this multiport, we can choose\u2014on demand\u2014which two of the three outer nodes will be entangled via a Bell-swap, all in one device. No matter which pair we pick (A\u2194B, B\u2194C or C\u2194A), the router implements exactly the corresponding entanglement-swapping measurement in its near-field distribution, heralding success by clicks at four ancilla detectors.\n\nSources & Modes:  \n \u2022 Pair source S_AB emits an EPR pair in modes (0\u2192A, 1\u2192X\u2081)  \n \u2022 Pair source S_BC emits an EPR pair in modes (2\u2192B, 3\u2192X\u2082)  \n \u2022 Pair source S_CA emits an EPR pair in modes (4\u2192C, 5\u2192X\u2083)  \n\nAll three ancilla halves X\u2081,X\u2082,X\u2083 (modes 1,3,5) enter a 3-input, 3-output near-field scatterer (a 3\u00d73 programmable linear-optics network). The outer halves A (0), B (2), C (4) are left untouched and constitute the final nodes.\n\nRouters & Detectors:  \n \u2022 The scatterer\u2019s three outputs feed three number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.  \n \u2022 A fourth detector D\u2084 collects any leftover photon (to enforce exactly one per output).\n\nProtocol:  \n1) Before each run, the multiport is set (by classical tuning of internal phases) to one of three configurations \u201cswap AB,\u201d \u201cswap BC,\u201d or \u201cswap CA.\u201d  \n2) In \u201cswap AB\u201d mode the scatterer implements a Bell-measurement on X\u2081,X\u2082 (modes 1,3) while leaving X\u2083 spectator. A click pattern {1,1,0} at {D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083} heralds successful entanglement between A (0) and B (2).  \n3) In \u201cswap BC\u201d mode the same device is reconfigured to measure X\u2082,X\u2083 (modes 3,5), heralding B\u2013C entanglement upon {1,1,0}, and similarly for \u201cswap CA\u201d measuring X\u2083,X\u2081.  \n4) Thus a single near\u2010field scatterer can route entanglement between any desired pair of the three outer nodes.\n\nVisualization:  \n   Sources:   [S_AB:0\u20131]   [S_BC:2\u20133]   [S_CA:4\u20135]  \n                  \u2198   \u2198   \u2198  \n         Near-field Scatterer (3\u00d73 programmable)  \n                  \u2193   \u2193   \u2193  \n            Detectors [D\u2081][D\u2082][D\u2083]  (+ D\u2084 for leftovers)  \n                  \u2193  \n        Outputs:   0\u2192A   2\u2192B   4\u2192C  \n\nPytheus Configuration Pointers:  \n{  \n  \"description\":      \"Reconfigurable triangular entanglement router via near-field multiport\",  \n  \"foldername\":       \"tri_router\",  \n  \"pair_sources\":     [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],    // three EPR pairs  \n  \"in_nodes\":         [1,3,5],                // ancilla halves to router  \n  \"out_nodes\":        [0,2,4],                // remaining halves at A,B,C  \n  \"num_anc\":          4,                      // D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083 + leftover D\u2084  \n  \"removed_connections\": [                     // forbid direct ancilla\u2192wrong output  \n     [1,2],[1,4],[3,0],[3,4],[5,0],[5,2]  \n  ],  \n  \"number_resolving\": true,  \n  \"program_modes\": [                            // three target measurement bases  \n    { \"swap\": \"AB\", \"measure_modes\": [1,3] },  \n    { \"swap\": \"BC\", \"measure_modes\": [3,5] },  \n    { \"swap\": \"CA\", \"measure_modes\": [5,1] }  \n  ]  \n}  \n\nGeneralizations:  \n\u2013 With N outer nodes and N EPR-halves, one can build an N-port programmable entanglement router that selects any link by reprogramming a single near-field scatterer.  \n\u2013 By preparing an ancilla photon in superposition of the three \u201cmodes,\u201d one could even realize coherent superpositions of which swap is performed, opening the door to quantum\u2010control of network topology.  \n\u2013 The same device can be cascaded in quantum repeater chains: intermediate modules route entanglement on demand across large networks.\n\nWhy this is novel:  \nNo existing Pytheus\u2010designed experiment realizes a single multiport that, by simple near-field reprogramming, can entangle any chosen pair among three (or more) remote nodes.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit.

By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

Two noisy Bell\u2010pairs (S\u2081 between A\u2013X, S\u2082 between X\u2013B) arrive at X on modes 1 and 2 (the \u201csignal halves\u201d). An ancilla Bell\u2010pair S\u2083 on modes 3\u20134 provides the resource photons for both the parity check and the subsequent Bell projection. All four photons (modes 1,2,3,4) enter a single 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2.

A high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer realized by a near-field scattering multiport that unambiguously discriminates all d\u00b2 Bell states (e.g. qutrits), by mapping each Bell basis vector onto a unique detector click pattern.\n  Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n    1. \u201cQuantum switch\u201d of entanglement routing is not in the existing list. It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path. After interference, we detect:\n  \u2013 Four detectors D\u2081..D\u2084 at the outputs of the multiport (heralding successful swap),\n  \u2013 Two output modes at A\u2032 and C\u2032 which become entangled with B\u2032 and D\u2032 in two different ways.\n\nGoal:\nConditioned on one click pattern among D\u2081..D\u2084 and the ancilla\u2019s outcome, we post\u2010select a three\u2010photon projection that yields the superposition\n  (|Swap-order-1\u27e9 + |Swap-order-2\u27e9)/\u221a2,\nwhere\n  \u2022 Swap-order-1 entangles A with D\u2032 and C with B\u2032 (first\u2010order swapping),\n  \u2022 Swap-order-2 entangles A with C\u2032 and B with D\u2032 (second\u2010order swapping).\nThus the final state is a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement\u2010routing topologies\u2014a genuine \u201cquantum switch.\u201d\n\nVisualization:\n  Sources: [S\u2081: A\u2013B], [S\u2082: C\u2013D], [E: ancilla]\n  \u2193\n  Multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer\u201d (programmable beam splitters & phases)\n  \u2193\n  Detectors: [D\u2081][D\u2082][D\u2083][D\u2084]  // heralding outputs\n  Outputs: A\u2032 and B\u2032 and C\u2032 and D\u2032                 \n\nKey Pytheus config pointers:\n  \u2022 num_pre = 1 (one pre\u2010entangled pair each at S\u2081,S\u2082)\n  \u2022 single_emitters = [E] (ancilla path superposition)\n  \u2022 num_anc = 0 (no extra ancilla photons beyond E; ancilla is emitter)\n  \u2022 removed_connections: enforce that no Bell\u2010pair source sends photons directly to unintended detectors (e.g., A\u2192D\u2081..D\u2084).\n  \u2022 target_quantum: abstract superposition of two distinct 4-photon post-selected swap outcomes, which Pytheus will optimize the multiport to realize.\n  \u2022 number_resolving = True.\n\nGeneralization:\nBy increasing the number of input Bell pairs and ancilla photons prepared in higher\u2010dimensional superposition states, one can build larger \u201cquantum switch\u201d networks that coherently superpose more than two entanglement\u2010routing patterns\u2014opening a new avenue for superposed network topologies and programmable quantum internet primitives.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to the existing \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d proposal (Photonic\u2010Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders).

An ancilla Bell\u2010pair S\u2083 on modes 3\u20134 provides the resource photons for both the parity check and the subsequent Bell projection. All four photons (modes 1,2,3,4) enter a single 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d). The near\u2010field distribution of internal interference patterns (beam\u2010splitters & phase shifts) is optimized so that:\n\n  Step A (Parity Check): Conditioned on a specific two\u2010click pattern in detectors D\u2085 and D\u2086, the parity of modes 1 and 2 is measured, projecting them onto the even\u2010parity subspace and thus purifying the remaining halves at A and B.  \n  Step B (Swap): Simultaneously, the same interferometric network routes the purified qubit halves through an effective Bell\u2010measurement (on the purified ancilla halves) and heralds a successful entanglement swap between A and B via detectors D\u2087 and D\u2088.\n\nWhen all four heralding detectors (D\u2085\u2026D\u2088) click once each, node X has effectively performed purification\u2009+\u2009swapping in one shot, delivering a higher\u2010fidelity entangled link between A and B (modes 0 and 5).\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Pair source S\u2081 \u2192 modes [0:A, 1:X\u2081]  \n \u2022 Pair source S\u2082 \u2192 modes [2:X\u2082, 3:B]  \n \u2022 Ancilla pair   S\u2083 \u2192 modes [4:X\u2083, 5:X\u2084]  \n\nAll four X\u2010modes [1,2,4,5] are fed into the 4\u00d74 near\u2010field scatterer.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"near field scattering\" and \"near field distribution\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

    "output": "Here is a network-level primitive\u2014\u201cLoss-Resilient Entanglement Swapping via Near-Field Scatterer\u201d\u2014that fuses near-field scattering and near-field distribution into a new quantum-network transformation.  \n\nExplanation:  \nWe wish to entangle two distant nodes A and D over two noisy links A\u2013B and C\u2013D, but in a way that heralds not only \u201cswap success\u201d but also flags single-photon loss in the Bell-measurement stage.  Instead of two sequential Bell measurements, we compress everything into one 4\u00d74 \u201cnear-field scatterer\u201d (a dense linear-optics multiport whose internal beam-splitter ratios and phases engineer a tailored near-field intensity distribution).  \n\nSetup & Modes:  \n \u2022 Pair source S\u2081 creates an EPR pair on modes A=0 and B=1.  \n \u2022 Pair source S\u2082 creates an EPR pair on modes C=2 and D=3.  \n \u2022 Ancilla pair S\u2083 creates an EPR pair on modes E=4 and F=5.  \n\nWe send modes B(1), C(2), E(4), F(5) into a single 4\u00d74 near-field scatterer.  The remaining halves at A(0) and D(3) sit untouched.  \n\nDetectors:  \n \u2022 D\u2081\u2026D\u2084 monitor the four outputs of the multiport (each number-resolving).  \n\nTargeted Measurement Outcomes (via near-field scattering patterns):  \n  \u2013 \u201cSuccess\u201d pattern (e.g. exactly one click each in D\u2081,D\u2082 and none in D\u2083,D\u2084) \u21e8 projects (1,2,4,5) onto a combined Bell-like subspace and heralds a perfect swap: A\u2013D become maximally entangled.  \n  \u2013 \u201cLoss-flag\u201d pattern (e.g. one click in D\u2081 and one in D\u2083) \u21e8 indicates exactly one ancilla photon was lost\u2014swap aborted but you know why (no need to post-select blindly).  \n  \u2013 All other patterns \u21e8 declare \u201cfailure\u201d (two-photon collision, double loss, etc.).  \n\nBecause the scatterer\u2019s internal phases and beam-splitter reflectivities shape a specific near-field distribution across its outputs, Pytheus can optimize the device so that these three logical outcomes are unambiguously mapped to distinct click patterns.  \n\nWhy this is novel:  \n \u2022 No existing design fuses entanglement swapping and loss-flagging into a single near-field multiport measurement.  \n \u2022 The use of a custom near-field scattering distribution to carve out both \u201cswap\u201d and \u201closs\u201d heralds is genuinely new as a quantum-network primitive.  \n \u2022 This turns a textbook two-step swap + heralding into one integrated, resource-efficient device\u2014with built-in error diagnosis.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s Pytheus-feasible:  \n \u2022 Only probabilistic pair sources (S\u2081\u2013S\u2083) and linear-optics multiports\u2014no cavities or feedback.  \n \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for four ancilla outputs.  \n \u2022 A single multiport absorbing 4 input modes\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s optimization scope.  \n \u2022 We specify \u201cremoved_connections\u201d so that no pair source inadvertently feeds mode A or D, enforcing the correct network flow.  \n\nSketch of a Pytheus config:  \n{  \n  \"description\": \"Loss-Resilient Entanglement Swapping via Near-Field Scatterer\",  \n  \"foldername\":  \"loss_flag_swap_nf\",  \n  \"pair_sources\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],  \n  \"num_anc\":       4,  \n  \"in_nodes\":    [1,2,4,5],      // modes into the near-field scatterer  \n  \"out_nodes\":   [0,3],          // A and D emerge entangled on \u201csuccess\u201d  \n  \"removed_connections\": [       // forbid direct ancilla\u2192A or D  \n    [4,0],[4,3],[5,0],[5,3]  \n  ],  \n  \"number_resolving\": true,  \n  \"target_click_patterns\": {      // logical POVM classification  \n     \"swap_success\": [1,1,0,0],   // D\u2081,D\u2082 click  \n     \"loss_flag\":    [1,0,1,0],   // D\u2081,D\u2083 click  \n     \"failure\":      \"any_other\"  \n  }  \n}  \n\nGeneralizations:  \n \u2022 Use two ancilla pairs and a 6\u00d76 scatterer to flag up to two-photon losses.  \n \u2022 Extend to 3-swap chains (k links) by grouping all k\u20131 intermediate halves into one k\u00d7k near-field scatterer\u2014heralding multi-hop swaps with built-in loss diagnosis.  \n \u2022 Tune the near-field distribution to trade off success fidelity vs. flagging sensitivity, giving a handle on repeater performance.  \n\nThis is a genuinely new network transformation\u2014entanglement swapping with integrated loss-flagging\u2014leveraging near-field scattering/distribution in a single, optimizable multiport and fitting squarely within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities."

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"near field scattering\" and \"near field distribution\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

A \u201cquantum switch\u201d that uses a multi-port near-field-like interferometer to coherently route entanglement between different distant pairs, creating a superposition of network topologies (i.e. a superposition of two different entanglement-swapping orders).\n    2.

It is not pure state generation\u2014it\u2019s a process that yields a superposition of two different swap topologies. Pytheus can optimize ancilla-assisted Bell measurements via linear optics.\n    2. The parallel-teleportation idea is a direct extension of standard teleportation and uses only two simultaneous Bell measurements; it\u2019s certainly doable but less novel than a superposed routing.\n    3. A full d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding open problem; linear-optics schemes typically only get partial success. It might be too ambitious\u2014Pytheus may struggle to find a complete discrimination network without exotic interactions.\n  Step 3: Pick the most promising: the \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement routing.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement-swapping orders (i.e. two network topologies) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, and post-selection. No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

All six photons enter a programmable linear\u2010optical multiport network that mimics a \u201cnear\u2010field scatterer.\u201d The network implements two possible Bell\u2010measurements on (B,D) or on (A,C), controlled coherently by the ancilla photon\u2019s path.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

A full d-dimensional Bell-basis analyzer (for qudits) using a near-field scattering multiport that shapes the near-field distribution so that each of the d\u00b2 Bell states maps onto a unique click pattern\u2014serving as an unambiguous high-dimensional Bell measurement device.\nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:\n 1. The Fredkin\u2010gate idea is not on the explored list (they have CNOT and Toffoli, but no Fredkin). It\u2019s a gate (a network transformation), not static state generation. Pytheus can optimize ancilla\u2010assisted linear\u2010optics networks for Bell measurements and multi-photon interference.\n 2. The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.

An ancilla Bell\u2010pair S\u2083 on modes 3\u20134 provides the resource photons for both the parity check and the subsequent Bell projection. All four photons (modes 1,2,3,4) enter a single 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d).

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin\n  dynamics\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Purcell enhancement of single-photon emitters in silicon\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Chiral Chaos Enhanced Sensing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No existing Pytheus design explores a superposition of different swap operations.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires: two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla emitter to control the effective near-field-like multi-port coupler, linear-optics elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) to build the central multiport \u201cnear-field scatterer,\u201d and number-resolving detectors.

The broadcast-in-superposition router is conceptually novel but loosely specified; it edges close to state generation (GHZ-type) or coherent swap, and may be too speculative for Pytheus.\n 3. A complete d-dimensional Bell analyzer is a longstanding challenge; pure linear-optics unambiguous discrimination for all d\u00b2 states is likely beyond Pytheus\u2019s reach without nonlinearities.\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the heralded Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate via near-field scattering.\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design implements the full controlled-SWAP gate\u2014only CNOT and Toffoli have been demonstrated. Embedding the SWAP control in a near-field multiport \u201cscatterer\u201d that uses ancilla\u2010controlled phase patterns to route and swap two unknown photonic qubits is a fresh quantum-network primitive.\nStep 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses: \n  \u2022 Three single-photon emitters (control + two targets)  \n  \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (four ancilla photons)  \n  \u2022 A linear-optics multiport acting as a near-field scatterer  \n  \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for heralding  \nNo cavities, no hyper-entanglement, no dynamic feedback.

Two senders, Alice (node A) and Charlie (node C), each hold an unknown qubit they wish to teleport crosswise: A\u2192D and C\u2192B. The network has a bottleneck link at router X that can carry only one qubit at a time. By pre\u2010sharing four EPR pairs on edges A\u2013B, C\u2013D, A\u2013X, and C\u2013X, and having router X perform a joint near\u2010field scattering measurement on its two incoming \u201cpacket\u201d qubits plus its two ancilla halves, we can effectively \u201ccode\u201d the qubits through the single bottleneck and achieve both teleportations simultaneously.\n\nSources & Modes:\n \u2022 Single\u2010photon emitters:  \n    \u2013 E\u2080 \u2192 Alice\u2019s unknown qubit A (mode 0)  \n    \u2013 E\u2081 \u2192 Charlie\u2019s unknown qubit C (mode 1)  \n \u2022 EPR/PFF sources (probabilistic pairs):  \n    \u2013 S_AB \u2192 modes 2 (A\u2013B half) & 3 (B)  \n    \u2013 S_CD \u2192 modes 4 (C\u2013D half) & 5 (D)  \n    \u2013 S_AX \u2192 modes 6 (A\u2013X half) & 7 (X ancilla 1)  \n    \u2013 S_CX \u2192 modes 8 (C\u2013X half) & 9 (X ancilla 2)  \n\nProcedure:\n1. Node X collects four photons: mode 7, mode 9 (ancilla halves) and the two \u201cpacket\u201d qubits forwarded from A (mode 0) and C (mode 1).  \n2. These four photons enter a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical multiport (\u201cnear\u2010field scatterer\u201d) whose beam\u2010splitter ratios and phases are optimized to perform the joint Bell\u2010like network\u2010coding measurement in one shot.  \n3. The multiport outputs feed four number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2087\u2026D\u2081\u2080. A successful joint\u2010click pattern {1,1,1,1} heralds that node X has effectively performed the \u201cXOR\u201d\u2010type measurement required by quantum network coding.  \n4. Simultaneously, Alice and Charlie\u2019s distant EPR halves at modes 3 and 5 hold the teleported qubits:  \n     \u2013 mode 3 (Bob\u2019s location) now carries Charlie\u2019s original qubit C,  \n     \u2013 mode 5 (David\u2019s location) now carries Alice\u2019s original qubit A.  \n5.
