    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement.

Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B.

The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement.

Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B.

Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness via Passive Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We implement a PT-symmetric supermap that approximates the partial transpose on one photonic qubit (mode B) by employing a passive, PT-symmetric beam splitter with engineered static loss and post-selection on no-click events, followed by a Bell-basis projection between the transposed qubit and the remaining qubit (mode A). This network realizes, as its target, a PT-Symmetric Partial-Transpose Entanglement Witness for an unknown two-qubit state \u03c1_AB\u2014directly enacting the Peres\u2013Horodecki PPT test with a tunable trade-off between entanglement-detection fidelity and success probability via loss-parameter tuning at the exceptional point.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C.

By targeting the observed joint detection correlations across spatial nodes A\u2013B\u2013C and time bins m=0,1 and evaluating the bilocality parameter B against the classical bound B\u22641, we observe violations (B>1) that reveal genuine non-bilocal quantum causal structure.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation is not in the existing list (we only have single\u2010link swapping), uses a single static interferometer + ancilla detectors, no feedback, purely linear optics \u2192 fully Pytheus\u2010compatible.  \n  2. Multi\u2010receiver switchboard is conceptually new but requires an N+1-photon joint measurement for N receivers; for N=2 or 3 it\u2019s feasible, but complexity grows quickly.  \n  3. Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity.

Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

A single heralding pattern indicates that |\u03c8\u27e9 has been teleported from 0\u21924 (with known Pauli frame) in one shot.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting & Generalizable:\n \u2022 Eliminates intermediate classical communication and switching\u2014both heralding and output correction can be handled offline.  \n \u2022 Showcases metasurfaces for high-order multi-photon operations and photonic crystals for integrated timing/routing.  \n \u2022 Directly extensible to \u201cone-shot N-hop\u201d teleporters (use a 2N-photon joint measurement on a metasurface) or chain-topologies.\n\nPytheus Configuration Skeleton:\n```python\n{\n  'description': 'One-Shot Two-Hop Teleportation via Metasurface Multiport',\n  'foldername': 'one_shot_two_hop_teleport',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-6,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                 # detectors on the metasurface outputs\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples': 10,\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'number_resolving': True,\n  'single_emitters': [0],       # photon 0 is the unknown qubit\n  'removed_connections': [],    # standard Bell-pair routing is allowed\n  'in_nodes': [],               # sources feed directly into the metasurface\n  'anc_detectors': [0,1,2,3],   # metasurface output modes\n  'out_nodes': [4]              # photon 4 is the teleported output\n}\n```\nThis target is a pure quantum-network primitive (two-hop teleportation) that Pytheus can optimize as a static linear-optics + ancilla-detection experiment, and it directly leverages both optical metasurfaces and dielectric photonic-crystal routing.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns.

To be novel at the PRL level, the scheme must add a new resource type, nontrivial causal or topological structure, or a genuinely unexplored measurement primitive rather than just swapping the photonic platform.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic-Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation:\nIn a standard two-hop teleportation (A\u2192B then B\u2192C), you perform two sequential Bell measurements and send classical outcomes forward. Here we fuse both Bell projections into a single static four-photon joint measurement implemented on an optical metasurface, and use a dielectric photonic-crystal network for on-chip delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive in phase.\n\nNodes & Photons:\n \u2022 Alice (A) holds photon 0 in an unknown qubit state |\u03c8\u27e9 (single-photon emitter) and photon 1 (half of Bell pair S\u2081).  \n \u2022 Repeater (B) holds photon 2 (the other half of S\u2081) and photon 3 (half of Bell pair S\u2082).  \n \u2022 Charlie (C) holds photon 4 (the other half of S\u2082).\n\nResources:\n \u2022 S\u2081 emits 1\u21942; S\u2082 emits 3\u21944 probabilistically.  \n \u2022 Photon 0 is the unknown input from a single-photon source.  \n \u2022 Photonic-crystal waveguides implement fixed delays and tight spectral filtering so that 0\u20133 arrive simultaneously onto the metasurface.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A 4-mode linear-optics network on an optical metasurface effects the two Bell projections (0\u22971 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one joint measurement.  \n \u2022 Its four output modes feed number-resolving detectors. A single heralding pattern indicates that |\u03c8\u27e9 has been teleported from 0\u21924 (with known Pauli frame) in one shot.\n\nWhy It\u2019s Interesting & Generalizable:\n \u2022 Eliminates intermediate classical communication and switching\u2014both heralding and output correction can be handled offline.  \n \u2022 Showcases metasurfaces for high-order multi-photon operations and photonic crystals for integrated timing/routing.  \n \u2022 Directly extensible to \u201cone-shot N-hop\u201d teleporters (use a 2N-photon joint measurement on a metasurface) or chain-topologies.\n\nPytheus Configuration Skeleton:\n```python\n{\n  'description': 'One-Shot Two-Hop Teleportation via Metasurface Multiport',\n  'foldername': 'one_shot_two_hop_teleport',\n  'bulk_thr': 0.01,\n  'edges_tried': 30,\n  'ftol': 1e-6,\n  'loss_func': 'cr',\n  'num_anc': 4,                 # detectors on the metasurface outputs\n  'num_pre': 1,\n  'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B',\n  'samples': 10,\n  'imaginary': False,\n  'safe_hist': True,\n  'number_resolving': True,\n  'single_emitters': [0],       # photon 0 is the unknown qubit\n  'removed_connections': [],    # standard Bell-pair routing is allowed\n  'in_nodes': [],               # sources feed directly into the metasurface\n  'anc_detectors': [0,1,2,3],   # metasurface output modes\n  'out_nodes': [4]              # photon 4 is the teleported output\n}\n```\nThis target is a pure quantum-network primitive (two-hop teleportation) that Pytheus can optimize as a static linear-optics + ancilla-detection experiment, and it directly leverages both optical metasurfaces and dielectric photonic-crystal routing.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The core quantum-network primitive\u2014compressing two sequential Bell swaps (or teleportation hops) into a single four-photon joint measurement\u2014has already been proposed in the ensemble\u2019s \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network.\u201d Merely swapping in a metasurface and photonic-crystal routing does not constitute a new network primitive or causal/topological feature.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This idea duplicates the one-shot two-hop entanglement-swap/teleportation primitive already in the ensemble list.

Photonic-Crystal Functions  \n \u2022 A dielectric photonic-crystal chip implements narrowband demultiplexing (\u03bb\u2081, \u03bb\u2082), fixed delays, and single-mode filtering so that photons 0, 1, 3 arrive synchronously at the metasurface.  \n\n3.

Two distinct click patterns herald teleportation of |\u03c8\u27e9 from 0\u21922 (Bob\u2081) or from 0\u21924 (Bob\u2082), with known Pauli frames tracked offline. All other patterns are discarded.  \n\n4. Why It\u2019s Interesting & Generalizable  \n \u2022 Introduces a quantum-network switch: one joint measurement both teleports and routes the qubit to one of several parties.  \n \u2022 Combines metasurfaces for high-order multi-photon operations and photonic crystals for integrated spectral routing.  \n \u2022 Easily extensible to N receivers by increasing the number of Bell pairs (one per receiver), spectral channels, and metasurface ports.  \n\n5.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "output": "Thought:\nWe need a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum\u2010network primitive that meaningfully combines \u201coptical metasurfaces\u201d and \u201cdielectric photonic crystals,\u201d yet goes beyond mere teleportation or swapping upgrades. A promising direction is to implement an all\u2010linear\u2010optics \u201cquantum switch\u201d that coherently controls the entanglement\u2010swapping topology\u2014i.e. places the network\u2019s wiring in a quantum superposition. By encoding the switch control in an extra single photon and performing a joint measurement on two Bell\u2010pair halves plus that control photon in a metasurface multiport, we can herald two distinct connectivity patterns (direct swap vs. crossed\u2010swap) or even a superposition of them, without any dynamic feed\u2010forward.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cSingle-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement the Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network, a purely linear-optical, non-factorizable tensor-network contraction that directly measures the MPS string-order operator \u27e8\u03c8|Z\u2081X\u2082\u2026X\u2099\u208b\u2081Z\u2099|\u03c8\u27e9 in one heralded entanglement-swapping step. Using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, fixed beam splitters to inject local Z- and X-twists, and photon-number-resolving detection with post-selection, the resulting click pattern yields the string-order expectation as a scalable quantum-kernel feature for symmetry-protected phase classification.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3.

    "output": "Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine optical metasurfaces and dielectric photonic crystals into a Pytheus\u2010compatible quantum network primitive (no forbidden state generation):\n 1) One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation by a fused 4-photon metasurface measurement with photonic-crystal delays (earlier idea).\n 2) Wavelength-multiplexed teleportation switchboard to two receivers via a metasurface multiport and photonic-crystal demultiplexer (earlier idea).\n 3) Indefinite-causal-order entanglement swapping: place two sequential Bell measurements in a quantum superposition of orders, using a control photon to route the shared photon through two Bell-swap modules in a superposed path, recombined by a metasurface, with photonic-crystal chips providing static delays and spectral routing.\n\nStep 2: Only (3) remains novel\u2014neither standard teleportation nor simple switchboard captures indefinite causal order in a network.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

A promising direction is to implement an all\u2010linear\u2010optics \u201cquantum switch\u201d that coherently controls the entanglement\u2010swapping topology\u2014i.e. places the network\u2019s wiring in a quantum superposition. By encoding the switch control in an extra single photon and performing a joint measurement on two Bell\u2010pair halves plus that control photon in a metasurface multiport, we can herald two distinct connectivity patterns (direct swap vs. crossed\u2010swap) or even a superposition of them, without any dynamic feed\u2010forward. A photonic\u2010crystal chip provides on\u2010chip delay, wavelength routing and narrowband filtering so that all photons arrive indistinguishably at the metasurface.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping.

The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements.

Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding.

By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs.

The composite Kraus map K\u2080\u00b3K\u2080\u00b2K\u2080\u00b9 imprints a genuinely non-unitary, non-Abelian holonomic rotation on the qubit\u2019s Bloch sphere that cannot be decomposed into mere phase shifts or attenuation, thereby demonstrating a new class of network-induced quantum holonomies.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Spatiotemporal Bilocality Test in a Three-Node Linear-Optics Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fully static spatiotemporal bilocality test by employing two independent time-bin\u2013labelled Bell-pair sources at the central station and mixing their temporal modes in a fixed 2\u00d72 interferometer, dispatching photon halves to spatial nodes A and C while heralding at B. By targeting the observed joint detection correlations across spatial nodes A\u2013B\u2013C and time bins m=0,1 and evaluating the bilocality parameter B against the classical bound B\u22641, we observe violations (B>1) that reveal genuine non-bilocal quantum causal structure.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer).

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors.

Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Metasurface Multiport Measurement at Node E  \n \u2022 A custom 3\u00d73 (plus vacuum ancilla inputs) linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface mixes modes 1,3,5.  \n \u2022 Modes 1 and 3 are the Bell\u2010pair halves; mode 5 is the control qubit.  \n \u2022 Three output modes feed number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2081, D\u2082, D\u2083.  \n \u2022 Heralding condition: exactly one click in D\u2081\u2013D\u2083 and no other photons.  \n   \u2013 If detector outcome pattern p\u2080 occurs, the metasurface has enacted a \u201cstandard\u201d Bell\u2010projection on (1,3), entangling 2\u21944 (A\u2013D swap).  \n   \u2013 If pattern p\u2081 occurs, the metasurface has enacted a \u201ccrossed\u201d projection, entangling 2\u21943 and 1\u21944 (A\u2013C & B\u2013D swap).  \n   \u2013 Because the control photon was in superposition, the overall network implements a coherent quantum\u2010controlled swap\u2014realizing an indefinite routing of entanglement.\n\n4. Why It\u2019s New & Generalizable  \n \u2022 Demonstrates a quantum switch: the connectivity of the network (which qubits become entangled) is coherently controlled by a third photon, all in one static measurement.  \n \u2022 Exploits metasurfaces for complex, high\u2010order multi\u2010photon unitary design and photonic crystals for integrated delay and spectral routing.  \n \u2022 Moves beyond passive state generation into active network topology control in superposition.  \n \u2022 Scales to N\u2010way routing by adding more Bell pairs, control photons, and metasurface ports; explorations of quantum causal structures become possible.\n\n5.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

A metasurface 4\u2010mode interferometer fuses the control photon plus the two photons at the chosen node, heralding entanglement on the complementary edge. The photonic\u2010crystal chip supplies three narrowband spectral channels (\u03bb\u2081,\u03bb\u2082,\u03bb\u2083), fixed relative delays and filtering so that the control and pair photons arrive indistinguishably.  \n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n \u2022 Novelty: Goes beyond line\u2010network indefinite causal order by superposing three possible swap locations in a loop, implementing a genuine triangular\u2010network quantum SWITCH.\n \u2022 Feasible in pytheus: uses three probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, one single\u2010photon emitter (control), a single static metasurface\u2010based linear optics network, number\u2010resolving detectors, and fixed photonic\u2010crystal routing/delays. No dynamic feed\u2010forward or cavity elements.\n\nStep 3: Pick (3).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it realizes a quantum superposition over three distinct entanglement\u2010swap locations in a cycle, enabling a \u201cnetwork\u2010node SWITCH\u201d on a triangular graph\u2014an unexplored multi\u2010node causal superposition primitive.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it employs only probabilistic pair sources, one single\u2010photon control emitter, a static multiport interferometer (metasurface), number\u2010resolving detectors for post\u2010selection, and a photonic\u2010crystal chip for spectral demux/routing and fixed delays.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose \u201cSuperposed\u2010Node Entanglement\u2010Swapping on a Triangular Network via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\n1.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation is not in the existing list (we only have single\u2010link swapping), uses a single static interferometer + ancilla detectors, no feedback, purely linear optics \u2192 fully Pytheus\u2010compatible.  \n  2. Multi\u2010receiver switchboard is conceptually new but requires an N+1-photon joint measurement for N receivers; for N=2 or 3 it\u2019s feasible, but complexity grows quickly.  \n  3. Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1. One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation is not in the existing list (we only have single\u2010link swapping), uses a single static interferometer + ancilla detectors, no feedback, purely linear optics \u2192 fully Pytheus\u2010compatible.  \n  2. Multi\u2010receiver switchboard is conceptually new but requires an N+1-photon joint measurement for N receivers; for N=2 or 3 it\u2019s feasible, but complexity grows quickly.  \n  3. Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

A metasurface 4\u2010mode interferometer fuses the control photon plus the two photons at the chosen node, heralding entanglement on the complementary edge. The photonic\u2010crystal chip supplies three narrowband spectral channels (\u03bb\u2081,\u03bb\u2082,\u03bb\u2083), fixed relative delays and filtering so that the control and pair photons arrive indistinguishably.  \n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n \u2022 Novelty: Goes beyond line\u2010network indefinite causal order by superposing three possible swap locations in a loop, implementing a genuine triangular\u2010network quantum SWITCH.\n \u2022 Feasible in pytheus: uses three probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, one single\u2010photon emitter (control), a single static metasurface\u2010based linear optics network, number\u2010resolving detectors, and fixed photonic\u2010crystal routing/delays. No dynamic feed\u2010forward or cavity elements.\n\nStep 3: Pick (3).\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it realizes a quantum superposition over three distinct entanglement\u2010swap locations in a cycle, enabling a \u201cnetwork\u2010node SWITCH\u201d on a triangular graph\u2014an unexplored multi\u2010node causal superposition primitive.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it employs only probabilistic pair sources, one single\u2010photon control emitter, a static multiport interferometer (metasurface), number\u2010resolving detectors for post\u2010selection, and a photonic\u2010crystal chip for spectral demux/routing and fixed delays.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose \u201cSuperposed\u2010Node Entanglement\u2010Swapping on a Triangular Network via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\n1.

Photonic\u2010Crystal Chip  \n \u2022 Implements three\u2010way wavelength\u2010demultiplexing (\u03bb\u2081,\u03bb\u2082,\u03bb\u2083), fixed on\u2010chip delays, and narrowband filtering so that the two photons of any chosen Bell pair and the control photon arrive simultaneously and indistinguishably at the metasurface inputs.\n\n3. Metasurface 4-Mode Measurement  \n \u2022 A custom 4-mode static linear-optics network on an optical metasurface mixes (pair\u2010photon 1, pair\u2010photon 2) + control photon 7 + a vacuum ancilla.  \n \u2022 Four output modes feed number-resolving detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2084.  \n \u2022 Heralding patterns:  \n   \u2013 If the control path was c\u2081 (node A) and D-pattern p\u2081 clicks, the metasurface has effected a Bell\u2010measurement on photons 5&6 (edge C\u2013A), swapping entanglement to yield A\u2013B entangled.  \n   \u2013 If c\u2082 & pattern p\u2082, then B performs the swap on (1&2), entangling B\u2013C.  \n   \u2013 If c\u2083 & pattern p\u2083, then C swaps (3&4), entangling C\u2013A.  \n Because the control photon was in superposition, all three swap\u2010locations are coherently superposed, realizing a genuine triangular\u2010network quantum SWITCH.\n\n4. Why It\u2019s Interesting & Generalizable  \n \u2022 Introduces a new quantum\u2010network primitive: superposed choice of which node performs entanglement\u2010swap in a cycle.  \n \u2022 Combines two emerging photonic platforms\u2014metasurfaces for multi-photon unitary design and photonic crystals for passive routing/delay\u2014into a single network operation.  \n \u2022 Goes beyond line\u2010network causal superpositions to a loop topology with three alternatives.  \n \u2022 Extensible to larger graphs (e.g. squares, pentagons) by adding more Bell pairs, control photons, and metasurface ports.\n\n5.

    "output": "We propose \u201cMetasurface\u2010Enabled Entanglement Purification via Nonlocal Parity Check and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\n1. Task & Why It\u2019s New  \n   \u2022 Rather than generating a special target state, we ask Pytheus to design a **nonlocal parity-check measurement** that probabilistically **purifies** two noisy Bell pairs into a single higher-fidelity Bell pair between nodes A and B.  \n   \u2022 This is a pure **quantum-network transformation** (an entanglement-distillation primitive), never before explored in the Pytheus library of swap/teleportation tasks.  \n   \u2022 We fuse two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single four-mode joint measurement\u2014implemented on an **optical metasurface**\u2014and use a **dielectric photonic-crystal chip** for on-chip delay and spectral routing, all in one static, post-selected setup (no feedback).\n\n2. Layout & Roles  \n   \u2022 **Bell pair S\u2081** emits photons 1\u21942 toward nodes A and C, at wavelength \u03bb\u2081.  \n   \u2022 **Bell pair S\u2082** emits photons 3\u21944 toward nodes C and B, at wavelength \u03bb\u2082.  \n   \u2022 Node **C** collects photons 2 & 3 and routes them through a photonic-crystal chip that:  \n     \u2013 Demultiplexes \u03bb\u2081,\u03bb\u2082,  \n     \u2013 Applies fixed delays so 2 & 3 arrive simultaneously,  \n     \u2013 Filters to single spatial/spectral modes.  \n   \u2022 The cleaned photons 2 & 3 enter four of the metasurface\u2019s input ports, together with two vacuum ancilla modes.\n\n3. Metasurface Parity\u2013Check Measurement  \n   \u2022 The metasurface is a custom 4\u00d74 linear-optics unitary that implements a **parity projection**: it clicks exactly when photons 2 & 3 had **even total photon number in a chosen basis** (i.e. project onto |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 subspace).  \n   \u2022 Its four output waveguides terminate in number-resolving detectors D\u2081\u2026D\u2084.  \n   \u2022 A heralding pattern of two simultaneous \u201cone-photon\u201d clicks (one in an \u201ceven\u201d detector, one vacuum elsewhere) signals a successful parity check.  \n\n4. Purification & Remaining Photons  \n   \u2022 Upon that herald, the remaining photons at A (mode 1) and B (mode 4) are **projected onto a purified Bell state** (their fidelity to |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 is raised), with known Pauli frame tracked offline.  \n   \u2022 All other click patterns are discarded (post-selection).\n\n5. Why It Fits Pytheus & All Constraints  \n   \u2022 **Sources**: Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources (S\u2081,S\u2082); no new state generation.  \n   \u2022 **Linear optics only**: A single static 4-mode metasurface; no cavities, no feedback.  \n   \u2022 **Detectors**: Number-resolving on the four metasurface outputs.  \n   \u2022 **Photonic crystal**: Implements only wavelength demux, fixed delays, and filtering\u2014purely passive.  \n   \u2022 **No forbidden resources**: No hyper/hybrid entanglement, no dynamic feed-forward, no user\u2010defined physical encoding.  \n\n6.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors. There should be no probabilistic pair-source that sends a photon to both\\nA&C -> [0,2]\\nA&D -> [0,3]\\nB&C -> [1,2]\\nB&D -> [1,3]\\n\\nThis would not be possible without ancillary particles (there number is given by 'num_anc'). The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

A metasurface 4\u2010mode interferometer fuses the control photon plus the two photons at the chosen node, heralding entanglement on the complementary edge. The photonic\u2010crystal chip supplies three narrowband spectral channels (\u03bb\u2081,\u03bb\u2082,\u03bb\u2083), fixed relative delays and filtering so that the control and pair photons arrive indistinguishably.  \n\nStep 2: Novelty & feasibility:\n \u2022 Novelty: Goes beyond line\u2010network indefinite causal order by superposing three possible swap locations in a loop, implementing a genuine triangular\u2010network quantum SWITCH.\n \u2022 Feasible in pytheus: uses three probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, one single\u2010photon emitter (control), a single static metasurface\u2010based linear optics network, number\u2010resolving detectors, and fixed photonic\u2010crystal routing/delays.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement.

The composite Kraus map K\u2080\u00b3K\u2080\u00b2K\u2080\u00b9 imprints a genuinely non-unitary, non-Abelian holonomic rotation on the qubit\u2019s Bloch sphere that cannot be decomposed into mere phase shifts or attenuation, thereby demonstrating a new class of network-induced quantum holonomies.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2.

    "output": "Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201coptical metasurfaces\u201d and \u201cdielectric photonic crystal\u201d into a new quantum-network experiment (no forbidden state generation):\n 1) Butterfly-network quantum network coding: perform two simultaneous teleportations in the butterfly topology using one metasurface multiport measurement, with a photonic-crystal chip providing wavelength-multiplexed routing and fixed delays.\n 2) Quantum conference key\u2010distribution primitive: use a metasurface to execute three concurrent Bell-measurements on three Bell-pair halves plus one control photon, while a photonic crystal implements spectral fan-out and delay, creating a network coding version of conference key sharing.\n 3) Three-party teleportation ring with loop superposition: superpose two different swapping paths in a triangle, combining a metasurface SWITCH with photonic crystal routing (but this is too close to prior indefinite-order ideas).\n\nStep 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n 1) Butterfly network coding is not in the existing list. It uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, two single-photon emitters (the unknown qubits), a single static metasurface multiport (6\u00d76 linear-optics network), number-resolving detectors, and a photonic-crystal chip for on-chip demux/mux, delays and filtering.

A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static Linear-Optical Analyzer for Four-Qubit Cluster-Basis Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully static, post-selected linear-optical module targeting the unambiguous discrimination of all four orthogonal four-qubit linear-cluster basis states. By mixing four signal photons with two Bell-pair ancillas in a fixed network of PBSs, 50:50 beam splitters and phase shifters, unique four-click polarization-resolved detection patterns herald which |C_{ij}\u27e9 cluster state was present without any active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

It uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, two single-photon emitters (the unknown qubits), a single static metasurface multiport (6\u00d76 linear-optics network), number-resolving detectors, and a photonic-crystal chip for on-chip demux/mux, delays and filtering. No feedback, no cavities\u2014fully Pytheus-compatible.\n 2) Conference key primitive is novel but more complex (requires 5-photon joint measurement), may be borderline for Pytheus.\n 3) Teleportation ring is just the triangle switch idea reused.\n\nStep 3: Choose the butterfly-network quantum network coding idea.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates the first all-linear-optical realization of quantum network coding (butterfly topology) for simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a congested link, using one static metasurface measurement instead of sequential swaps or feed-forward.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it requires only:\n \u2022 Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources for the four edges of the butterfly,\n \u2022 Two single-photon emitters carrying the unknown qubits at senders A and B,\n \u2022 A static 6-mode linear-optics metasurface that enacts two Bell-measurements in one shot,\n \u2022 A dielectric photonic-crystal chip to implement fixed delays, wavelength-demultiplexing/multiplexing of the two qubit channels, and narrowband filtering,\n \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for post-selection (no dynamic feedback).\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose \u201cQuantum Network Coding in a Butterfly Topology via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic-Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\n1.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nBoundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a static linear-optical circuit\u2014the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling\u2014that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch\u2019s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an \u201carea law\u201d for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target.

The composite Kraus map K\u2080\u00b3K\u2080\u00b2K\u2080\u00b9 imprints a genuinely non-unitary, non-Abelian holonomic rotation on the qubit\u2019s Bloch sphere that cannot be decomposed into mere phase shifts or attenuation, thereby demonstrating a new class of network-induced quantum holonomies.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

One\u2010step multi\u2010hop teleportation (chain teleportation) where two Bell\u2010pair links A\u2013B and B\u2013C are fused in a single metasurface\u2010enabled multiport measurement at B, eliminating feed-forward, and photonic\u2010crystal waveguides supply the delay and routing.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation \u201cswitchboard\u201d in a star network: A shares N Bell pairs with N receivers; a single metasurface multiport Bell\u2010measurement routes the unknown qubit onto any selected receiver; photonic crystals implement static spectral multiplexing for the N channels.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router for four end\u2010nodes: two sources at opposite corners, a metasurface\u2010based 4\u00d74 interferometer at the center performs either standard entanglement swapping or crossed pairing (A\u2013D and B\u2013C) under different static settings encoded in a photonic\u2010crystal chip.\n\nStep 2: Check novelty and pytheus\u2010compatibility.\n  1. Chain teleportation in one shot is not in the existing list (they only do single\u2010link swapping). It is a purely linear\u2010optics network, post\u2010selected, no dynamic feedback, just ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the 4-photon joint measurement.\n  2. Multi-destination teleportation is conceptually new but might require a high\u2010dimensional joint measurement (N+1 photons), which grows quickly\u2014still doable for small N (e.g. N=2 or 3). But complexity might be a barrier.\n  3. A four-node reconfigurable router is intriguing but may blur into a specific state generation (cross vs direct entanglement) and could be recast as multiple separate swapping tasks rather than a unified new network.\n\nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the one\u2010step multi-hop teleportation at B.  \nStep 4: This idea is novel because standard repeater/chain teleportation always splits into sequential Bell measurements with feed-forward; here we fuse two Bell measurements into one static joint measurement of four photons.  \nStep 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework: we have three photon\u2010pair sources (two Bell pairs + one unknown qubit), a single multiport interferometer node with ancilla detectors to post-select the correct joint\u2010measurement outcome, no adaptive control, only linear optics and photon counting.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nWe propose \u201cOne-Shot Two-Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nExplanation and conceptual layout:\n\n\u2013 Nodes and photons:\n  \u2022 Node A (Alice) holds an unknown qubit photon 0 plus one half (photon 1) of Bell pair S1.\n  \u2022 Node B (Repeater) holds the other half (photon 2) of S1 and one half (photon 3) of a second Bell pair S2.\n  \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds the other half (photon 4) of S2.\n\n\u2013 Resource generation:\n  \u2022 Source S1 probabilistically emits entangled pair (1\u21942).\n  \u2022 Source S2 probabilistically emits entangled pair (3\u21944).\n  \u2022 A separate single\u2010photon source prepares the unknown qubit 0.\n\n\u2013 Measurement at Node B:\n  \u2022 Photons 2 and 3 (one from each Bell pair) together with the unknown 0 all enter a single reconfigurable 4-mode linear-optics interferometer implemented via an optical metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The metasurface is designed to effect the two successive Bell projections (0\u22972 and 2\u22973) simultaneously as one 4-photon joint measurement.  \n  \u2022 Four ancilla output modes are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors. A single specific detection pattern heralds that 0 has been teleported to 4 in Node C, without any intermediate feed-forward.\n\n\u2013 Roles of photonic crystals:\n  \u2022 A dielectric photonic\u2010crystal network on chip implements static delay lines and wavelength-selective routing so that all four photons arrive simultaneous and in the correct spatial modes onto the metasurface.  \n  \u2022 The photonic crystal also filters out spurious sidebands and ensures pure single-mode operation, critical for high\u2010fidelity multi-photon interference.\n\n\u2013 Why it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n  \u2022 Demonstrates fusing multiple entanglement\u2010swapping steps into one static joint measurement, reducing the need for active switching or classical communication.  \n  \u2022 Leverages metasurfaces for complex multi-photon projections and photonic crystals for integrated timing/control\u2014two rapidly advancing photonic platforms.  \n  \u2022 Can be extended: three-hop teleportation (six-photon joint measurement), star\u2010topologies, or network repeater nodes with higher fan-out.  \n\nThis target focuses on the quantum-network task of teleportation over two segments in one \u201cshot,\u201d avoiding forbidden state generation tasks, and is well matched to pytheus\u2019s ability to optimize linear-optics networks with probabilistic sources and ancilla detectors.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The core idea of compressing two sequential Bell measurements into a single four-photon joint measurement for two-hop teleportation has already been proposed and must be substantively extended (e.g. by adding a genuinely new causal structure, higher-order topological feature, or novel resource type) to be considered for PRL.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation: fuse two sequential Bell measurements (A\u2192B and B\u2192C) into a single four\u2010photon joint measurement implemented by a metasurface, while photonic\u2010crystal waveguide arrays supply static delays and wavelength multiplexing to route all four photons simultaneously.\n  2. Multi\u2010receiver teleportation switchboard: Alice shares Bell pairs with several Bobs; a metasurface performs a multi\u2010port joint measurement that projects the unknown state onto one chosen Bob, using photonic crystals to carve out spectrally distinct channels for each Bob.\n  3. Reconfigurable entanglement router: two distant Bell\u2010pair sources send photons into a central metasurface\u2013photonic\u2010crystal chip that can switch between direct entanglement swapping (A\u2013B & C\u2013D) or crossed entanglement (A\u2013D & B\u2013C) by static tuning of the metasurface phase profile.\n\nStep 2: Novelty & Pytheus\u2010compatibility check:\n  1.

Reconfigurable router is interesting but essentially two separate swapping tasks under different settings, less unified than (1).\n\nStep 3: The most promising is (1): One\u2010shot two\u2010hop teleportation via a metasurface multiport and photonic\u2010crystal routing.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it compresses two sequential Bell\u2010measurements with feed-forward into a single static four-photon joint measurement, eliminating the need for intermediate classical communication and active switching. It leverages the rich mode-mixing capabilities of optical metasurfaces alongside photonic\u2010crystal routing and delay to engineer multi-photon interference in one block.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all additional constraints because\n  \u2022 It uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources plus one single-photon emitter (unknown qubit),  \n  \u2022 Requires a single static linear-optics interferometer (the metasurface),  \n  \u2022 Uses post\u2010selection on ancilla detectors (no feedback),  \n  \u2022 Demands only number-resolving detectors and static path delays,  \n  \u2022 Involves no forbidden hyper- or hybrid-entanglement or cavity elements.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe propose \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Quantum Teleportation via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic\u2010Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\nLayout and Roles:\n \u2022 Photon 0: unknown qubit from a single-photon emitter (Alice\u2019s input).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S1: probabilistic source emits photons 1\u21942.  \n \u2022 Bell pair S2: probabilistic source emits photons 3\u21944.  \n \u2022 Node B (Repeater) collects photons 0,2,3,1 into a single metasurface\u2010based 4-port interferometer which enacts the combined Bell-measurement on (0,1) and (2,3) simultaneously.  \n \u2022 Node C (Charlie) holds photon 4 as the teleported output.\n\nPhotonic\u2010Crystal Functions:\n \u2022 Implements on-chip static delay lines and wavelength\u2010selective routing so that photons 0,1,2,3 arrive simultaneously in the correct spatial modes at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Provides narrowband filtering and single-mode purity essential for high-visibility four-photon interference.\n\nMetasurface Measurement:\n \u2022 A designed 4-mode linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface performs the joint projection onto the product of two Bell bases in one step.  \n \u2022 Four output modes of this metasurface are monitored by number\u2010resolving detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Phase-Matching Quantum Key Distribution without Intensity Modulation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Mitigation of crosstalk and noise in multicore fiber on quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Maximal coin-walker entanglement in a ballistic quantum walk\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!

Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A promising direction is to implement an all\u2010linear\u2010optics \u201cquantum switch\u201d that coherently controls the entanglement\u2010swapping topology\u2014i.e. places the network\u2019s wiring in a quantum superposition. By encoding the switch control in an extra single photon and performing a joint measurement on two Bell\u2010pair halves plus that control photon in a metasurface multiport, we can herald two distinct connectivity patterns (direct swap vs. crossed\u2010swap) or even a superposition of them, without any dynamic feed\u2010forward. A photonic\u2010crystal chip provides on\u2010chip delay, wavelength routing and narrowband filtering so that all photons arrive indistinguishably at the metasurface.

Photonic\u2010Crystal Chip  \n \u2022 Implements static delay lines so photons 1,3,5 arrive simultaneously at the metasurface.  \n \u2022 Performs narrowband demultiplexing (if sources operate at slightly offset wavelengths) and single\u2010mode filtering to guarantee high\u2010visibility interference.\n\n3. Metasurface Multiport Measurement at Node E  \n \u2022 A custom 3\u00d73 (plus vacuum ancilla inputs) linear\u2010optics network on an optical metasurface mixes modes 1,3,5.  \n \u2022 Modes 1 and 3 are the Bell\u2010pair halves; mode 5 is the control qubit.  \n \u2022 Three output modes feed number\u2010resolving detectors D\u2081, D\u2082, D\u2083.  \n \u2022 Heralding condition: exactly one click in D\u2081\u2013D\u2083 and no other photons.  \n   \u2013 If detector outcome pattern p\u2080 occurs, the metasurface has enacted a \u201cstandard\u201d Bell\u2010projection on (1,3), entangling 2\u21944 (A\u2013D swap).  \n   \u2013 If pattern p\u2081 occurs, the metasurface has enacted a \u201ccrossed\u201d projection, entangling 2\u21943 and 1\u21944 (A\u2013C & B\u2013D swap).  \n   \u2013 Because the control photon was in superposition, the overall network implements a coherent quantum\u2010controlled swap\u2014realizing an indefinite routing of entanglement.\n\n4. Why It\u2019s New & Generalizable  \n \u2022 Demonstrates a quantum switch: the connectivity of the network (which qubits become entangled) is coherently controlled by a third photon, all in one static measurement.  \n \u2022 Exploits metasurfaces for complex, high\u2010order multi\u2010photon unitary design and photonic crystals for integrated delay and spectral routing.  \n \u2022 Moves beyond passive state generation into active network topology control in superposition.  \n \u2022 Scales to N\u2010way routing by adding more Bell pairs, control photons, and metasurface ports; explorations of quantum causal structures become possible.\n\n5.

Overview & Roles  \n \u2022 Bell pair S\u2081 produces photons 1\u21942 (A\u2013B).  \n \u2022 Bell pair S\u2082 produces photons 3\u21944 (B\u2013C).  \n \u2022 Control photon 5 (single-photon emitter) is prepared in |+\u27e9 and split into two spatial modes c\u2080, c\u2081 by a beam splitter.  \n \u2022 Path c\u2080 routes photon 5 into the subcircuit M\u2081\u2192M\u2082 (do A\u2013B swap then B\u2013C swap).  \n \u2022 Path c\u2081 routes photon 5 into M\u2082\u2192M\u2081 (do B\u2013C swap then A\u2013B swap).  \n\n2. Photonic-Crystal Chip  \n \u2022 Implements fixed optical delays so that photons 1\u20135 arrive simultaneously at the metasurface inputs.  \n \u2022 Performs coarse wavelength demultiplexing if S\u2081, S\u2082 operate at slightly different \u03bb, and narrowband single-mode filtering to ensure high interference contrast.  \n\n3. Metasurface SWITCH Measurement  \n \u2022 A 4-mode static linear-optics network on an optical metasurface mixes the two Bell-pair halves from whichever order was chosen (photons 1 & 3 after the routing delays) together with control mode 5 and one vacuum ancilla.  \n \u2022 Four output modes feed number-resolving detectors D\u2081\u2013D\u2084.  \n \u2022 Heralding patterns:  \n   \u2013 If D-click pattern p\u2080 occurs, the metasurface has enacted the SWITCH operation in the \u201cM\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u201d branch, coherently swapping entanglement A\u2013B then B\u2013C (yielding A\u2013C entangled).  \n   \u2013 If D-click pattern p\u2081 occurs, it enacted \u201cM\u2082\u2192M\u2081\u201d (B\u2013C then A\u2013B), also yielding A\u2013C entangled.  \n Thanks to the control-photon superposition, the two orders are in coherent superposition\u2014realizing an entanglement-swapping SWITCH in one static measurement.  \n\n4. Why It\u2019s Interesting & Generalizable  \n \u2022 First optical demonstration of a quantum SWITCH applied to entanglement swapping\u2014a fundamentally new network primitive where the causal order of two swap steps is in superposition.  \n \u2022 Combines two cutting-edge photonic platforms: metasurfaces for complex multi-photon unitaries and photonic crystals for integrated delay & spectral routing.  \n \u2022 Purely linear-optical, uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon control, static metasurface + ancilla detectors, and no feed-forward.  \n \u2022 Directly extensible to longer chains (one-shot multi-order SWITCH with N swap steps) or richer network topologies.  \n\n5.

It uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, two single-photon emitters (the unknown qubits), a single static metasurface multiport (6\u00d76 linear-optics network), number-resolving detectors, and a photonic-crystal chip for on-chip demux/mux, delays and filtering. No feedback, no cavities\u2014fully Pytheus-compatible.\n 2) Conference key primitive is novel but more complex (requires 5-photon joint measurement), may be borderline for Pytheus.\n 3) Teleportation ring is just the triangle switch idea reused.\n\nStep 3: Choose the butterfly-network quantum network coding idea.\n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates the first all-linear-optical realization of quantum network coding (butterfly topology) for simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a congested link, using one static metasurface measurement instead of sequential swaps or feed-forward.\n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it requires only:\n \u2022 Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources for the four edges of the butterfly,\n \u2022 Two single-photon emitters carrying the unknown qubits at senders A and B,\n \u2022 A static 6-mode linear-optics metasurface that enacts two Bell-measurements in one shot,\n \u2022 A dielectric photonic-crystal chip to implement fixed delays, wavelength-demultiplexing/multiplexing of the two qubit channels, and narrowband filtering,\n \u2022 Number-resolving detectors for post-selection (no dynamic feedback).\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nWe propose \u201cQuantum Network Coding in a Butterfly Topology via a Metasurface Multiport and Photonic-Crystal Routing.\u201d\n\n1.
