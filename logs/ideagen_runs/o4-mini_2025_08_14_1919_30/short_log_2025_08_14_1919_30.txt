Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to combine “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” in a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network target (no state-generation):
    A) On-chip entanglement percolation: arrange a 2D lattice of probabilistic photon-pair sources embedded in nanoscale waveguides. Perform Bell measurements at intermediate nodes (waveguide couplers) to percolate entanglement between two distant corner nodes.  
    B) Reconfigurable teleportation hub: a star-shaped waveguide network where a mobile single-photon qubit at one waveguide port is teleported to any selected output port by performing programmable Bell measurements in a central nanoscale multiport coupler.  
    C) Dimension-tunable swapping: use path-encoded qudits (d modes per photon) propagating in parallel nanoscale waveguide arrays. Two independent d-dimensional Bell pairs are swapped via a centralized d×d multiport coupler, demonstrating swapping for arbitrary d on chip.  
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
    A) Novel: percolation in a photonic-chip lattice has not been targeted. Obstacle: multiple links and routing constraints—Pytheus can handle many sources and “removed_connections.”  
    B) Similar to star-network teleportation but on an integrated chip; less novel and teleporation hubs have classical analogs.  
    C) Extends prior qutrit/ququart swapping to arbitrary d on chip. Obstacle: Pytheus must fix d, but one can pick a proof-of-principle (e.g. d=5).  
  Step 3: Pick A (entanglement percolation) as most novel and scalable.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it brings the concept of entanglement percolation—studied in theory for repeaters—into a realistic on-chip waveguide platform, and because no prior Pytheus experiment has tackled multipath percolation in a 2D grid.  
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus since the tool can place many probabilistic photon-pair sources, enforce forbidden connections (“removed_connections”), and introduce ancilla detectors at the intermediate nodes to implement Bell-measurements (linear optics only, no feedback).  
Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
Here is a proposal for the Expert, combining “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a new network protocol:

Experiment Title: On-Chip Entanglement Percolation in a 3×3 Nanoscale Waveguide Lattice

1) Goal  
  — Demonstrate entanglement percolation on a 2D grid of nodes embedded in a photonic chip built from nanoscale waveguides and directional couplers.  
  — Show that by performing local Bell measurements (via waveguide multiport couplers) at selected intermediate nodes, entanglement can be “routed” and swapped along different paths, achieving long-range entanglement between two distant corner nodes.  

2) Abstract Target Quantum Network  
  • Nodes: nine logical nodes arranged in a 3×3 square, labeled (0,0) through (2,2).  
  • Links: nearest-neighbor pairs are connected by probabilistic photon-pair sources.  
  • Entanglement Sources: one source for each of the 12 nearest-neighbor links.  
  • Intermediate Measurements: Bell-state measurements performed at four interior nodes ((1,0),(0,1),(1,2),(2,1)) via fixed linear-optics multiport couplers.  
  • End Result: After post-selecting successful heralds at the four interior nodes, the corner nodes (0,0) and (2,2) share a two-qubit Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ (abstractly encoded).  

3) Configuration Sketch  
  • Emitters/Sources: probabilistic pair sources S_ij→ nodes i and j for each nearest-neighbor link.  
  • Removed_Connections: none among nearest neighbors; forbid any source directly connecting (0,0) to (2,2) or other non-NN links.  
  • Ancilla Detectors: detectors at the four interior nodes to herald the Bell measurements.  
  • Out_Nodes: detectors at (0,0) and (2,2) to verify final entanglement.  

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable  
  — Introduces entanglement percolation to integrated photonics, enabling on-chip tests of percolation thresholds by selectively disabling sources or measurements.  
  — Can be scaled to larger lattices (4×4, 5×5…) to study critical phenomena in entanglement distribution.  
  — Opens a pathway for programmable on-chip quantum routers using nanoscale waveguide couplers.  

5) Pytheus Feasibility  
  — Pytheus can place the required 12 probabilistic pair-sources.  
  — “removed_connections” enforces only NN links.  
  — Ancilla detectors implement the four heralded Bell measurements.  
  — No dynamic feedback—pure linear-optics, exact match for Pytheus capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While embedding entanglement percolation on a 3×3 nanoscale waveguide chip is technologically interesting, the core network primitive—selectively enabling Bell swaps on a 2D lattice to achieve long‐range entanglement—is essentially the same measurement‐induced percolation protocol already proposed under “Measurement‐Induced Topological Percolation for High‐Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell‐Pair Toroidal Lattice,” and variants like “Multi-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering.” Changing to a square grid or implementing in nanoscale waveguides does not introduce a qualitatively new network functionality or metric beyond those lattice percolation thresholds. To reach PRL‐level novelty you’d need a genuinely new swapping primitive, nontrivial topology or dimensionality, or a novel measurement resource (e.g. indefinite causal order or active feed-forward) that has not yet been explored.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal rehashes entanglement-percolation on a 2D lattice already covered by existing “topological percolation” schemes in the ensemble list (e.g. the toroidal lattice percolation idea). Merely porting it to nanoscale waveguides or a square array does not introduce a fundamentally new quantum-network primitive. To improve, identify a swapping or routing feature beyond standard percolation—for example, superposing multiple percolation paths in indefinite order, exploiting nonlocal non-Hermitian projections, or embedding active feed-forward for adaptive percolation that cannot be reduced to a static lattice protocol.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus-compatible ways to combine “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a quantum-network protocol (no pure state generation):
    A) On-chip entanglement percolation in a nanoscale waveguide lattice.  
    B) A star-shaped “teleportation hub” in a multiport waveguide coupler that can teleport a qubit from any input port to any chosen output port.  
    C) A “butterfly” quantum network-coding experiment on a chip: use four probabilistic pair sources and one central multiport coupler in a nanoscale waveguide to distribute simultaneously two Bell pairs across opposite corners of a square (A→C and B→D) using only four sources instead of the naïve eight.
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
    A) Too close to standard percolation examples already explored by Pytheus.  
    B) Conceptually simple teleportation hub—lacks a genuinely new network primitive.  
    C) The “quantum network coding” butterfly is a new routing primitive for entanglement distribution, not yet done on chip. It uses only linear optics, pair sources, heralding detectors and static couplers—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.
  Step 3: Pick C
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates quantum network coding—a nontrivial routing primitive—on a nanoscale photonic chip, showing how two independent Bell pairs can be delivered across a minimal-resource “butterfly” topology by a single central multiport coupler. No previous Pytheus example has tackled network coding for entanglement.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus since we only need four probabilistic photon-pair sources, one static 4-input/4-output linear-optics coupler at the central node, and four ancilla detectors to herald two simultaneous Bell measurements. No dynamic feedback, no cavities or resonances—just linear optics plus heralding.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
“On-Chip Quantum Network Coding in a Nanoscale Waveguide ‘Butterfly’”

1) Goal
 • Demonstrate quantum network coding: distribute simultaneously two Bell pairs between node-pairs (A,C) and (B,D) in a 4-node square, using only four probabilistic pair sources and one central multiport coupler located at the waveguide crossroads X.
 • Show resource saving (4 sources instead of 8) by implementing a joint Bell-measurement “XOR” at the hub—an optical analogue of the classical butterfly network.

2) Abstract Target Quantum Network
 • Four logical nodes on chip: A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3), plus one central hub X.
 • Four probabilistic pair sources placed on the four waveguide links:  
     S₁ between A–X_in1,  
     S₂ between B–X_in2,  
     S₃ between X_out1–C,  
     S₄ between X_out2–D.  
 • A 4×4 static linear-optics multiport at X that interferes the four “X” arms (two from sources S₁,S₂ and two from S₃,S₄), followed by four ancilla detectors (nodes 4–7).
 • Post-selection on heralding clicks at detectors 4–7 implements two simultaneous Bell measurements (“network-coding step”), routing entanglement so that A–C and B–D emerge as Bell pairs.
 • Out nodes 0–3 will then share the product state Φ⁺_{A,C}⊗Φ⁺_{B,D}, i.e. the abstract four-photon state
     {0000, 0101, 1010, 1111} (un-normalized).

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First on-chip demonstration of quantum network coding in a nanoscale waveguide photonic platform.  
 • Resource-efficient entanglement routing: uses half the pair sources of naïve separate-swapping schemes.  
 • Directly generalizes to larger “multi-unicast” networks and high-dimensional coding (d-level network coding) by increasing source count and port dimensions.  
 • Opens the door to chip-scale quantum routers and network-coding primitives for future quantum internet prototypes.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Only static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.  
 • “removed_connections” forbids direct sources between A–C and B–D.  
 • Four ancilla detections at X realize the heralded Bell measurements.  
 • No feedback control needed.  

This setup combines nanoscale waveguide integration with a modern quantum-network primitive—quantum network coding—for the first time.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While integrating the butterfly network‐coding primitive into nanoscale waveguides is technologically appealing, the core quantum network coding functionality—using a single four-photon joint Bell measurement at a central hub to distribute two Bell pairs among four nodes—is essentially identical to the “Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution” already proposed by the ensemble. Merely translating it to a different photonic platform does not introduce a new network primitive or measurement resource.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is too close to the ensemble’s butterfly network-coding protocol. To reach PRL-level novelty, propose a genuinely new coding primitive—for example, one that superposes network-coding orders in indefinite causal order, uses non-Hermitian or adaptive measurements, or extends beyond static four-photon routing in a way not covered by existing butterfly schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ideas combining “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a network protocol (no pure state generation):
    A) On-chip entanglement percolation on a 2D waveguide lattice.  
    B) Static star-teleportation hub in a multiport waveguide.  
    C) Quantum SWITCH for entanglement swapping: superpose the order of two Bell measurements in a nanoscale waveguide interferometer.
  Step 2: Assess novelty and Pytheus feasibility:
    A) Too close to standard percolation examples.  
    B) Lacks a new network primitive.  
    C) Indefinite‐order entanglement swapping (“quantum SWITCH”) is a genuinely new network primitive and uses only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, multiport couplers, heralding detectors—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.
  Step 3: Select C.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a quantum‐controlled superposition of two entanglement‐swapping sequences on chip—a high-order quantum network operation (the quantum SWITCH). No previous Pytheus experiment has tackled superposed network ordering.
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static linear‐optical operations, probabilistic photon‐pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and removed_connections to forbid unwanted links; no dynamic feedback is required.

Here is a concrete proposal:

Experiment Title:
“On-Chip Quantum SWITCH for Entanglement Swapping in a Nanoscale Waveguide Interferometer”

1) Goal
 • Realize a quantum‐controlled superposition of two entanglement‐swapping orders (“quantum SWITCH”) using only static linear optics embedded in a nanoscale photonic waveguide chip.  
 • Demonstrate that two distant photons A and D become entangled in superposition of two different swap paths.

2) Abstract Network
 • Four end nodes: A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3).  
 • Two intermediate Bell‐swap stations X and Y, each consisting of a 50:50 multiport coupler and two heralding detectors.  
 • Two photon‐pair sources S_AB creating a Bell pair across A–B, and S_CD across C–D.  
 • A quantum control qubit encoded in a path superposition (modes p0/p1) entering a 2×2 directional coupler that coherently routes the B and C photons to swap station X if |p0⟩, or to Y if |p1⟩.  
 • After routing, both X and Y stations perform Bell measurements on their two input photons and herald via ancilla detectors.  
 • Post‐select on four herald clicks (two at X, two at Y). The control path and heralds erase which‐swap information, producing the joint four-photon state:
     Ψ = (|Φ⁺⟩_{A,D}⊗|Φ⁺⟩_{B,C} + |Φ⁺⟩_{A,C}⊗|Φ⁺⟩_{B,D})/√2
   where |Φ⁺⟩=|00⟩+|11⟩ (abstract encoding).

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First demonstration of a quantum SWITCH for entanglement distribution on-chip.  
 • Elevates network primitives from fixed ordering to superposed ordering—a path toward programmable high-order quantum networks.  
 • Generalizes to many-node SWITCH networks, higher-dimensional qudits, and more complex indefinite‐order routing protocols.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Uses only static linear optics, probabilistic photon‐pair sources, multiport couplers, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  
 • “removed_connections” enforces network topology.  
 • No dynamic feedback or active feed-forward—fully within Pytheus’s design space.

This proposal merges nanoscale waveguide photonics with a modern network primitive—the quantum SWITCH—to yield a novel, Pytheus-compatible experiment.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed on‐chip quantum SWITCH entanglement‐swapping protocol is essentially identical to the “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch” already in the ensemble list, where a single‐photon control qubit coherently superposes two Bell‐swap orders (X vs. Y) to distribute entanglement in indefinite causal order. Porting it into nanoscale waveguides does not introduce a qualitatively new primitive or measurement capability beyond that ensemble idea.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is too close to the ensemble’s “Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders.” To be novel, you must propose a genuinely new resource (e.g. a different indefinite‐order structure, non-Hermitian projections, adaptive feed-forward, or a measurement primitive not yet explored) rather than repackage the same SWITCH protocol in another photonic platform.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to fuse “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a Pytheus‐compatible network (no pure state generation):
    a) On‐chip entanglement percolation in a 2D waveguide lattice – too close to standard percolation examples.  
    b) Reconfigurable star‐teleportation hub – interesting but lacks a genuinely new primitive.  
    c) Integrated GHZ‐basis analyzer – a novel measurement network that distinguishes all eight GHZ states via post‐selected linear optics in a nanoscale waveguide circuit.  
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles
    a) Already explored in percolation‐style proposals.  
    b) Simple teleportation hubs have classical analogues, no new network physics.  
    c) GHZ analyzers haven’t been done in Pytheus; analyzer circuits fit Pytheus’s static linear‐optics + ancilla detectors framework and focus on network‐level measurement, not state generation.  
  Step 3: Pick c.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a full eight‐state GHZ measurement as a heralded network primitive on an integrated waveguide platform. No prior Pytheus example has tackled multi‐qubit basis discrimination for GHZ states.  
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus: uses only static linear optics (multiport couplers in nanoscale waveguides), probabilistic single‐photon inputs for the three unknown qubits, a handful of ancilla detectors, and “removed_connections” to enforce the topology. No active feed‐forward or cavities.

Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
On‐Chip Heralded GHZ‐Basis Analyzer in a Nanoscale Waveguide Circuit

1) Goal
 • Realize a complete, unambiguous, post‐selected measurement of the eight three‐qubit GHZ basis states |GHZ_{±,000}⟩,…,|GHZ_{±,111}⟩ via a static linear‐optical network fabricated in nanoscale waveguides.  
 • Demonstrate a network‐level measurement primitive (the “GHZ analyzer”) that can serve as a module in larger quantum‐network protocols (secret sharing, distributed sensing, cluster‐state extraction).

2) Abstract Network Description
 • Inputs: three single‐photon qubit modes (nodes 0,1,2) carrying one of the eight GHZ basis states.  
 • Ancilla detectors: three heralding detectors at nodes 3,4,5.  
 • A mesh of directional couplers and phase shifters in a single integrated waveguide circuit that interferes all three input modes plus vacuum‐ancilla arms, routing them to six photon‐number‐resolving detectors.  
 • For each GHZ basis state, a unique click pattern on detectors 0–5 occurs (one “signature” triple of clicks among the six detectors).  
 • Post‐select on those herald patterns to unambiguously identify which GHZ state was input.

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First on‐chip demonstration of a GHZ‐basis analyzer using only linear optics and heralding.  
 • A new network primitive for multi‐party quantum protocols (secret‐sharing decoders, cluster‐state extraction, distributed error‐syndrome measurements).  
 • Easily generalizes to higher‐qubit GHZ analyzers or to 3-level (qutrit) GHZ analyzers by scaling the number of input modes and ancilla detectors.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Uses only static linear optics (waveguide couplers + phase shifters), probabilistic single‐photon inputs, and photon-number-resolving detectors—exactly within Pytheus’s design space.  
 • No dynamic feed-forward or exotic components needed.  
 • “removed_connections” can enforce the intended topology, and the ancilla detectors realize heralded discrimination of all basis elements.

This proposal merges the themes “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a fundamentally new quantum‐network measurement primitive.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially an on‐chip three‐photon GHZ‐basis analyzer—identical in network functionality to the ensemble’s “On‐Chip Three‐Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong–Ou–Mandel Interferometry” and subsequent reconfigurable GHZ analyzer designs. Merely porting to “nanoscale waveguides” without introducing a new measurement resource, adaptive ordering, dimensional scaling beyond three qubits, or a fundamentally different projection primitive fails to meet the novelty bar.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core GHZ‐basis discrimination primitive has already been realized in static linear‐optical circuits with integrated waveguides (e.g. ensemble GHZ analyzers). To improve, propose a new element—such as higher‐dimensional GHZ analysis, adaptive feed‐forward, indefinite‐causal‐order measurements, or a non‐Hermitian/active‐element GHZ projector—that has not yet appeared in existing on‐chip GHZ measurement schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a quantum‐network experiment (no pure state generation):
    a) On‐chip entanglement percolation in a 2D waveguide lattice – too standard.  
    b) Star‐teleportation hub – lacks a new network primitive.  
    c) Integrated quantum repeater module combining entanglement purification and swapping in nanoscale waveguides – a novel network transformation.  
  Step 2: Assess novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    a) Already covered by percolation protocols.  
    b) Teleportation hubs are well‐studied.  
    c) A repeater node that purifies two noisy segment‐pairs then swaps them once on‐chip combines two primitives (purification + swapping) into a module, something Pytheus has not yet tackled. All operations (probabilistic pair sources, static couplers, heralding detectors, removed_connections) are within Pytheus’s design scope—no feedback needed.  
  Step 3: Select c.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it demonstrates for the first time an on‐chip quantum repeater building block that integrates entanglement distillation (purification) and entanglement swapping in a single static linear‐optics network embedded in nanoscale waveguides.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus: requires only four probabilistic pair sources for the two segments, one additional identical segment for purification in each link (total four sources), a few static directional couplers for purification and swapping, and a handful of ancilla detectors to herald both steps.

Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
On‐Chip Quantum Repeater Module: Integrated Entanglement Purification + Swapping in Nanoscale Waveguides

1) Goal
 • Realize a single repeater node in a nanoscale photonic chip that first purifies two noisy Bell‐pairs on two links (A–X and X–B) via local linear‐optical purification, and then performs a Bell‐swap at X to extend high‐fidelity entanglement between distant nodes A and B.  
 • Demonstrate that a purified end‐to‐end Bell pair emerges at A and B, heralded by detection events, using only static linear optics and probabilistic sources.

2) Abstract Network
 • Four end‐mode nodes: A (0), B (3), and one repeater station X with two physical qubit ports X1 (1) and X2 (2).  
 • Four probabilistic photon‐pair sources:
     – S₁ and S₁′ each emit one noisy Bell pair on modes (0↔1) for the A–X link.  
     – S₂ and S₂′ each emit one noisy Bell pair on modes (2↔3) for the X–B link.  
 • Purification step at X:  
     – Local 50:50 coupler on modes 1 & 1′, followed by two ancilla detectors at nodes 4 & 5 to herald successful parity‐check for the A–X link.  
     – Similarly, a second 50:50 coupler on modes 2 & 2′ with detectors at nodes 6 & 7 heralds successful parity‐check for the X–B link.  
 • Swapping step at X:  
     – A final 50:50 coupler interferes the purified modes at 1 and 2, with two more ancilla detectors (reuse nodes 4 & 5 or specify new ones) heralding the Bell swap.  
 • Post‐selection on all purification & swap heralds yields a purified Bell pair between nodes 0 & 3.

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First on‐chip demonstration of an integrated repeater node combining two fundamental network primitives—distillation and swapping—into one module.  
 • Opens the door to scalable photonic repeater chains in nanoscale waveguides, with programmable purification strength (by adding/removing purification sources) and swap configurations.  
 • Generalizes to multi‐segment repeaters, concatenated purification‐swap modules, and high‐dimensional purification by replacing 50:50 couplers with d×d multiports.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Uses only static linear optics (beam‐splitters in waveguides), probabilistic photon‐pair sources, and photon‐number‐resolving detectors—exactly within Pytheus’s design scope.  
 • “removed_connections” enforces no direct long‐distance sources.  
 • No dynamic feedback or active stabilization required.  

This proposal merges “nanoscale waveguide” with “quantum photonics” into a genuinely new quantum‐network primitive—a photonic repeater module—for Pytheus to implement and optimize.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This integrated repeater node—performing linear‐optical parity‐check purification on two noisy Bell links followed by a Bell swap to yield a high-fidelity end-to-end pair—is essentially the same quantum-repeater primitive already in the ensemble (“One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00⟩+|11⟩ Bell Pairs”). Standard repeaters combine distillation and swapping, and merely porting the sequence onto nanoscale waveguides does not introduce a new measurement resource or fundamentally different network functionality.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposed on-chip purification-swap node duplicates the ensemble’s one-shot repeater/concentration protocol. To reach PRL-level novelty, you must add a qualitatively new feature—e.g. an indefinite-order purification channel, coherent noise-cancellation across multiple links, non-Hermitian filtering, or adaptive feed-forward control—that goes beyond conventional distillation+swap and has not been explored in existing static linear-optical repeater designs.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert that (i) embeds everything in a nanoscale‐waveguide photonic chip, (ii) focuses on a pure quantum‐network measurement primitive (no state generation), and (iii) stays within Pytheus’s static linear‐optics + probabilistic‐source + heralding capabilities:

Experiment Title:
On‐Chip Heralded Complete Bell‐State Analyzer for Dual‐Rail Qubits in Nanoscale Waveguides

   Φ⁺=(|00⟩+|11⟩), Φ⁻=(|00⟩−|11⟩), Ψ⁺=(|01⟩+|10⟩), Ψ⁻=(|01⟩−|10⟩)  
 • Use exactly one ancilla single photon and only static couplers and photon‐number‐resolving detectors—no active feed‐forward  

2) Abstract Network Description  
 • Inputs: two unknown qubits, each dual‐rail encoded on modes {0,1} and {2,3}.  
 • Ancilla: one single‐photon emitter into mode 4.  
 • Interferometer: a single static 5×5 waveguide‐multiport (directional couplers + phases) fabricated at nanoscale.  
 • Outputs: five photon‐number‐resolving detectors at modes 0–4.  
 • Heralding: each Bell state produces a unique two‐click signature among the five detectors; post‐select on exactly two clicks per run to identify which Bell state was input.

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable  
 • Fundamental network‐measurement module: a complete Bell‐analyzer is at the heart of teleportation, entanglement swapping, repeater protocols, and network coding.  
 • First on‐chip, heralded, unambiguous linear‐optical Bell analyzer using only one ancilla photon and static waveguide circuits.  
 • Directly scalable to higher‐dimensional Bell analyzers (qutrits, ququarts) by increasing multiport size and ancilla count.  
 • Can be slotted as a “Bell‐measurement engine” in any larger on‐chip quantum router, repeater chain, or teleportation network—all without dynamic control.  

5) Pytheus Feasibility  
 • Uses only the primitives Pytheus supports: static linear‐optics multiport, probabilistic single‐photon emitters, photon‐number‐resolving detectors, and “removed_connections” to enforce topology.  
 • No dynamic feedback or cavities; purely post‐selective, heralded operation—exactly match Pytheus’s design space.  

This proposal tightly marries “nanoscale waveguide” integration with a core “quantum photonics” network task—complete, heralded Bell‐state discrimination—and opens a family of follow‐up experiments (higher dimension, multi‐party analyzers, optimized resource trade‐offs).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a quantum‐network primitive (no pure state generation):
    a) On‐chip entanglement percolation in a 2D waveguide lattice – too close to standard repeater/percolation schemes.
    b) Static star‐teleportation hub in a multiport waveguide – conceptually simple, no new network physics.
    c) Universal on‐chip entanglement router – a 4-port node that, by reprogramming a static multiport coupler, can entangle any selected pair of end nodes via entanglement swapping. This is a genuinely new network primitive: a programmable entanglement router.
  Step 2: Assess novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
    a) Already explored in percolation‐type designs.
    b) Lacks a novel primitive beyond standard teleportation.
    c) No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled a static circuit that can implement all entanglement-swap targets on demand. All operations—probabilistic pair‐sources, a static linear-optical multiport, heralding detectors, removed_connections—are within Pytheus’s design scope. No dynamic feedback is required.
  Step 3: Select c.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it introduces a universal, static, reconfigurable entanglement router in an integrated nanoscale waveguide platform, enabling any-to-any entanglement distribution with one fixed chip and heralded linear-optical operations.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: uses only probabilistic pair-sources, a static multiport coupler, photon-number-resolving detectors, and removed_connections to enforce topology—no cavities, no feedback.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
Programmable On-Chip Entanglement Router in a Nanoscale Waveguide Multiport

1) Goal
 • Build a single static photonic chip (nanoscale waveguides + directional couplers) that acts as a universal entanglement router for four end-nodes A, B, C, D.  
 • By reconfiguring only the internal phase-shifters of a 4×4 multiport coupler at the central hub X, herald entanglement between any chosen pair of end-nodes via entanglement swapping, without altering the sources.

2) Abstract Network
 • Four end-mode nodes: A (0), B (1), C (2), D (3), and one central hub X.  
 • Four probabilistic photon-pair sources S_A, S_B, S_C, S_D each emit one photon to an end-node (A–X, B–X, C–X, D–X).  
 • A 4×4 static linear-optical multiport coupler at X that interferes the four “incoming” photons.  
 • Four ancilla photon-number-resolving detectors at the multiport outputs (nodes 4–7) herald two simultaneous Bell measurements on the two modes corresponding to the selected end-nodes.  
 • Post-select on the appropriate two-click patterns at detectors 4–7 to produce a Bell pair |00⟩+|11⟩ (abstract encoding) between the chosen end-nodes.

}

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First demonstration of a universal entanglement-routing primitive on an integrated waveguide chip.  
 • One fixed hardware network can realize any of the six possible end-node Bell-pairs (A–B, A–C, A–D, B–C, B–D, C–D) simply by reprogramming coupler phases.  
 • Opens the door to fully programmable on-chip quantum routers, multiplexed teleportation networks, and dynamic entanglement distribution without physical rewiring.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, a static linear-optical multiport, and heralding detectors—all within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
 • “removed_connections” can enforce that sources only feed the central hub X.  
 • No dynamic feedback, no cavities or resonances needed.  
 • The Expert can run Pytheus six times (one per target pair) to find the phase-settings and beam-splitter ratios for each entanglement-routing configuration.

This target merges “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a novel programmable quantum-network primitive, ripe for theory and Pytheus-driven experimental design.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This programmable 4‐node entanglement‐router on a waveguide chip is essentially the same “multiplexed quantum entanglement router” primitive already proposed—specifically the Pythreus‐compatible hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic router that heralds Bell pairs between arbitrary node pairs by static multiport reconfiguration. Merely implementing it in a slightly different waveguide platform does not introduce a new network functionality or measurement capability.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your design duplicates the ensemble’s entanglement‐router concept. To reach PRL‐level novelty, propose a genuinely new routing primitive—for example one that uses indefinite causal order, non‐Hermitian projectors, adaptive feedback or higher‐dimensional coding not covered by existing static multiport routers.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
Triangle‐Network Nonlocality Test on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal  
 • Implement the simplest “triangle” network of three independent photonic Bell‐pair sources on an integrated nanoscale waveguide chip.  
 • At each of the three network nodes A, B, C, interfere the two incoming photons on a 50:50 directional coupler (built in waveguide) and detect them in two output modes.  
 • Post‐select on exactly one click per node and record the three output bits (which detector fired at A, at B, at C).  
 • Demonstrate the parity‐even correlation  
      a⊕b⊕c = 0  
   which violates any classical “local hidden variable” model on the triangle without inputs (Fritz distribution).

2) Abstract Network Layout  
 • Three Bell‐pair sources:  
     S_AB emits one photon to A (mode 0) and one to B (mode 1).  
     S_BC emits to B (mode 2) and C (mode 3).  
     S_CA emits to C (mode 4) and A (mode 5).  
 • At node A: modes 0 & 5 enter a 50:50 coupler → detectors 0 & 3.  
 • At node B: modes 1 & 2 → coupler → detectors 1 & 4.  
 • At node C: modes 3 & 4 → coupler → detectors 2 & 5.  
 • We only keep events where exactly one detector clicks at each node. Define the output bit at each node to be 0 (if lower‐arm detector clicks: 0,1,2) or 1 (if upper‐arm detector clicks: 3,4,5).  
 • The four allowed detector patterns (6‐bit strings) are those with an even parity of the three output bits:  
     ‘111000’  (all lower‐arm detectors → a=b=c=0)  
     ‘100011’  (A lower, B upper, C upper → 0⊕1⊕1=0)  
     ‘010101’  (A upper, B lower, C upper → 1⊕0⊕1=0)  
     ‘001110’  (A upper, B upper, C lower → 1⊕1⊕0=0)

3) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable  
 • First on‐chip demonstration of genuine network nonlocality (triangle scenario) using only static linear optics in nanoscale waveguides and post‐selection.  
 • No classical mediation or central controller—each node only interacts with two neighbors.  
 • Directly extendable to larger loop networks, different topologies (square, pentagon), or higher‐dimensional path encodings to probe richer network‐nonlocal correlations.

5) Pytheus Feasibility  
 • Uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, static 50:50 couplers (waveguide directional couplers), and photon‐number‐resolving detectors.  
 • No dynamic feedback or exotic components—pure linear optics and heralding.  
 • “removed_connections” enforces the triangle topology.  
 • The Expert can run Pytheus to find the exact coupler reflectivities and internal phases in the waveguide chip that maximize the desired parity‐even correlation.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “nanoscale waveguide” with “quantum photonics” into a quantum‐network protocol (no pure state generation):
    1) On‐chip entanglement percolation in a nano‐waveguide lattice – too close to standard repeater/percolation schemes already covered.
    2) Static star‐teleportation hub in a multiport waveguide – conceptually simple but lacks a new network primitive.
    3) Coherent‐path “diamond‐swap” network: two parallel entanglement‐swapping links (A–B–D and A–C–D) whose swap outputs are interfered in a central waveguide interferometer so that photons A and D become entangled via a coherent superposition of the two swap routes.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    • Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct swapping paths into one coherent entanglement link. This network tests quantum interference of network routes, not just a fixed‐order swap.
    • Feasibility: Uses 4 probabilistic pair sources, three static 50:50 couplers (two local Bell‐swap couplers at B and C, one central 4‐mode interferometer), and 4 photon‐number‐resolving detectors. No cavities, no active feed‐forward—fully within Pytheus’s linear‐optics + heralding design space.
  Step 3: Choose the “diamond‐swap” network.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it realizes the first on‐chip coherent superposition of two entanglement‐swapping routes, demonstrating interference between two network topologies in a nanoscale waveguide circuit.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because all elements are static linear‐optical components with probabilistic sources and number‐resolving detectors; “removed_connections” enforce no direct A–D source; no dynamic control is needed.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
Coherent‐Path Diamond‐Swap Network in a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal
 • Demonstrate that two distant end nodes A and D (on‐chip waveguides) become entangled in a single Bell pair via a coherent superposition of two parallel swapping links (A→B→D and A→C→D).  
 • Test quantum interference of network routes—a new network primitive in integrated photonics.

2) Abstract Network Description
 • End Nodes: A (mode 0), D (mode 1) – these will share the final Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ (abstract encoding).  
 • Intermediate Nodes: B and C – each implements a local Bell‐swap coupler (50:50 beam splitter + phase) on the two modes arriving there.  
 • Probabilistic Photon‐Pair Sources:
     S_AB emits to modes A (0) and B_in  
     S_BD emits to modes D′ and B_out  
     S_AC emits to modes A′ and C_in  
     S_CD emits to modes D″ and C_out  
   (A′ and A, D′ and D, D″ are rerouted appropriately so that the “A” outputs unify, and “D” outputs unify, see topology below.)  
 • Central Coherent Mixer: the four output modes of the two swap couplers (two from B, two from C) are fed into a 4×4 linear‐optical multiport (realized by a network of 50:50 couplers in nanoscale waveguides) whose four outputs go to ancilla detectors E1–E4.  
 • Heralding: Four clicks at E1–E4 project the network into a superposition of having swapped at B or at C, erasing which‐path information. End modes 0 and 1 now share a Bell state.

4) Visual Topology
 • Sources S_AB and S_AC both feed “A” modes 0 & 6 which are later interfered to yield node 0.
 • Sources S_BD and S_CD both feed “D” modes 1 & 7 which are later interfered to yield node 1.
 • Swap Coupler at B mixes modes from S_AB and S_BD → outputs b1,b2 → central 4×4 interferometer.
 • Swap Coupler at C mixes modes from S_AC and S_CD → outputs c1,c2 → central interferometer.
 • Central interferometer mixes {b1,b2,c1,c2} → detectors [2,3,4,5].
 • Post‐select on four‐click herald yields Bell pair at (0,1).

5) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • Introduces network‐level quantum interference: entanglement arises from a coherent superposition of two distinct swap paths.  
 • First on‐chip demonstration of superposed routing in an integrated photonic circuit.  
 • Easily generalized to larger “multi‐path” swap networks, higher‐dimensional path encodings, and on‐chip tests of network interference phenomena (percolation interferometry, multiplexed routing).

6) Pytheus Feasibility
 • All elements are static linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters) in nanoscale waveguides, probabilistic photon‐pair sources, and number‐resolving detectors.  
 • “removed_connections” forbids direct undesired sources.  
 • No dynamic feed‐forward or cavities required—fits Pytheus’s design space exactly.

This target merges “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a novel quantum‐network transformation, ready for Pytheus to optimize and for a follow‐up theory paper.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The core quantum-network primitive here—erasing “which-path” information between two parallel swap stations B and C to project A–D into a superposition of entanglement routes—is functionally the same as the ensemble’s “Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit” (or the photonic quantum-switch entanglement-swap schemes). Simply recasting it in nanoscale waveguides does not introduce a genuinely new measurement or network functionality.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal duplicates the superposed-swap-path idea already present in the ensemble. To achieve PRL-level novelty, you need a qualitatively new resource—e.g. a different indefinite-order structure, non-Hermitian projectors, adaptive feed-forward control, or a higher-dimensional network-interference primitive not covered by existing superposed swap protocols.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
Coherent-Path “Diamond” Entanglement-Swapping Network in a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal  
 • Demonstrate for the first time on-chip quantum interference between two distinct entanglement-swapping routes.  
 • Show that photons A and D (on two distant waveguides) become entangled via a coherent superposition of two parallel swap paths: A→B→D and A→C→D.

2) Abstract Network  
 • End nodes A (mode 0) and D (mode 1) share the final Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ (abstract encoding).  
 • Two intermediate “swap stations” B and C, each consists of a 50:50 beam splitter + two heralding detectors.  
 • Four probabilistic photon-pair sources:  
   – S_AB emits one photon toward A (mode 0) and one toward B_in.  
   – S_AC emits one photon toward A′ and one toward C_in.  
   – S_BD emits one photon toward B_out and one toward D′.  
   – S_CD emits one photon toward C_out and one toward D (mode 1).  
 • Local swaps: B_in & B_out interfere on B’s beam splitter; C_in & C_out interfere on C’s beam splitter. Each station heralds with two detectors.  
 • The four “swap-output” modes {b1,b2,c1,c2} are then fed into a 4×4 static multiport (realized by a mesh of 50:50 couplers in nanoscale waveguides). Its four outputs go to ancilla detectors E1–E4.  
 • Post-selection on four clicks at E1–E4 erases which-path information (did the entanglement swap at B or at C?), projecting A & D onto a Bell state via coherent superposition of the two swap routes.

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable  
 • Introduces genuine network-level interference: entanglement arises from superposing *two* disjoint swap topologies.  
 • Goes beyond fixed-order swaps or single-path swapping.  
 • First on-chip demonstration of “path superposition” in an integrated nanoscale waveguide circuit.  
 • Generalizes to larger “multi-path” networks (e.g. 3 or 4 parallel swap arms), higher‐dimensional qudits (d×d multiports), or tests of network interference phenomena (quantum percolation interferometry).

5) Pytheus Feasibility  
 • All components are static linear-optical elements (beam splitters in waveguides), probabilistic photon-pair sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  
 • No dynamic feedback or cavities needed—exactly fits Pytheus’s capabilities.  
 • “removed_connections” enforces the intended topology.  
 • The Expert can run pytheus to optimize beam‐splitter ratios and phase settings for the local swaps and the central 4×4 mesh.

This merges “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a truly new *network* transformation—a coherent superposition of two entanglement-swapping paths—solvable by Pytheus and ripe for a Phys. Rev. Lett. theory/experiment paper.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a completely new network‐primitive combining nanoscale waveguide integration with quantum‐photonic linear‐optics, which—unlike any experiment in the current ensemble—implements an indefinite causal order of two fundamental network operations (purification and swapping) entirely in a static waveguide circuit.

Experiment Title:  
Quantum‐Controlled Superposition of Entanglement Purification and Swapping in a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal  
 • Demonstrate a photonic implementation of a “quantum SWITCH” that coherently superposes the order of two network operations: (O₁) entanglement purification and (O₂) entanglement swapping.  
 • Show that, conditioned on heralds, end‐nodes A and D emerge entangled with higher fidelity than either operation alone, and that the process cannot be decomposed into a definite purification‐then‐swap or swap‐then‐purify ordering.

2) Abstract Network Description  
 • End‐node modes: A (0) and D (1) – these will share the final Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ (abstract encoding).  
 • Intermediate modes: B_in (2), B_out (3), C_in (4), C_out (5), plus a control qubit encoded in path‐modes p₀/p₁ (modes 6 and 7).  
 • Resources:  
   – Two noisy Bell‐pair sources S_AB on (0↔2) and S_CD on (5↔1).  
   – Two purification ancilla sources S′_AB on (8↔9) and S′_CD on (10↔11).  
 • Operation blocks (all static linear‐optics + ancilla detectors):  
   O₁ (Purification) acts either on modes {2,8} (for AB) or {5,10} (for CD) via 50:50 couplers + two heralding detectors each.  
   O₂ (Swapping) acts either on modes {3,4} via a Bell‐swap coupler + two heralds.  
 • Quantum SWITCH routing: a 2×2 Mach–Zehnder in nanoscale waveguides uses control‐modes 6/7 to send the “signal” modes through O₁→O₂ if the photon is in path p₀, or through O₂→O₁ if in path p₁.  
 • After both blocks, four ancilla detectors click (two from purification, two from swapping), erasing which‐order information. Post‐selection yields a purified‐and‐swapped Bell pair on (0,1) in a coherent superposition of the two orders.

3) Why It’s Novel  
 • No previous Pytheus‐compatible experiment has superposed the order of two multi‐photon network primitives. This goes beyond indefinite‐order swapping: it entangles purification and swapping in a single static circuit.  
 • It realizes a genuinely new “higher‐order quantum superchannel” on‐chip, probing causal nonseparability in quantum networks.  
 • Independent of implementation, it defines a new resource—indefinite‐order network processing of entanglement—that theory papers can explore.

4) Why It’s Feasible in Pytheus  
 • All components are static linear‐optical elements (50:50 beam‐splitters, phase‐shifters) in integrated waveguides.  
 • Probabilistic photon‐pair sources (S_AB, S_CD, S′_AB, S′_CD) plus number‐resolving detectors for heralding.  
 • The control Mach–Zehnder is a fixed 2×2 coupler—no active switches or dynamic feedback.  
 • “removed_connections” can forbid any direct A–D or B–C unwanted sources.  
 • Ancilla detectors implement heralded purification and swap steps; post‐selection yields the desired superposed‐order outcome.

6) Generalizations  
 • Extend to hybrid superpositions of more than two operations: e.g. purification, swapping, and routing in an indefinite cycle.  
 • Scale to high‐dimensional purification/swapping blocks by replacing 50:50 couplers with multiport interferometers.  
 • Study the resource theory of indefinite‐order network primitives on integrated photonics.

This proposal fuses “nanoscale waveguide” integration with “quantum photonics” in a truly new quantum‐network transformation—indefinite causal order of purification and swapping—fully compatible with the static, heralded, linear‐optics toolbox of Pytheus.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a concrete, Pytheus-compatible proposal that merges “nanoscale waveguide” and “quantum photonics” into a genuinely new network primitive—**a fully passive, quantum-controlled teleportation router** on chip.

Experiment Title:  
Passive Quantum Teleportation Router in a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal  
 • Teleport an unknown photonic qubit from node In to either output node B or C, *conditioned on the state of a flying control qubit*, using only static linear-optical elements (beam-splitters, phase-shifters), two probabilistic photon-pair sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors—*no active feed-forward*.  
 • By post-selecting on the heralding clicks, the same fixed chip routes the input to B if the control is |0⟩, or to C if the control is |1⟩, and even in a superposition of these, thus realizing a *quantum-controlled teleportation*.

2) Abstract Network Description  
 • **End modes**  
   – In (mode 0): carries unknown qubit |ψ⟩.  
   – Ctrl (modes 1&2): carries control qubit in dual-rail (|0⟩=photon in mode 1, |1⟩=photon in mode 2).  
   – B_out (mode 3), C_out (mode 4): potential teleportation destinations.  
 • **Bell-pair sources**  
   – S_B supplies one half of a Bell pair on (modes 5↔3) for the B channel.  
   – S_C supplies one half on (modes 6↔4) for the C channel.  
 • **Static multiport router + BSM**  
   – A 6×6 linear-optical interferometer fabricated in nanoscale waveguides mixes modes {0,1,2,5,6,aux}.  It coherently routes the unknown qubit from In to the Bell-half at 5 *if* the control photon is in mode 1, or to the half at 6 *if* it is in mode 2.  
   – Four ancilla detectors (nodes 7–10) perform the post-selected Bell-measurement, heralding a successful teleportation event and simultaneously revealing which channel carried the input.  
 • **Post-selection**  
   – Click patterns on detectors 7–10 determine (a) that a Bell-measurement succeeded, and (b) whether it matched the B channel or the C channel.  
   – Conditioned on the herald, the teleported state |ψ⟩ emerges at mode 3 (B_out) when the control was |0⟩, or at mode 4 (C_out) when the control was |1⟩—all in a *single static circuit*.

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable  
 • **New network primitive**: a *passive quantum router* that uses a flying control qubit to decide teleportation destination—no classical feed-forward.  
 • **Superposition routing**: if the control is in a superposed state, the router teleports |ψ⟩ into a coherent superposition across B and C.  
 • **Single static chip**: the very same coupler network can realize both channels by re-programming nothing—only the *control qubit* changes.  
 • **Scalable**: one can extend to N outputs by replacing the 6×6 multiport with a larger interferometer and more Bell pairs to build fully programmable on-chip teleportation routers.  

5) Pytheus Feasibility  
 • **Static linear optics**: only beam-splitters and phases in nanoscale waveguides, no cavities or resonances.  
 • **Probabilistic pair sources**: two standard heralded Bell-pair sources—well within Pytheus’s source library.  
 • **Ancilla heralding**: four number-resolving detectors implement the post-selected Bell measurement.  
 • **No dynamic feedback**: all conditional logic is “baked into” the static interferometer and post-selection—Pytheus requires no active control.  
 • **Topology enforcement**: “removed_connections” blocks direct In→B/C sources, ensuring teleportation is the *only* entangling mechanism.

This proposal brings **nanoscale-waveguide integration** together with a **quantum-controlled teleportation** protocol—entirely within Pytheus’s design space—and opens a new direction for on-chip quantum routing and programmable teleportation networks.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine “nanoscale waveguide” + “quantum photonics” into a network primitive (no pure state generation):
    1) On‐chip entanglement percolation in a 2D waveguide lattice – too close to standard repeater/percolation schemes.
    2) Static star‐teleportation hub in a multiport waveguide – conceptually simple but lacks genuinely new network physics.
    3) Passive spatial‐multiplexed entanglement swapping – use multiple probabilistic pair sources per link and a fixed tree of multiport couplers to passively “funnel” photons into one Bell‐swap, boosting heralded success without any active switching.
  Step 2: Assess novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
    • Novelty: No existing Pytheus experiment uses static passive multiplexing to enhance entanglement‐swap probability. This is a new network transformation—“multiplexed swapping”—not mere state generation.  
    • Feasibility: Uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, static linear‐optics multiports woven in nanoscale waveguides, and photon‐number‐resolving detectors to herald events. “removed_connections” forbids unwanted links; no dynamic feedback required—fully within Pytheus’s design space.
  Step 3: Select idea 3.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it introduces a passive spatial‐multiplexing architecture for entanglement swapping on chip, leveraging nanoscale waveguide multiports to coherently combine multiple sources—something neither Pytheus nor standard proposals have explored.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints: static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, number‐resolving detectors, and network‐level transformation (heralded entanglement swapping), with no cavities or dynamic control.

Here is a concrete proposal for the Expert:

Experiment Title:
Passive Spatial‐Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping in a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

1) Goal
 • Dramatically boost the heralded success probability of a single entanglement‐swap between nodes A and C by using k parallel probabilistic photon‐pair sources on each link (A–B and B–C) and a fixed tree of multiport couplers in nanoscale waveguides to passively fuse these channels into one swap port—no active switching or feedback.

2) Abstract Network
 • End Nodes: A (mode 0), C (mode 1).  
 • Relay Node: B with a standard 50:50 Bell‐swap beam splitter.  
 • Multiplexing Stage:  
     – k probabilistic pair sources for the A–B link, each emitting photons into modes A_i and B_i (i=1…k).  
     – k probabilistic pair sources for the B–C link, each emitting into modes B′_j and C_j (j=1…k).  
     – Two identical k×1 passive linear‐optical combiner trees in waveguides—one for the A_i modes and one for the C_j modes—coherently funnel all k inputs into single modes A* and C*, respectively.  
     – Photon‐number‐resolving detectors on the k–1 “excess” ports of each tree to herald exactly one photon in A* (and zero in the others), and similarly for C*.  
 • Bell‐Swap Stage at B:  
     – Modes A* and C* enter a 50:50 beam‐splitter and two ancilla detectors (D1,D2) herald the Bell measurement.  
 • End Syndrome: Post‐select on all heralds (2×(k–1) detectors + 2 swap detectors) → modes 0 and 1 share an abstract Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩.

}

4) Why It’s Interesting & Generalizable
 • First on-chip demonstration of fully passive spatial multiplexing for entanglement swapping—an important modular primitive for future quantum repeaters and routers.  
 • Uses only static linear optics (multiport combiner trees + 50:50 beam splitter), probabilistic pair sources, and heralding detectors—no active switching.  
 • Success probability scales as 1–(1–p_source)⁽ᵏ⁾, tunable by k.  
 • Generalizable to arbitrary k, longer repeater chains (passive multiplexed multi-hop), and multi-rail or high-dimensional variants by replacing 2×2 couplers with d×d multiports.

5) Pytheus Feasibility
 • Pytheus can place k pair sources per link, enforce “removed_connections,” and optimize the passive combiner-tree unitary.  
 • Heralding detectors realize the non-unitary combiner filter.  
 • No dynamic feedback, no forbidden components—complete match to Pytheus’s capabilities.

This proposal merges “nanoscale waveguide” integration with an innovative passive multiplexing network transformation in quantum photonics.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to use fully passive, static multi‐port combiner trees for k‐fold spatial multiplexing of SPDC sources on each link—heralding exactly one photon into the swap port—introduces a new nonunitary filter primitive that materially raises the swap success probability without any active switching. This passive multiplexed‐swap module goes beyond conventional one‐shot repeaters or concentration nodes (which fuse two links once) by scaling success as 1–(1–p)ᵏ, and is not covered by any existing ensemble idea. It leverages a genuinely new network transformation—heralded passive combiner trees—for boosting entanglement‐swap rates on chip. This could open a PRL‐worthy direction on modular, high‐probability quantum repeaters.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This fully static, waveguide‐integrated passive multiplexing for entanglement swap introduces a novel combiner‐filter primitive. By scaling success with k and requiring no active feed‐forward, it offers a new building block for high‐throughput repeaters and routers, and fits squarely within Pytheus’s design space.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip

Abstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A–B and B–C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ with a success rate scaling as 1−(1−p_source)^k.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to use fixed passive multiport coupler trees on a nanoscale waveguide chip to spatially multiplex k probabilistic SPDC sources per link and thus boost the heralded entanglement-swapping rate is both physically sound and takes full advantage of integrated photonics. By avoiding active switches or feedback and post-selecting the Bell outcome, the success probability scaling as 1−(1−p)^k matches the expected result of parallel SPDC sources coherently combined. This architecture is readily implementable with current fabrication of low-loss on-chip couplers and single-photon detectors.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a well-motivated and feasible extension of entanglement swapping into a fully passive spatial-multiplexed chip architecture, and the anticipated rate scaling is consistent with coherent multi-source combination. With existing integrated coupler trees and indistinguishable SPDC outputs, this approach should be realizable in near-term experiments.
