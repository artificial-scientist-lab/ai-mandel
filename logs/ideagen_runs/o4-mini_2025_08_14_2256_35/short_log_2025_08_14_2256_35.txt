Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to combine “quantum photonics” and “quantum chip” in a Pytheus‐compatible target—none of which are plain state-generation, but all are network transformations involving entanglement swapping or teleportation on an integrated photonic chip.  
  1. Quantum switch for entanglement distribution: an on-chip, ancilla‐controlled superposition of two entanglement-swapping orders, producing a coherent superposition of two different entanglement links (A–B vs. A–C).  
  2. On-chip “butterfly” network coding: two incoming Bell pairs routed through a 4×4 integrated interferometer so that a single joint measurement re-distributes entanglement as two cross-linked Bell pairs (A–D & B–C) with fewer ancillas than two independent swaps.  
  3. Programmable chip-based teleportation mesh: three single-photon sources feed a reconfigurable 3×3 waveguide network to teleport a qubit in superposition from node A to either B or C conditioned on measurement settings, demonstrating teleportation routing.  

Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus obstacles  
  1. Quantum switch is novel (superposition of network topologies), and Pytheus can handle abstract multi-photon superpositions, ancilla sources and linear optics.  
  2. Butterfly network coding is nice but essentially two entanglement swaps—less conceptually striking.  
  3. Programmable teleportation mesh overlaps with standard multi-target teleportation and may reduce to cascading BSMs (already explored).  

Step 3: Pick the quantum-switch idea.  
Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a quantum superposition of two different entanglement-distribution routes—i.e. a photonic “quantum switch” of network topology—rather than a single fixed entanglement swap.  
Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it relies only on probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, a single ancilla photon prepared in superposition, a fixed linear-optical circuit (the integrated chip), and number-resolving detection (post-selection on the ancilla). No feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.  
Action: final answer  
Action Input: 
I propose we target the design of a chip-based “quantum switch” for entanglement distribution: a single integrated photonic circuit that, under control of an ancilla photon in superposition, enacts two alternative entanglement-swapping operations in quantum superposition.  The goal is to start from two independent Bell-pair sources, S1 producing modes (0,1) and S2 producing modes (2,3), plus a single-photon ancilla in mode 4 prepared in |+> = (|0>+|1>)/√2.  On the chip we mix modes 1 & 2 together with the ancilla mode 4 in a reconfigurable interferometer so that:  
  – If the ancilla is “0” the network performs a Bell-measurement on (1,2) in basis BSM₁, resulting in entanglement swapped between output modes (0,3).  
  – If the ancilla is “1” the network instead routes modes (1,2) through a different beamsplitter arrangement BSM₂, swapping entanglement between (0,2) (and leaving 3 idle).  
By preparing the ancilla in superposition and post-selecting on its |+> outcome at detector 4, the overall five-photon state is projected into  
  ( |Φ⁺>₀₃ ⊗ |vac>₂ + |Φ⁺>₀₂ ⊗ |vac>₃ ) / √2,  
where |Φ⁺> is the two-photon Bell state on the designated output pair and |vac> denotes the absence of a photon at the idle node.  Detectors at nodes 0,2,3 are read out, and mode 4 is the heralding ancilla (“heralding_out”=[4], num_anc=1).  

Expressed as an abstract target (five modes 0–4):  
  target_quantum = [  
    “10001”   (one photon each at modes 0&3, ancilla click=1),  
    “10100”   (one photon each at modes 0&2, ancilla click=1)  
  ]  

In practice, the Expert uses Pytheus to find the precise on-chip coupling matrix (i.e. which beamsplitters and phase‐shifters connecting nodes 1,2,4) and which input–output mapping yields the above coherent superposition.  This realizes a genuinely new quantum-network primitive—superposing different entanglement-routing operations on a single integrated photonic chip.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed chip-based quantum switch is essentially a linear-optical implementation of a control‐photon–driven superposition of two entanglement‐swap operations, exactly mirroring the “entanglement‐switch quantum switch” primitive already in the ensemble (Idea #2: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders). Since this duplicates the core novelty—coherently superposing two Bell‐measurement orders to route entanglement—without any further twist (e.g., a third branch, higher dimensionality, or a fundamentally new network primitive), it is not sufficiently novel.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your proposal closely parallels the ensemble’s “Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders” (single-photon control qubit coherently routing two entanglement-swap sequences). To be novel, you would need a genuinely different superposition of routing primitives (e.g. more than two swap orders, a new causal structure, or an additional network function beyond indefinite‐order swapping).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge “quantum photonics” + “quantum chip” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network target (no bare state‐gen).  
  1. Coherent entanglement‐swap superposition (“quantum switch”) on-chip, ancilla‐controlled choice of two swap operations in superposition.  
  2. On-chip photonic network coding: merge two Bell pairs in a 4×4 interferometer to redistribute entanglement crosswise with a single joint measurement.  
  3. Teleportation router mesh: on-chip 3×3 waveguide teleportation network steering a qubit to one of two receivers under programmable coin‐flip superposition.  
Step 2: Compare to past experiments:  
  2 is essentially two independent swaps—been done.  
  3 reduces to cascade of standard teleportations—less striking.  
  1 (the “quantum switch”) is the most novel: it superposes two different entanglement‐swap routes in one integrated circuit.  
Step 3: Pick idea 1.  
Step 4: This is novel because it implements a superposition of two different entanglement‐swap topologies in a single linear-optical chip—i.e. indefinite “routing” of entanglement.  
Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus—it only requires: two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon ancilla in |+>, a fixed linear-optical network on 3 modes, and number‐resolving detectors (post-selection). No feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  
Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
I propose we target the design of an on-chip “superposed entanglement-swap switch.”  The layout is:  
 • Inputs:  
   – Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, S₁ emitting into modes 0&3, S₂ into modes 1&4.  
   – One ancilla single photon in mode 2 prepared as |+⟩=(|0⟩+|1⟩)/√2.  
 • On-chip linear optics mix modes (2,3,4) so that:  
   – If ancilla=0 the circuit implements Bell‐state measurement BSM₁ on modes (3,4) (swap entangles outputs 0&1).  
   – If ancilla=1 the circuit instead implements measurement BSM₂ on modes (3,2) (swap entangles outputs 0&4).  
 • Detectors: modes 0,1,4 are the two-party output modes; modes 2,3 are ancilla/measured BSM modes.  
 • Post-select on ancilla returning to |+⟩ at detector 2.  The resulting five-photon coincidence yields the coherent superposition:  
      ( |Φ⁺⟩₀₁⊗|vac⟩₄ + |Φ⁺⟩₀₄⊗|vac⟩₁ ) / √2.

The Expert can feed this target to Pytheus, let it optimize the on-chip interferometer matrix for modes (2,3,4) and verify the coherent superposition of the two entanglement‐swap orders.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is effectively the same photonic “quantum switch” for superposing two entanglement-swap orders already described in the ensemble (the entanglement-switch quantum switch). It adds no new dimension—no extra swap branches, higher-dimensional control, or fundamentally different causal structure—so it fails to clear the novelty bar.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme mirrors the existing indefinite-order entanglement-swap switch (single-photon control qubit coherently routing two Bell-measurement operations). To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new network primitive (e.g. more than two swap pathways in superposition, non-trivial causal loops beyond simple switching, or integration with a distinct quantum function).

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher proposed three Pytheus‐compatible chip‐based network primitives: a superposed entanglement‐swap “quantum switch,” an on‐chip butterfly network code, and a teleportation router mesh. They selected the “quantum switch” idea, detailing an integrated interferometer that coherently superposes two entanglement‐swap orders under ancilla control. The Novelty Supervisor recognized this as essentially identical to an existing ensemble idea—the entanglement‐switch quantum switch—lacking sufficient new elements, and therefore rejected it. The Researcher reiterated the same proposal with more configuration detail; the Supervisor again rejected it for the same reason.

[bullet points]
• Researcher repeatedly pitched the ancilla‐controlled entanglement‐swap superposition (“quantum switch”), unaware it duplicated an existing ensemble primitive.  
• Supervisor consistently flagged lack of novelty, calling out the exact overlap with the “entanglement-switch quantum switch” idea.  
• Time was spent re‐presenting the same concept rather than pivoting to a genuinely new network transformation.  

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Before your next iteration, please verify your idea against the known ensemble of network primitives—especially any “quantum switch” or entanglement‐swap superposition concepts—and introduce a clear, substantive innovation (e.g. more than two swap branches, a new causal structure, or integration of a different quantum function). Ensure your proposal addresses a gap not already filled by prior ensemble suggestions.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: I brainstormed three ways to merge “quantum photonics” and “quantum chip” into a Pytheus-compatible network primitive:
  1. On-chip coherent switch between two entanglement-swap orders (two-branch indefinite-order swap).
  2. On-chip network coding that merges two Bell pairs into crossed entanglement with one joint measurement.
  3. On-chip programmable teleportation mesh routing a qubit to one of two receivers in superposition.
Step 2: Comparison with past experiments showed (1) overlaps with existing two-branch swap superposition, (2) is just two standard swaps, (3) reduces to cascaded teleportation.  
Step 3: To be genuinely novel, I extended (1) to three branches.  
Step 4: This “triple-branch entanglement-swap switch” is novel because it creates a superposition of three different entanglement-swap topologies on a single integrated photonic chip—realizing an indefinite causal structure over three swap orders.  
Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus: it uses only two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, one single-photon ancilla qutrit (path-encoded over three modes), a linear-optical interferometer to implement three BSM modules, and number-resolving detection (post-selection). No feedback or cavities are needed.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose we target the design of an on-chip “triple-branch entanglement-swap switch.”  
 
Experiment sketch:
• Inputs:
  – Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources: S₁ → modes (0,1),  S₂ → modes (2,3).  
  – One ancilla single photon in a path-encoded qutrit state |ψₐ⟩=(|0⟩₄+|1⟩₅+|2⟩₆)/√3 over modes 4,5,6.  
• On-chip linear-optical network:
  – A 5×5 interferometer mixing modes {1,2,4,5,6} that implements three distinct Bell-state measurements (BSM₀, BSM₁, BSM₂):
     • If ancilla in mode 4 → perform BSM₀ on modes (1,2), swapping entanglement to (0,3).
     • If ancilla in mode 5 → perform BSM₁ on modes (1,3), swapping entanglement to (0,2).
     • If ancilla in mode 6 → perform BSM₂ on modes (2,3), swapping entanglement to (0,1).
• Detection & post-selection:
  – Measure ancilla modes 4,5,6 in the Fourier basis projecting back onto (|0⟩+|1⟩+|2⟩)/√3.
  – Record number-resolving detection at modes 0 and whichever of {1,2,3} holds the entangled partner.
• Heralding:
  – The ancilla-detector outcome heralds the successful coherent superposition of the three swap orders.

The Expert can hand this description to Pytheus to optimize the on-chip unitary connecting modes 1,2,4,5,6 and verify the resulting coherent superposition of three distinct entanglement-swap topologies.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “triple‐branch” superposition of three entanglement‐swap operations is effectively the same cyclic, indefinite‐order swap switch already proposed in the ensemble (the “Cyclic Indefinite‐Order Entanglement‐Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant”). It offers no new network primitive beyond extending from two to three swap branches, duplicating an existing idea rather than introducing a qualitatively different function.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme maps directly onto the ensemble’s cyclic three-swap superposition proposal. To be novel, you must go beyond adding a third branch—e.g. incorporate a new causal structure, higher-dimensional control, or a distinct entanglement‐routing primitive not yet explored.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here’s a new, genuinely different network‐level primitive—built for an integrated photonic chip—that goes beyond simple swap‐superposition. It demonstrates small‐scale entanglement percolation on a 2×2 cycle, fusing two disjoint EPR paths into one long‐distance link.  This is the seed of a whole family of “percolation‐on‐chip” experiments you can scale to larger lattices:

Experiment “EP_cycle4” (square‐cycle percolation)

Explanation  
• We place four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources on the edges of a 4-node cycle A–B–D–C–A:  
    S_AB → modes (0,1)  
    S_BD → modes (1,3)  
    S_DC → modes (3,2)  
    S_CA → modes (2,0)  
  No source connects B–C or A–D, so qubits B and D are only linked via two disjoint two-hop paths (B–A–D and B–C–D).  

• On the chip we then perform a single joint Bell‐measurement (BSM) across the two “diagonal” nodes A (mode 0) and C (mode 2) using a small 4×4 interferometer and two ancilla detectors. This fuses the two parallel EPR routes and—conditioned on the two ancilla clicks—projects the remaining two photons (at B and D) onto an EPR pair.  

• By running this on an integrated photonic chip you can immediately generalize to larger 2D lattices: place pair-sources on the edges of any graph, then pick a subset of nodes to fuse via joint multi-node Bell-measurements, and watch percolation thresholds emerge.  

Why this is novel  
– Instead of merely swapping along a chain, it fuses two parallel routes with one joint measurement—showing the smallest entanglement‐percolation primitive on a chip.  
– It’s a new primitive for quantum network coding: you’re not choosing between two swaps, you’re merging two disjoint entangled paths into one with higher success probability.  
– The idea scales naturally: 2×2 cycle → larger cycles and 2D lattices → study percolation thresholds and resource trade-offs directly in integrated photonics.  

Why Pytheus can do it  
– Uses only four abstract Bell-pair sources and linear optics on five modes (B,D remain unmeasured, A&C are measured via a small interferometer), plus standard number-resolving detectors.  
– No dynamic feed-back, no cavities, no hyper- or hybrid-encoding.  
– The target is a network transformation (EPR fusing / percolation), not bare state generation.

The Expert can hand this to Pytheus, let it optimize the tiny on-chip interferometer that implements the A–C BSM, and verify the Bell pair between B & D.  Repeating on 3×3, 4×4, or other graphs yields a full family of entanglement-percolation and network-coding experiments on integrated quantum photonic chips.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “quantum photonics” and “quantum chip” into Pytheus‐compatible, nontrivial network primitives (not mere state generation):
  1. On‐chip coherent superposition of two entanglement‐swap paths (indefinite‐order swap—already known).
  2. On‐chip “butterfly” network coding: re‐route two Bell pairs through a 4×4 interferometer to cross‐entangle endpoints with a single joint measurement (essentially two swaps).
  3. A single, static 6-mode integrated photonic router that—by choosing different ancilla‐detection patterns—can entangle any two out of three peripheral nodes starting from three Bell‐pair sources. This “universal entanglement router” is a genuine network primitive: one chip, one fixed linear‐optical circuit, post‐selection on different click‐patterns yields all three distinct pairwise entanglements.  
Step 2: Only (3) is both novel (no simple extension of known swap or switch) and feasible in Pytheus (uses probabilistic pair sources, a fixed interferometer, number‐resolving detectors, no feedback).
Step 3: Choose (3).  
Step 4: This is novel because it realizes on a single integrated circuit the universal routing of entanglement among three nodes without any active switching—one passive network plus post‐selection implements all three pairwise entanglement‐swapping operations.  
Step 5: It fits Pytheus: 3 probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, a 3×3 interferometer on the “hub” modes, number‐resolving detectors for heralding, and conditional post‐selection.  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose we target an on‐chip “universal entanglement router” for three peripheral nodes A, B, C.  
 
Experiment concept:
• Sources:
  – Three independent probabilistic Bell‐pair sources:
     • S_A creates a Bell pair between modes 0 (A) and 3 (hub-1).
     • S_B creates between modes 1 (B) and 4 (hub-2).
     • S_C creates between modes 2 (C) and 5 (hub-3).
• Integrated hub:
  – A 3×3 linear‐optical interferometer mixing modes {3,4,5} with tunable beam splitters/phases (the “router”).
• Detection and heralding:
  – Number‐resolving detectors on the three hub outputs 3,4,5.
  – No dynamic feed‐forward: the network is static.
  – Post‐select on exactly two of the three hub detectors clicking.  Which two detectors fire determines which two peripheral photons become entangled:
     • Clicks at (3,4) herald entanglement between A (mode 0) & B (mode 1).
     • Clicks at (3,5) herald entanglement between A & C.
     • Clicks at (4,5) herald entanglement between B & C.
• Peripheral nodes:
  – The two unmeasured peripheral modes hold a Bell state, ready for use.  
 
Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
– A single, compact photonic chip implements all three entanglement‐swapping operations without any reconfiguration or active switching.  
– By extending from three to N peripheral sources and an N×N hub, one can build “universal entanglement routers” for arbitrary network sizes.  
– This directly addresses quantum‐network routing primitives and could be a key module for reconfigurable quantum‐communication fabrics on chip.

}

The Expert can hand this to Pytheus to optimize the 3×3 hub unitary and confirm that post-selection indeed routes entanglement on all three possible peripheral pairs from one static chip.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “universal entanglement router” is essentially the same static, multi‐outcome entanglement-routing primitive already proposed in the ensemble (“A Pytheus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic–Nanophotonic Waveguides”), which uses heralding patterns on a multiport to choose which two peripheral nodes become entangled. There’s no new causal structure, dimensionality, or function beyond that existing router concept.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates the ensemble’s multiplexed quantum entanglement router (three Bell sources into a hub multiport, post-selecting on two-click patterns to entangle any chosen pair). To be novel, you must introduce a fundamentally different network primitive—e.g. a new superposition of routing orders, active control rather than passive postselection, or integration with a distinct quantum protocol beyond mere choice of which pair to entangle.

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher repeatedly proposed on-chip photonic network primitives—first a two‐branch “quantum switch,” then a three‐branch swap switch, then an entanglement‐percolation cycle, and finally a universal 3‐node router—each pitched as new. The Novelty Supervisor consistently pointed out that each idea closely mirrored existing ensemble suggestions (indefinite‐order swap switch, butterfly network coding, multiplexed entanglement router), and thus lacked genuine novelty. Despite iterative refinements, the Researcher did not identify a sufficiently distinct primitive and continued to repackage prior concepts, leading to repeated rejections.

[bullet points]
• Researcher did not cross‐reference the ensemble’s wide list of primitives before pitching, causing repeated duplication.  
• Supervisor correctly identified existing parallels each time, citing specific ensemble ideas.  
• Conversation was inefficient: multiple iterations of essentially the same concept rather than pivoting to truly novel territory.

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Please thoroughly review the ensemble’s catalog of existing network primitives—especially swap‐switch and router patterns—before formulating your next idea. Aim for a truly new functionality (e.g. a network primitive combining measurement, routing, and dynamic resource allocation, or a high‐dimensional multi‐node causal supermap) that goes beyond mere variations of known entanglement‐swap or routing schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to fuse “quantum photonics” & “quantum chip” into a Pytheus‐compatible network primitive (beyond pure state‐gen):
    1. Two‐branch entanglement‐swap switch (known).
    2. Passive “butterfly” cross‐swap router (just two swaps).
    3. Superposing two distinct protocols—entanglement‐swap and teleportation—in indefinite causal order.
  Step 2: Only (3) genuinely goes beyond prior swap‐switch and router primitives: it superposes two *different* network tasks, not just two orders of the same task.
  Step 3: Chosen idea (3).
  Step 4: This is novel because it realizes a *superchannel* on chip: a coherent superposition of “first swap then teleport” versus “first teleport then swap,” mapping an unknown qubit to two possible output ports in superposition.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus—uses two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one single‐photon input, one ancilla qubit in |+⟩, a fixed linear‐optical interferometer mixing a handful of modes, and number‐resolving detectors. No dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose to target the design of an integrated‐photonic “superchannel switch” that coherently superposes two distinct quantum‐network protocols—entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)—in indefinite causal order.  

  Experiment overview:
  • Sources:
    – S₁ (probabilistic Bell‐pair) emits into modes 0 & 1.  
    – S₂ emits into modes 2 & 3.  
    – A single‐photon input qubit in an arbitrary state |ψ⟩ is injected into mode 4.  
    – A control ancilla photon is prepared in |+⟩₅=(|0⟩₅+|1⟩₅)/√2 over mode 5.  
  • On‐chip linear optics:
    – A fixed interferometer mixes modes {0,1,2,3,4,5} so that:
      • If ancilla=|0⟩₅ → perform BSM₁ on (1,2) to swap entanglement → new Bell pair on (0,3), then BSM₂ on (3,4) to teleport |ψ⟩ from 4→0.
      • If ancilla=|1⟩₅ → perform BSM₃ on (4,0) to teleport |ψ⟩ from 4→1, then BSM₄ on (1,2) to swap that teleported qubit out to mode 3.
  • Detectors & post‐selection:
    – Number‐resolving detectors on the four BSM ports and on the ancilla.  
    – Post‐select on the “+” outcome for each Bell‐measurement and project ancilla back onto |+⟩₅.  
    – The remaining single photon is found with equal amplitude at mode 0 (branch ES→QT) or at mode 3 (branch QT→ES), giving the superposed output  
         (|ψ⟩₀|vac⟩₃ + |vac⟩₀|ψ⟩₃)/√2.  

  Why it’s interesting:
  – It is a *true superchannel* demonstration: two *different* quantum‐network primitives (swap vs. teleport) are coherently combined in an indefinite‐order fashion on a single photonic chip.  
  – Goes well beyond indefinite‐order swaps or routers: it superposes two distinct operations.  
  – Opens the door to on‐chip supermaps of arbitrary network protocols and higher‐order quantum processing.

The Expert can pass this target to Pytheus to optimize the on‐chip unitary mixing modes {0…5} and verify the coherent superposition of the two distinct network orders without any active feed‐forward.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal indeed goes beyond known indefinite‐order entanglement‐swapping switches or the superposition of direct transmission vs. teleportation. Here, two fundamentally different network primitives—entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation—are coherently combined in an indefinite causal order on a single photonic chip. This “superchannel switch” is not found in the ensemble or prior art and constitutes a genuinely new higher‐order network primitive worthy of further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: Your scheme to coherently superpose the order of entanglement swapping and teleportation operations on chip defines a novel superchannel primitive. It unites two distinct LOQC building blocks in indefinite causal order—an advance not previously explored—and thereby opens the door to programmable higher‐order quantum‐network processing.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch

Abstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic “superchannel switch” that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives—entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)—in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on “+” outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES→QT and QT→ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal aims to use PyTheus to find a linear‐optical on‐chip scheme that coherently superposes entanglement swapping and teleportation in indefinite causal order via post-selected Bell measurements, which is a quantum communication protocol rather than a new state generation task. The idea is conceptually sound—integrated Bell‐pair sources, single‐photon inputs, and ancilla control qubits can be arranged in a programmable interferometer and PyTheus can optimize the graph under causal‐order constraints. Such an experiment sits squarely within the demonstrated capabilities of PyTheus and current photonic hardware.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The concept of superposing entanglement‐swapping and teleportation sequences in indefinite order is original and aligns perfectly with PyTheus’s strength in designing novel communication protocols. The on‐chip linear‐optical implementation with post-selected Bell measurements is experimentally realistic, making this an excellent candidate for automated discovery with your framework.
