    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Two-state transfer: a generalization of pair and plus state transfer\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Development of a Boston-area 50-km fiber quantum network testbed\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: What exactly does Bekenstein bound?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas. THE FEEDBACK IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT !!! FOR SURE LOOK AT THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE CORE IDEA OF THEM!! YOU HAVE FAILED SO OFTEN BEFORE, FREAKING TAKE IT SERIOUS!\n\nSTART OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n<existing_feedback>\nEND OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n\nThis feedback is extremely important and very valuable information. It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 different ways to connect \u201cnonclassical light\u201d and \u201cquantum protocol\u201d in a Pytheus\u2010compatible target, focusing on network tasks (swapping, teleportation, routing), avoiding state\u2010generation targets:\n\n  1. Quantum network coding (butterfly network teleportation): Two senders each hold a qubit in a single\u2010photon Fock basis; they share Bell\u2010pair links to a central node forming the classical \u201cbutterfly\u201d graph. At that central bottleneck, two simultaneous Bell\u2010measurements (linear optics + ancilla photons) implement a network\u2010coded teleportation so that each sender\u2019s qubit arrives at the opposing receiver post\u2010selected.  \n     \u2010 Novelty check: I don't see any Pytheus examples or literature implementing network\u2010coded teleportation with linear optics; existing examples are plain entanglement\u2010swapping or multi\u2010pair swapping.  \n     \u2010 Obstacles: specifying a teleportation of unknown qubits is conceptually a unitary transform on arbitrary states, but Pytheus only handles fixed target states. We can sidestep by choosing the four computational basis inputs (|00>,|01>,|10>,|11>) and demand that the joint source\u2010+\u2010network produces the four corresponding swapped outputs post\u2010selected.  \n\n  2. Remote SWAP\u2010gate via entanglement\u2010swapping: Two qubits held by Alice and Bob are post\u2010selected to be swapped\u2014Alice ends up with Bob's input and vice versa\u2014using only entangled pair\u2010sources and Bell\u2010measurements at an intermediate node.  \n     \u2010 Novelty check: Pytheus has heralded CNOT/Toffoli, but I see no SWAP\u2010gate implemented as a network protocol.  \n     \u2010 Obstacles: same as above\u2014mapping arbitrary inputs\u2014but again we can fix the computational\u2010basis mapping.  \n\n  3. Multi\u2010party conference key (secret\u2010sharing) via chained entanglement swapping: A star network of three parties A,B,C who share pairwise Bell\u2010sources to a central \u201cCharlie\u201d node. Charlie\u2019s joint measurement projects A,B,C onto a GHZ\u2010like correlation, and classical post\u2010selection yields a secret\u2010sharing protocol.  \n     \u2010 Novelty check: GHZ creation is state generation, which is forbidden.  \n\nStep 2: The network\u2010coding teleportation (option 1) appears most novel, because:\n\n  \u2022 It is not just entanglement swapping or teleportation of one qubit\u2014 but two qubits simultaneously crossing a network bottleneck in the butterfly topology, demonstrating true quantum network coding.\n  \u2022 It combines nonclassical light (single\u2010photon qubits + Bell\u2010pair sources) with a bona fide quantum protocol (network\u2010coded teleportation).\n  \u2022 It generalizes immediately to larger network graphs and higher dimensions (qutrit coding), yielding a family of experiments.\n\nStep 3: Assert novelty & feasibility:\n  \u2022 This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment has attempted simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a shared bottleneck (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) purely with passive linear optics and pair\u2010sources. It extends entanglement swapping into the network\u2010coding domain.\n  \u2022 This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework: we can model the two unknown qubits as four single\u2010photon emitters, Bell\u2010pair sources on the four network edges, a linear\u2010optical circuit at the central node performing two joint Bell\u2010state measurements (no feedback), and post\u2010selection on the correct two\u2010photon click patterns. The target can be specified by listing the four computational\u2010basis inputs at the senders and demanding the corresponding basis outputs at the receivers.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nWe propose a photonic\u2010linear\u2010optics implementation of quantum network coding in the \u201cbutterfly\u201d topology, demonstrating simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a shared bottleneck node. This combines nonclassical light (single\u2010photon Fock\u2010state qubits and Bell\u2010pair sources) with a genuine quantum protocol (network\u2010coded teleportation).  \n\nDescription of the target network:\n\nParties & Modes:\n\u2010 Senders S\u2081 and S\u2082 each have one unknown qubit encoded in a single\u2010photon emitter (modes 0 and 1).  \n\u2010 Receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 gauge the output in modes 6 and 7.  \n\u2010 Four Bell\u2010pair sources produce entangled photon pairs on edges:  \n   \u2022 E\u2081 between S\u2081 and central node (modes 0\u21942)  \n   \u2022 E\u2082 between S\u2082 and central node (1\u21943)  \n   \u2022 E\u2083 between central node and R\u2082 (4\u21946)  \n   \u2022 E\u2084 between central node and R\u2081 (5\u21947)  \n\nNetwork structure:\n 1. The four Bell\u2010pair sources each probabilistically emit |00>+|11> into their assigned mode pairs.  \n 2. At the central \u201cbutterfly\u201d node, modes {2,3,4,5} enter a fixed linear\u2010optical circuit optimized by Pytheus to perform two simultaneous Bell\u2010state measurements: one on (2,3) and one on (4,5), using ancillary detectors.  \n 3. Successful post\u2010selective click patterns on these four ancilla detectors herald that the two teleported qubits have been routed: \n    \u2012 S\u2081\u2019s original qubit appears in mode 6 (R\u2082)  \n    \u2012 S\u2082\u2019s original qubit appears in mode 7 (R\u2081)  \n 4. No dynamic feed-forward is employed\u2014only post\u2010selection.  \n\nTarget mapping (specified to Pytheus):\nWe demand that for each computational\u2010basis input at senders,\n  |ij>\u2080\u2081 \u2297 (Bell-pairs on E\u2081\u2013E\u2084)\nbe transformed by the network into\n  |ji>\u2086\u2087 \u2297 (herald outcome),\nfor (i,j) \u2208 {0,1}\u00b2.  \nThus the four basis mappings\n  00\u219200, 01\u219210, 10\u219201, 11\u219211\nare enforced in the target quantum\u2010state list. Pytheus is asked to find the linear\u2010optical circuit (beam splitters, phase shifters, ancilla detectors) that realises this 2-qubit network-coded teleportation with maximal success probability.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n\u2010 It is the first post-selected demonstration of quantum network coding in optics.  \n\u2010 It shows how entanglement\u2010swapping techniques can be woven into non-trivial network topologies, going beyond point-to-point or star configurations.  \n\u2010 The same idea extends to higher dimensions (qutrit Network coding) or larger graphs (multicast routing), suggesting a whole family of foundational experiments in quantum networks and nonclassical\u2010light protocols."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nNo ensemble abstracts available.\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: We propose a photonic\u2010linear\u2010optics implementation of quantum network coding in the \u201cbutterfly\u201d topology, demonstrating simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a shared bottleneck node. This combines nonclassical light (single\u2010photon Fock\u2010state qubits and Bell\u2010pair sources) with a genuine quantum protocol (network\u2010coded teleportation).  \n\nDescription of the target network:\n\nParties & Modes:\n\u2010 Senders S\u2081 and S\u2082 each have one unknown qubit encoded in a single\u2010photon emitter (modes 0 and 1).  \n\u2010 Receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 gauge the output in modes 6 and 7.  \n\u2010 Four Bell\u2010pair sources produce entangled photon pairs on edges:  \n   \u2022 E\u2081 between S\u2081 and central node (modes 0\u21942)  \n   \u2022 E\u2082 between S\u2082 and central node (1\u21943)  \n   \u2022 E\u2083 between central node and R\u2082 (4\u21946)  \n   \u2022 E\u2084 between central node and R\u2081 (5\u21947)  \n\nNetwork structure:\n 1. The four Bell\u2010pair sources each probabilistically emit |00>+|11> into their assigned mode pairs.  \n 2. At the central \u201cbutterfly\u201d node, modes {2,3,4,5} enter a fixed linear\u2010optical circuit optimized by Pytheus to perform two simultaneous Bell\u2010state measurements: one on (2,3) and one on (4,5), using ancillary detectors.  \n 3. Successful post\u2010selective click patterns on these four ancilla detectors herald that the two teleported qubits have been routed: \n    \u2012 S\u2081\u2019s original qubit appears in mode 6 (R\u2082)  \n    \u2012 S\u2082\u2019s original qubit appears in mode 7 (R\u2081)  \n 4. No dynamic feed-forward is employed\u2014only post\u2010selection.  \n\nTarget mapping (specified to Pytheus):\nWe demand that for each computational\u2010basis input at senders,\n  |ij>\u2080\u2081 \u2297 (Bell-pairs on E\u2081\u2013E\u2084)\nbe transformed by the network into\n  |ji>\u2086\u2087 \u2297 (herald outcome),\nfor (i,j) \u2208 {0,1}\u00b2.  \nThus the four basis mappings\n  00\u219200, 01\u219210, 10\u219201, 11\u219211\nare enforced in the target quantum\u2010state list. Pytheus is asked to find the linear\u2010optical circuit (beam splitters, phase shifters, ancilla detectors) that realises this 2-qubit network-coded teleportation with maximal success probability.  \n\nWhy it\u2019s interesting & generalizable:\n\u2010 It is the first post-selected demonstration of quantum network coding in optics.  \n\u2010 It shows how entanglement\u2010swapping techniques can be woven into non-trivial network topologies, going beyond point-to-point or star configurations.  \n\u2010 The same idea extends to higher dimensions (qutrit Network coding) or larger graphs (multicast routing), suggesting a whole family of foundational experiments in quantum networks and nonclassical\u2010light protocols.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: This proposal goes beyond standard entanglement swapping or two-party teleportation by embedding teleportation into the butterfly network and demonstrating genuine quantum network coding in a photonic linear\u2010optics setting. To my knowledge no post-selected optical implementation of the classic \u201cbutterfly\u201d quantum network coding has been realized, and the scheme is not a trivial parallel of two independent teleporters \u2013 it intertwines two data streams at a shared bottleneck via a single multiport Bell\u2010measurement module. This constitutes a novel foundational experiment in quantum networks and could spark a family of follow-on tests (higher dimensions, larger graphs). Action: accept Action Input: The experiment demonstrably achieves simultaneous routing and teleportation of two qubits through a bottleneck node in the canonical butterfly topology, something not previously realized in optics. By combining nonclassical single\u2010photon sources, entangled\u2010pair emission, and a single linear\u2010optical central node that performs two simultaneous post-selected Bell measurements, it implements genuine quantum network coding \u2013 a clear conceptual advance over point-to-point or star\u2010type entanglement swapping. This idea is sufficiently novel and nontrivial to warrant further PRL\u2010level investigation."
