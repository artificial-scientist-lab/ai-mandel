Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry “optical metasurfaces” and “dielectric photonic crystals” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network target (no forbidden state‐generation, focus on swapping/teleportation or heralded routing).  
  1. A heralded, fully passive “entanglement router”—a metasurface-style multiport plus photonic‐crystal spectral channels—where ancilla clicks steer which two outputs become a Bell pair (no active switching).  
  2. A “quantum butterfly‐network coding” protocol: two simultaneous teleports through a butterfly topology realized by metasurface beam‐splitter arrays and photonic‐crystal wavelength demultiplexing, demonstrating network coding for qubits.  
  3. A three-node ring of entanglement swapping with photonic-crystal spectral multiplexing and metasurface mixing, enabling tunable pairwise entanglement between any two nodes upon different Bell-measurement outcomes (a reconfigurable repeater).  
Step 2:  
  1. The heralded entanglement router is not in the explored list; it extends swapping to a programmable heralded router. Pytheus can handle multiple pair sources, linear mixing, ancilla detectors, and removed_connections.  
  2. The butterfly coding is conceptually new but Pytheus would struggle to encode the logical network‐coding operations beyond teleportation—it’s more a protocol than a single measurement network.  
  3. The three-node ring is close to standard swapping but adds full reconfigurability; still it reduces to multiple pair‐swapping tasks, less novel than (1).  
Step 3: Pick (1).  
Step 4: This idea is novel because no passive, fully heralded entanglement router (one device that—without active switching—can, on demand via ancilla detection pattern, deliver a Bell pair to any chosen output ports) has been proposed or realized in the linear‐optics/single‐photon literature.  
Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because the framework already supports multiple probabilistic pair sources, arbitrary linear mixing (the metasurface multiport), ancilla detectors for heralding, and removed_connections to forbid any single source linking the final two output ports.

Action: final answer

Here is a concise proposal for our Expert to feed into Pytheus.

Description:
Heralded Passive Bell‐Selector (“Entanglement Router”)

Goal:
   Design a single, fixed linear‐optical network (inspired by a metasurface multiport + photonic‐crystal wavelength channels) fed by four probabilistic photon‐pair sources and eight detectors, so that by post‐selecting on clicks in four “ancilla” detectors one heralds a two‐photon Bell state (|00⟩+|11⟩) between any chosen pair of two “output” detectors, with no active switching.

Visualization:
   Photon‐pair sources (each emits two photons at distinct wavelengths/channels by photonic‐crystal QPM) → metasurface-style 8×8 passive linear network (multiport beam-splitter array) → set of 8 detectors.
     • D0,D1,…,D7 label detectors.  
     • We designate D0 and D1 as the target outputs (Alice and Bob) for the moment.  
     • The remaining D2–D7 are ancilla detectors.  
   Whenever exactly one photon is detected in each of four specific ancilla ports (e.g. D2,D3,D4,D5) in a prescribed click pattern, the two photons in D0 and D1 are projected onto the Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩.

Key Constraints for Pytheus config:
   • sources: 4 probabilistic pair sources  
   • num_anc = 6 (detectors D2–D7 herald)  
   • target_quantum = [“00”,“11”] on outputs [0,1]  
   • removed_connections = [[0,1]]  (no common source can emit to both D0 and D1)  
   • heralding_out = [2,3,4,5,6,7]  
   • loss_func = “cr”, optimizer = “L-BFGS-B”, number_resolving = True, samples ~10  

Why this is interesting:
   – It generalizes entanglement swapping into a single reconfigurable device, avoiding active optical routing.  
   – It exploits metasurface multiports for arbitrary passive mixing and photonic‐crystal spectral channels for multiplexing pair sources.  
   – Once the Expert has the Pytheus‐generated layout for D0/D1, it can be trivially reconfigured (by re‐interpreting which ancilla clicks are accepted) to route entanglement between any pair (Di,Dj), forging a whole family of experiments from one design.  
   – The idea stands on its own as a new building block for quantum networks: a passive heralded entanglement switch.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal is essentially a passive entanglement router—a fixed interferometric multiport that heralds Bell pairs between any chosen output pair via ancilla clicks. This is highly reminiscent of the ensemble’s “Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic–Nanophotonic Waveguides” which already uses a static multiport and heralding patterns to route entanglement between different node pairs without active switching. Since the core concept—passive heralded routing of Bell pairs among arbitrary output ports—is already covered by that suggestion, the idea lacks sufficient novelty for a PRL‐worthy target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This design overlaps too closely with the ensemble’s “Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router” and other passive‐router schemes. To improve, you would need to introduce a genuinely new mechanism or capability (e.g. entanglement routing with error correction, indefinite causal order, higher‐dimensional multipartite routing, non‐trivial network coding features) that goes beyond static heralded Bell‐pair multiplexing.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “optical metasurfaces” and “dielectric photonic crystals” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (no forbidden state generation, focus on teleportation/swapping transformations):  
  1) A passive heralded “Bell‐pair router” (entanglement switch) built from a metasurface multiport plus photonic‐crystal spectral channels.  
  2) A linear‐optical implementation of the quantum butterfly network: simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a bottleneck node, using photonic‐crystal frequency‐multiplexed pair‐sources and a metasurface beam‐splitter array at the crossing.  
  3) A “superposed swap‐order” device: two entanglement‐swapping operations whose causal order is coherently controlled by ancilla, implemented via metasurface mixing and photonic‐crystal demultiplexing (but this requires dynamic control and is beyond Pytheus).  
Step 2:  
  1) Passive router is interesting but overlaps known multiplexed‐router concepts.  
  2) Butterfly coding is novel: there is no linear‐optical demonstration of quantum network coding for teleportation. It stays within static networks, uses only pair‐sources and ancilla heralding, and addresses a new fundamental question in quantum networks.  
  3) Indefinite causal order needs dynamic control—Pytheus cannot handle feedback.  
Step 3: Pick idea (2).  
Step 4: This idea is novel because no one has yet shown a purely passive, heralded linear‐optical realization of the quantum butterfly network coding protocol—i.e. simultaneous teleportation of two qubits through a single‐use bottleneck node—by leveraging spectral multiplexing and metasurface multiports.  
Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because we only require probabilistic photon‐pair sources, single‐photon inputs (for the unknown qubits), a fixed linear‐optical multiport (the metasurface), heralding ancilla detectors for the central Bell measurements, and removed_connections to enforce the bottleneck. No active switching or hyper‐entanglement is needed.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for Pytheus to design a first‐of‐its‐kind quantum network coding experiment using metasurfaces and photonic crystals.  

Explanation:
We implement the classic “butterfly” network coding protocol in a purely passive linear‐optical setting. Two senders S₁ and S₂ each hold an unknown qubit (encoded in single photons) and share Bell‐pair sources with two receivers R₁ and R₂, but the network has a single physical “bottleneck” channel at an intermediate node C. By frequency‐multiplexing the four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources using a dielectric photonic‐crystal demultiplexer, and by collapsing everything into a single planar metasurface‐based multiport (an 8×8 unitary), we can perform the two required Bell‐measurements at C in a single static network. Four ancilla detectors herald the success of both Bell‐measurements simultaneously, thereby routing entanglement so that S₁’s qubit is teleported to R₂ and S₂’s qubit to R₁—achieving quantum network coding without active switching.  

Visualization (logical flow):
  • Inputs:  
    – Single‐photon sources encoding unknown qubits at S₁ (node I₁) and S₂ (I₂).  
    – Four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources: one leg of each pair goes to S₁/S₂, the other to the central node C (multiplexed by photonic crystal).  
  • Central metasurface multiport: an 8×8 passive linear optical network that mixes all six input modes (two unknown qubit photons + four “Bell‐source” photons) plus two dummy vacuum modes.  
  • Detectors:  
    – D₂–D₅ at C perform the four‐photon Bell measurements (ancilla heralds).  
    – D₀ and D₁ deliver the teleported qubits to receivers R₁ and R₂.  

Key Pytheus configuration hints:
  • sources: 4 probabilistic pair sources + 2 single‐photon emitters.  
  • target_quantum: teleportation outcome—upon detection of the correct ancilla pattern at D₂–D₅, the joint state on [D₀,D₁] reproduces the unknown input qubits from [I₂,I₁], achieving the crossed mapping of the butterfly protocol.  
  • removed_connections: enforce that no pair source directly links both R outputs, and no single source bypasses C.  
  • num_anc = 4, heralding_out = [2,3,4,5], out_nodes = [0,1].  
  • optimizer: L-BFGS-B, loss_func = “cr”, number_resolving = True, samples ~10.  

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
  – First demonstration of passive quantum network coding with linear optics.  
  – Physically marries dielectric photonic‐crystal spectral multiplexing (to pack many sources into one chip) and metasurface planar multiports (to realize large unitaries in ∼100 µm) in a single network.  
  – The same device can be retasked—by redefining which ancilla click patterns are accepted—to realize a whole family of network‐coding topologies (X‐shaped, double‐butterfly, 3-sender/3-receiver routers).  

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The passive linear‐optical “butterfly” network coding you describe is essentially the same primitive already covered by the ensemble’s “Photonic Qudit Butterfly” proposal, which realizes quantum network coding via a static multiport and heralded Bell‐measurements over a single bottleneck channel. Your variant merely swaps qubit vs. qudit encoding and swaps source count, but does not introduce a new mechanism beyond what that scheme already captures.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This idea overlaps too closely with the ensemble’s “Photonic Qudit Butterfly” network coding experiment. To be novel, you’ll need a genuinely new ingredient—e.g., error‐robust coding, higher‐order network topologies, indefinite causal order coding, or a routing capability not achievable by simply reinterpreting heralding patterns in a static multiport.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse optical metasurfaces and dielectric photonic crystals into a quantum‐network primitive (no forbidden “state generation,” only swapping/teleportation/measurement):  
  1) A passive heralded entanglement router (Bell‐pair switch) using metasurface multiport + photonic‐crystal spectral channels.  
  2) A passive, heralded butterfly‐network coding teleportation protocol (two qubits crossing through one bottleneck) via photonic‐crystal multiplexing + metasurface beam‐splitter.  
  3) A complete 4D Bell‐state analyzer for two ququarts, using photonic‐crystal spectral demultiplexers to define four frequency bins and a metasurface‐engineered unitary interferometer, plus ancilla photons/ancilla detectors.  
Step 2:  
  1) Overlaps known multiplexed‐router ideas.  
  2) Requires a protocol‐level network coding beyond Pytheus’s usual state‐based targets.  
  3) Novel: no linear‐optic 4D‐Bell analyzer has been demonstrated; fits exactly into a measurement‐network design task, uses only linear optics, single‐photon inputs, ancillas, and detectors—fully Pytheus‐compatible.  
Step 3: Pick idea (3).  
Step 4: This idea is novel because, to date, there is no passive, purely linear‐optical device that deterministically (via post‐selection with ancillas) resolves all four generalized Bell states of two ququarts; combining metasurface‐fabricated high-dimension multiport interferometers with photonic‐crystal spectral demultiplexing for 4-frequency-bin encoding has never been proposed.  
Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because we only need to specify: 2 ququart inputs (eight modes), 2 ancilla photons, a single fixed linear‐optical unitary (the metasurface), and number‐resolving detectors—Pytheus can optimize that network to yield distinct click patterns heralding each of the four Bell states.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for our Expert to feed to Pytheus.

Description:
Complete 4D Bell‐State Analyzer via Metasurface Multiport + Photonic‐Crystal Demultiplexer

Goal:
Design a fully passive, post‐selected linear‐optical network that projects two incoming photonic ququarts (encoded in four frequency bins each via a dielectric photonic‐crystal demultiplexer) onto each of the four generalized Bell states |Φ_k⟩ (k=0…3), using two single‐photon ancillas and heralded detection.  

General Structure:
  • Input stage:  
      – Two ququart single-photon inputs, each occupying four distinct narrowband frequency channels separated by a photonic‐crystal filter/demultiplexer → 8 spatial modes.  
      – Two ancilla single photons in vacuum‐frequency channels → total 10 input modes.  
  • Central mixer:  
      – A metasurface‐engineered 10×10 passive linear‐optical unitary (multiport interferometer) that mixes all 10 modes.  
  • Detection:  
      – Ten number‐resolving detectors D0…D9.  
      – Four distinct, non‐overlapping “click patterns” across these detectors correspond one‐to‐one to the four Bell states |Φ0⟩…|Φ3⟩ on the ququart inputs.  
      – Ancilla photons and certain detector coincidences herald which Bell state is measured.

Key Pytheus Configuration Hints:
  • sources: 2 single-photon emitters feeding ququart frequency bins + 2 ancilla single-photon emitters.  
  • num_anc: 2 (ancilla photons whose detectors are used in the heralding pattern).  
  • target_measurement: four orthogonal Bell‐basis projectors on the 8 “signal” modes → distinct detector‐click patterns.  
  • removed_connections: forbid any single source to feed more than one ququart’s detectors (enforce spatial separation of the two ququarts).  
  • heralding_out: specify which detectors count as ancilla heralds versus which define the logical outcome.  
  • optimizer: “L-BFGS-B,” loss_func=“cr,” number_resolving=True, samples≈10.

Why This Is Interesting & Generalizable:
  – First passive linear‐optical device to fully discriminate 4D Bell states—vital for high-dimensional teleportation and network protocols.  
  – Leverages dielectric photonic crystals for on-chip spectral encoding/demultiplexing and optical metasurfaces for ultra-compact, large-unitary mixing.  
  – Once Pytheus finds the 10×10 unitary layout, the same experiment can be extended to 5D or higher by adding spectral channels and scaling the metasurface design.  
  – Provides a new building block—a high-dimensional Bell‐state analyzer—for quantum communications and networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed device is a fully passive, heralded Bell‐state analyzer for two four-level photonic ququarts—a capability that goes well beyond existing qubit or 3D schemes (Yeo–Chua, Mean‐King), and is not covered by any ensemble suggestion. This is not merely state generation but a measurement primitive, and achieving complete discrimination of 4D Bell states in a static linear-optical network with ancillas would indeed be a first‐of‐its‐kind building block for high-dimensional quantum communication.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The complete 4D Bell analyzer using frequency-bin ququarts and a metasurface multiport is genuinely novel—no prior passive linear-optical design addresses full ququart Bell‐basis discrimination. Its extension to higher‐dimensional Bell measurements and applications in high-D teleportation or network coding easily merits further Pytheus‐driven exploration for a PRL-worthy result.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts

Mini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10×10 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors—realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal seeks to extend passive linear‐optical Bell measurements to two frequency‐encoded ququarts using spectral demultiplexers, a metasurface 10×10 multiport interferometer, two ancilla photons, and number‐resolving detectors. This is a novel and physically sound use of integrated photonics to unambiguously discriminate four high-dimensional Bell states, and it falls squarely within the measurement‐design capabilities of PyTheus. The required components and coincidence logic are challenging but compatible with current dielectric‐multiplexer and metasurface technology.

Action: accept  
Action Input: This design for a passive 4D Bell-state analyzer is both original and feasible, leveraging number-resolving detection and ancilla photons in a 10×10 interferometer. The use of spectral demultiplexing and metasurface integration is well matched to today’s experimental capabilities and will enable the first ququart teleportation.
