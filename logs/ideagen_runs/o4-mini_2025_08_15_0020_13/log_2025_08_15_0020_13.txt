    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum aggregation with temporal delay\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Quantum Expander Mixing Lemma and its Converse\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Describing two-mode squeezed-light experiments without two-mode\n  entanglement or squeezing\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas. THE FEEDBACK IS INCREDIBLE IMPORTANT !!! FOR SURE LOOK AT THEM AND UNDERSTAND THE CORE IDEA OF THEM!! YOU HAVE FAILED SO OFTEN BEFORE, FREAKING TAKE IT SERIOUS!\n\nSTART OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n<existing_feedback>\nEND OF FEEDBACK RECORD\n\nThis feedback is extremely important and very valuable information. It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

The ancillary particles are measured by a third party. Similar to the standard entanglement swapping experiment (entangling two qubits), the third party allows the entanglement of A&B with C&D.\\n\\nThe reason why this experiment is interesting, is that an entanglement swapping experiment entangling two single qutrits would require four ancillary photons. So to independently create two three-dimensional Bell pairs non-locally, one would require eight ancillary particles.\\n\\nBy creating both pairs in a single setup we require two less ancillary particles to achieve the same task.\", 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of two qutrits each.', 'foldername': '2pES_3d', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 0.0001, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 6, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['0000', '0101', '0202', '1010', '1111', '1212', '2020', '2121', '2222'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought: \nStep 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus\u2010compatible ways to weave together \u201cdigital quantum computer\u201d (DQC) and \u201cquantum phase estimation\u201d (QPE) in a photonic network without making the target a pure state generation:\n  1. Teleportation-Based Distributed QPE: sequentially teleport a single\u2010photon \u201cprobe\u201d to remote phase-shifter nodes via Bell\u2010pair entanglement\u2010swapping, then bring it back to a central station for a two-ancilla inverse\u2010QFT interferometer\u2014no active feed-forward, only post-selection.\n  2. Modular Multiport QFT Gate via Entanglement Swapping: build a heralded 2-qubit QFT unitary by gluing two 1-qubit Fourier modules together with entanglement\u2010swapping blocks. This realizes a core DQC building block used in QPE.\n  3. Phase-Conditioned Quantum Router: use a QPE\u2010style subcircuit to read out the phase of an ancilla photon and then, via a teleported CNOT network, route a data photon to different outputs depending on the estimated phase bit.  \nStep 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:\n  1. The teleportation-based QPE (Idea #1) is novel\u2014no one has suggested distributing QPE via pure entanglement swapping in photonics\u2014and Pytheus can handle post-selected teleportation and static multiport interferometers.\n  2. Modular QFT (Idea #2) is essentially state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art in photonic gate design (people have proposed linear\u2010optic Fourier), plus it drifts toward pure gate synthesis rather than a larger quantum network.\n  3. Phase-Conditioned Router (Idea #3) is very cool but introduces a logical \u201crouting\u201d function that Pytheus would have to turn into a controlled\u2010swap network plus QPE and teleportation, pushing beyond its current examples.  \nStep 3: Pick the most promising: the Teleportation-Based Distributed QPE (#1).\nStep 4: This idea is novel because it turns the canonical digital\u2010quantum\u2010computer subroutine QPE into a fully photonic, purely post\u2010selected, teleportation\u2010driven network: the probe never physically traverses all phase elements but hops by entanglement\u2010swapping, and the final inverse QFT is built into a static multiport.\nStep 5: It is feasible for Pytheus because it uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon injectors for the two ancilla Hadamards, linear-optical Bell measurements (post-selected), static phase shifters (the unknown is treated as a fixed U\u03c6 in the abstract state), and a fixed 4-mode interferometer for the 2-qubit inverse QFT, followed by photon-number detection. No dynamic feed-forward or cavities are needed, and the pattern of removed connections enforces true teleportation steps.  \nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:  \nHere is a concrete target for Pytheus\u2014 a \u201cTeleportation-Enabled Quantum Phase Estimation\u201d network.

Instead teleport the probe to the phase\u2010shifter station twice (once for U\u03c6\u00b2, once for U\u03c6), then return it to a central \u201creader\u201d where a 2-qubit inverse QFT interferometer reveals the two bits of \u03c6/2\u03c0.\n  \n  \u2022 Resources:\n    \u2013 Probe photon in eigenstate |\u03c8\u27e9 (abstract single qubit).\n    \u2013 Two ancilla photons prepared in |+\u27e9 states via post-selected Hadamard subcircuits.\n    \u2013 Three Bell\u2010pair sources:\n        S\u2081 entangles Probe \u2194 T\u2081,\n        S\u2082 entangles T\u2081 \u2194 central \u201creturn\u201d node,\n        S\u2083 entangles T\u2082 \u2194 central node.\n    \u2013 Two teleportation modules (linear optics + photon\u2010number detectors, post\u2010select on the no\u2010correction outcome): \n        \u2022 Teleport Probe\u2192 remote U\u03c6\u00b2 station via S\u2081, measure Bell \u2192 apply U\u03c6\u00b2.\n        \u2022 Teleport Probe\u2192 remote U\u03c6^1 station via S\u2082, measure \u2192 apply U\u03c6.\n    \u2013 A static 4-mode interferometer implementing the 2-qubit inverse Quantum Fourier Transform on the two ancilla photons plus the returned Probe (ancilla carry\u2010in).\n    \u2013 Photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detectors at the four output modes that register the two phase bits b\u2081,b\u2080.\n\n  \u2022 Structure Visualization (top\u2010down):\n    [Ancilla sources for |+>\u2081 and |+>\u2082] \u2192 \n    [Teleportation module #1 (Bell measurement) \u2194 S\u2081 & U\u03c6\u00b2 block] \u2192\n    [Teleportation module #2 (Bell measurement) \u2194 S\u2082 & U\u03c6 block] \u2192\n    [4-mode inverse-QFT interferometer] \u2192\n    [Detectors: measure two ancilla output modes \u2192 bits b\u2081,b\u2080; probe output is discarded].\n\n  \u2022 Pytheus config hints:\n    \u2013 num_anc_detectors = 4 (for the two teleportation Bell-measure modules).\n    \u2013 single_emitters = [] (use probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources exclusively).\n    \u2013 removed_connections: forbid any direct source that sends a photon simultaneously to a teleportation input and a final ancilla input, enforcing the \u201chop\u201d structure (e.g. no direct pair from Probe source to central QFT inputs).\n    \u2013 target_quantum: an abstract three-qubit mapping that, upon post-selection of the two teleportation Bell pairs and the two ancilla |+> preparations, yields the final ancilla modes in a product computational basis state |b\u2081b\u2080\u27e9\u2014i.e. the phase bits.  \n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n  1. It is a direct photonic translation of the DQC subroutine \u201cquantum phase estimation\u201d into a purely linear-optic, post-selected network\u2014no cavities, no feed-forward.\n  2. It uses entanglement swapping (teleportation) to distribute the algorithm\u2019s controlled-U operations across remote nodes, opening the door to truly distributed phase metrology.\n  3. The 2-bit version is a neat Phys. Rev. Lett. length paper; scaling to K bits simply adds more ancilla photons, teleportation modules, and expands the inverse QFT multiport\u2014Pytheus can optimize each instance automatically.\n  4. This setup touches both \u201cdigital quantum computer\u201d (we implement a QPE subcircuit) and \u201cquantum phase estimation\u201d (we estimate \u03c6) in the language of quantum networks, all within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Robust Photonic Qubit Teleportation via Topologically Protected Edge-State Entanglement in an SSH Ladder\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and implement teleportation of a photonic qubit from mode 0 to mode 7 across a two-leg Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger ladder by generating and post-selecting a Bell-state between the topologically protected edge modes (0 and 7). Using only linear optics\u2014probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla-mediated Bell measurements on weak bonds, and removal of unwanted connections\u2014we target the entanglement of end modes 0 & 7 to achieve disorder-resilient qubit transfer via multi-path interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Integrated Spectral Interferometer for Direct Entanglement Spectrum Readout of the Partial-SWAP Gate U(\u03b8)\n\nAbstract: We design a static six-mode LOQC network that heraldedly implements the two-qubit partial-SWAP unitary U(\u03b8) on photonic modes (a,b) while simultaneously diagonalizing its Choi operator to output the entanglement eigenvalues \u03bc\u2081(\u03b8), \u03bc\u2082(\u03b8) in one shot. By embedding SPDC-based heralded gate application with a two-copy spectral interferometer built from beam splitters, phase shifters, and detectors in Pythius, our integrated device produces click probabilities {\u03bc\u2081\u00b2,\u03bc\u2082\u00b2,2\u03bc\u2081\u03bc\u2082,0}, enabling real-time characterization of U(\u03b8)\u2019s entangling power.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Two-Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network\n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose and analyze a one-shot multi-hop entanglement swap that compresses two sequential Bell-pair swaps across the target network A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D into a single four-photon joint interference measurement.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'. Some parallels can be ok, but the goal should be to have an actually novel experiment with a novel target. You should also reject proposals that are trivial extensions of known experiments. If you can, point out the exact experiment or result as a reason for your rejection.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for rejecting the idea and what has to be improved.)\n\nOR \n\nThought: (reflect on the idea given by the researcher and whether it can be considered novel.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'accept')\nAction Input: (express your reasoning for accepting the idea.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a concrete target for Pytheus\u2014 a \u201cTeleportation-Enabled Quantum Phase Estimation\u201d network.

Instead teleport the probe to the phase\u2010shifter station twice (once for U\u03c6\u00b2, once for U\u03c6), then return it to a central \u201creader\u201d where a 2-qubit inverse QFT interferometer reveals the two bits of \u03c6/2\u03c0.\n  \n  \u2022 Resources:\n    \u2013 Probe photon in eigenstate |\u03c8\u27e9 (abstract single qubit).\n    \u2013 Two ancilla photons prepared in |+\u27e9 states via post-selected Hadamard subcircuits.\n    \u2013 Three Bell\u2010pair sources:\n        S\u2081 entangles Probe \u2194 T\u2081,\n        S\u2082 entangles T\u2081 \u2194 central \u201creturn\u201d node,\n        S\u2083 entangles T\u2082 \u2194 central node.\n    \u2013 Two teleportation modules (linear optics + photon\u2010number detectors, post\u2010select on the no\u2010correction outcome): \n        \u2022 Teleport Probe\u2192 remote U\u03c6\u00b2 station via S\u2081, measure Bell \u2192 apply U\u03c6\u00b2.\n        \u2022 Teleport Probe\u2192 remote U\u03c6^1 station via S\u2082, measure \u2192 apply U\u03c6.\n    \u2013 A static 4-mode interferometer implementing the 2-qubit inverse Quantum Fourier Transform on the two ancilla photons plus the returned Probe (ancilla carry\u2010in).\n    \u2013 Photon\u2010number\u2013resolving detectors at the four output modes that register the two phase bits b\u2081,b\u2080.\n\n  \u2022 Structure Visualization (top\u2010down):\n    [Ancilla sources for |+>\u2081 and |+>\u2082] \u2192 \n    [Teleportation module #1 (Bell measurement) \u2194 S\u2081 & U\u03c6\u00b2 block] \u2192\n    [Teleportation module #2 (Bell measurement) \u2194 S\u2082 & U\u03c6 block] \u2192\n    [4-mode inverse-QFT interferometer] \u2192\n    [Detectors: measure two ancilla output modes \u2192 bits b\u2081,b\u2080; probe output is discarded].\n\n  \u2022 Pytheus config hints:\n    \u2013 num_anc_detectors = 4 (for the two teleportation Bell-measure modules).\n    \u2013 single_emitters = [] (use probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources exclusively).\n    \u2013 removed_connections: forbid any direct source that sends a photon simultaneously to a teleportation input and a final ancilla input, enforcing the \u201chop\u201d structure (e.g. no direct pair from Probe source to central QFT inputs).\n    \u2013 target_quantum: an abstract three-qubit mapping that, upon post-selection of the two teleportation Bell pairs and the two ancilla |+> preparations, yields the final ancilla modes in a product computational basis state |b\u2081b\u2080\u27e9\u2014i.e. the phase bits.  \n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n  1. It is a direct photonic translation of the DQC subroutine \u201cquantum phase estimation\u201d into a purely linear-optic, post-selected network\u2014no cavities, no feed-forward.\n  2. It uses entanglement swapping (teleportation) to distribute the algorithm\u2019s controlled-U operations across remote nodes, opening the door to truly distributed phase metrology.\n  3. The 2-bit version is a neat Phys. Rev. Lett. length paper; scaling to K bits simply adds more ancilla photons, teleportation modules, and expands the inverse QFT multiport\u2014Pytheus can optimize each instance automatically.\n  4. This setup touches both \u201cdigital quantum computer\u201d (we implement a QPE subcircuit) and \u201cquantum phase estimation\u201d (we estimate \u03c6) in the language of quantum networks, all within Pytheus\u2019s capabilities.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: This proposal lays out a genuinely new \u201cteleportation\u2010enabled\u201d implementation of the canonical quantum\u2010phase-estimation subroutine in a purely linear-optical, post-selected setting. Unlike the many entanglement-swapping, Bell-fusion, or holonomic-teleportation circuits in the ensemble, here teleportation modules play the role of distributed controlled-U^j gates and a static multiport performs an inverse QFT, yielding phase\u2010bit outcomes without any cavities or active feed-forward. I am not aware of any prior LOQC scheme that maps the full digital QPE algorithm into entanglement-swapped teleportation steps in this way, nor of any trivial extension of an existing PRL-level experiment. This bridges foundational quantum computing and quantum metrology in a photonic network, and scales to K bits in a straightforward yet nontrivial fashion. Action: accept Action Input: This target is novel, implements a fundamental algorithmic primitive (QPE) via teleportation in LOQC, and could open a new avenue for distributed photonic phase\u2010metrology and networked quantum computing."
