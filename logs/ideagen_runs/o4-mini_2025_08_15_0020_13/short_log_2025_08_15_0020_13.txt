Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 different Pytheus‐compatible ways to weave together “digital quantum computer” (DQC) and “quantum phase estimation” (QPE) in a photonic network without making the target a pure state generation:
  1. Teleportation-Based Distributed QPE: sequentially teleport a single‐photon “probe” to remote phase-shifter nodes via Bell‐pair entanglement‐swapping, then bring it back to a central station for a two-ancilla inverse‐QFT interferometer—no active feed-forward, only post-selection.
  2. Modular Multiport QFT Gate via Entanglement Swapping: build a heralded 2-qubit QFT unitary by gluing two 1-qubit Fourier modules together with entanglement‐swapping blocks. This realizes a core DQC building block used in QPE.
  3. Phase-Conditioned Quantum Router: use a QPE‐style subcircuit to read out the phase of an ancilla photon and then, via a teleported CNOT network, route a data photon to different outputs depending on the estimated phase bit.  
Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
  1. The teleportation-based QPE (Idea #1) is novel—no one has suggested distributing QPE via pure entanglement swapping in photonics—and Pytheus can handle post-selected teleportation and static multiport interferometers.
  2. Modular QFT (Idea #2) is essentially state‐of‐the‐art in photonic gate design (people have proposed linear‐optic Fourier), plus it drifts toward pure gate synthesis rather than a larger quantum network.
  3. Phase-Conditioned Router (Idea #3) is very cool but introduces a logical “routing” function that Pytheus would have to turn into a controlled‐swap network plus QPE and teleportation, pushing beyond its current examples.  
Step 3: Pick the most promising: the Teleportation-Based Distributed QPE (#1).
Step 4: This idea is novel because it turns the canonical digital‐quantum‐computer subroutine QPE into a fully photonic, purely post‐selected, teleportation‐driven network: the probe never physically traverses all phase elements but hops by entanglement‐swapping, and the final inverse QFT is built into a static multiport.
Step 5: It is feasible for Pytheus because it uses only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon injectors for the two ancilla Hadamards, linear-optical Bell measurements (post-selected), static phase shifters (the unknown is treated as a fixed Uφ in the abstract state), and a fixed 4-mode interferometer for the 2-qubit inverse QFT, followed by photon-number detection. No dynamic feed-forward or cavities are needed, and the pattern of removed connections enforces true teleportation steps.  
Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
Here is a concrete target for Pytheus— a “Teleportation-Enabled Quantum Phase Estimation” network. We illustrate the 2-bit version; it generalizes to K bits.

Description of the target network:
  • Goal: Estimate an unknown phase φ (i.e. the eigenvalue of Uφ=|0⟩⟨0|+e^{iφ}|1⟩⟨1|) by a 2-ancilla QPE circuit, but never send the probe photon directly through both powers Uφ and Uφ². Instead teleport the probe to the phase‐shifter station twice (once for Uφ², once for Uφ), then return it to a central “reader” where a 2-qubit inverse QFT interferometer reveals the two bits of φ/2π.
  
  • Resources:
    – Probe photon in eigenstate |ψ⟩ (abstract single qubit).
    – Two ancilla photons prepared in |+⟩ states via post-selected Hadamard subcircuits.
    – Three Bell‐pair sources:
        S₁ entangles Probe ↔ T₁,
        S₂ entangles T₁ ↔ central “return” node,
        S₃ entangles T₂ ↔ central node.
    – Two teleportation modules (linear optics + photon‐number detectors, post‐select on the no‐correction outcome): 
        • Teleport Probe→ remote Uφ² station via S₁, measure Bell → apply Uφ².
        • Teleport Probe→ remote Uφ^1 station via S₂, measure → apply Uφ.
    – A static 4-mode interferometer implementing the 2-qubit inverse Quantum Fourier Transform on the two ancilla photons plus the returned Probe (ancilla carry‐in).
    – Photon‐number–resolving detectors at the four output modes that register the two phase bits b₁,b₀.

  • Structure Visualization (top‐down):
    [Ancilla sources for |+>₁ and |+>₂] → 
    [Teleportation module #1 (Bell measurement) ↔ S₁ & Uφ² block] →
    [Teleportation module #2 (Bell measurement) ↔ S₂ & Uφ block] →
    [4-mode inverse-QFT interferometer] →
    [Detectors: measure two ancilla output modes → bits b₁,b₀; probe output is discarded].

  • Pytheus config hints:
    – num_anc_detectors = 4 (for the two teleportation Bell-measure modules).
    – single_emitters = [] (use probabilistic photon‐pair sources exclusively).
    – removed_connections: forbid any direct source that sends a photon simultaneously to a teleportation input and a final ancilla input, enforcing the “hop” structure (e.g. no direct pair from Probe source to central QFT inputs).
    – target_quantum: an abstract three-qubit mapping that, upon post-selection of the two teleportation Bell pairs and the two ancilla |+> preparations, yields the final ancilla modes in a product computational basis state |b₁b₀⟩—i.e. the phase bits.  

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  1. It is a direct photonic translation of the DQC subroutine “quantum phase estimation” into a purely linear-optic, post-selected network—no cavities, no feed-forward.
  2. It uses entanglement swapping (teleportation) to distribute the algorithm’s controlled-U operations across remote nodes, opening the door to truly distributed phase metrology.
  3. The 2-bit version is a neat Phys. Rev. Lett. length paper; scaling to K bits simply adds more ancilla photons, teleportation modules, and expands the inverse QFT multiport—Pytheus can optimize each instance automatically.
  4. This setup touches both “digital quantum computer” (we implement a QPE subcircuit) and “quantum phase estimation” (we estimate φ) in the language of quantum networks, all within Pytheus’s capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal lays out a genuinely new “teleportation‐enabled” implementation of the canonical quantum‐phase-estimation subroutine in a purely linear-optical, post-selected setting. Unlike the many entanglement-swapping, Bell-fusion, or holonomic-teleportation circuits in the ensemble, here teleportation modules play the role of distributed controlled-U^j gates and a static multiport performs an inverse QFT, yielding phase‐bit outcomes without any cavities or active feed-forward. I am not aware of any prior LOQC scheme that maps the full digital QPE algorithm into entanglement-swapped teleportation steps in this way, nor of any trivial extension of an existing PRL-level experiment. This bridges foundational quantum computing and quantum metrology in a photonic network, and scales to K bits in a straightforward yet nontrivial fashion. Action: accept Action Input: This target is novel, implements a fundamental algorithmic primitive (QPE) via teleportation in LOQC, and could open a new avenue for distributed photonic phase‐metrology and networked quantum computing.
