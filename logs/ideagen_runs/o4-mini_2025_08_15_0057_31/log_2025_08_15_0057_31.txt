    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5. Instead of discarding these ancillas, a fixed Bell\u2010type measurement on three ancilla detectors (6,7,8) \u201cunlocks\u201d a Bell component (|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2 on the target modes 0 and 3\u2014even for damping rates that individually preclude entanglement\u2014thereby directly probing resource\u2010theoretic superactivation in a minimal linear\u2010optics network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid Concentration-Swap of Two Qutrit Bell Pairs into One Qubit Bell Pair\n\nAbstract: We introduce a heralded linear-optical protocol that concentrates two independent three-level (qutrit) Bell pairs into a single two-level (qubit) Bell pair by mixing the local qutrit halves with ancillary single-photon modes and photon-number-resolving detection at the central node. Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Agnostic Teleportation via a Single Four-Photon Joint Measurement\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe realize the PyTheus-compatible target of phase-invariant quantum teleportation across an unknown-detuned repeater by employing one symmetric four-photon joint detection that exactly cancels the cavity detuning \u03c6 on node B. In this purely passive linear-optical protocol, an arbitrary qubit encoded in node A\u2019s photonic Bell pair is heraldedly transferred onto node C\u2019s matter qubit using only fixed beam splitters, phase shifters, vacuum ancillas, and number-resolving detectors, with no active tuning or feedback required.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward.

A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical SPA-PT Supermap for Direct Entanglement Negativity and Concurrent CHSH Testing\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a heralded linear-optical supermap that realizes the structural-physical approximation to the partial transpose (SPA-PT)\u2014our target transformation\u2014on one copy of an unknown two-qubit state, producing an output whose fidelity directly yields the state\u2019s entanglement negativity.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality.

By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical SPA-PT Supermap for Direct Entanglement Negativity and Concurrent CHSH Testing\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a heralded linear-optical supermap that realizes the structural-physical approximation to the partial transpose (SPA-PT)\u2014our target transformation\u2014on one copy of an unknown two-qubit state, producing an output whose fidelity directly yields the state\u2019s entanglement negativity. Simultaneously, a second untouched copy is routed to a standard CHSH Bell-test network, enabling parallel measurement of conventional nonlocal correlations and negativity using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, vacuum ancilla, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

A controlled\u2010swap of entanglement: a qubit from a single\u2010emitter control decides whether two SPDC\u2010produced Bell pairs are swapped or left alone, creating a coherent superposition of two network topologies.\n    2. A quantum butterfly (network\u2010coding) protocol: two input qubits at A and C are \u201ccross\u2010teleported\u201d to outputs B and D in one step, using SPDC entangled resources for the inputs and single\u2010emitter photons for the intermediate Bell projections.\n    3.

Butterfly network coding is absent from the existing list, is a genuine network transformation, and can be phrased as a 4\u2010qubit \u201ccross\u2010teleportation\u201d target. It uses only SPDC, single_emitters, linear optics, and post\u2010selection\u2014Pytheus compatible.\n    3. Quantum switch is elegant but again ends up as an entangled state generation of control+output\u2014too close to state generation.\n  Step 3: The quantum butterfly network coding primitive (option 2) is most promising: it is a bona\u2010fide network transformation, novel in pytheus, meets all constraints, and combines both regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because pytheus has never tackled a quantum\u2010network\u2010coding task (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) and it goes beyond simple swapping or teleportation by delivering two qubits across a cross\u2010connected network in one go.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (weak excitation), single\u2010photon emitters (strong coupling), static linear\u2010optical mixing, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no forbidden state-generation prescription.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for pytheus: implement the minimum \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network\u2010coding primitive by \u201ccross\u2010teleporting\u201d two input qubits at nodes A and C onto outputs B and D simultaneously.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe label detectors 0\u20133 as the four logical qubits:  \n  \u2022 0 = A_in  \n  \u2022 1 = C_in  \n  \u2022 2 = B_out  \n  \u2022 3 = D_out  \n\nGoal: Starting from an arbitrary two\u2010qubit input |x\u27e9\u2080|y\u27e9\u2081, the network will deliver |x\u27e9 to output 3 (D_out) and |y\u27e9 to output 2 (B_out) in one static linear-optical circuit.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superactivation-Assisted Entanglement Distribution Under Amplitude Damping\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment in which two probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources generate Bell pairs on modes (0,1) and (2,3), and modes 1 & 2 traverse amplitude\u2010damped channels modeled by beam splitters coupling into ancilla modes 4 & 5.

Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is not in the existing list (which has SPDC\u2010only qutrit swaps or single\u2010emitter qutrit swaps), and Pytheus can handle it (pair_sources + single_emitters + static interferometer + post-selection).  \n  Step 3: Pick (c) as the most promising: it\u2019s a fundamental repeater\u2010link primitive, generalizable to N hops by trading SPDC sources for emitters, and independent of implementation success.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design (or published linear\u2010optical experiment) demonstrates an entanglement swap where one of the two Bell\u2010pairs is generated by two on\u2010demand single\u2010photon emitters, thereby halving the probabilistic\u2010ancilla cost.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because we only require: (i) one SPDC pair_source, (ii) two single_emitters that Pytheus can route and interfere to form a Bell\u2010pair, (iii) a static linear\u2010optical network mixing the three \u201cdata\u201d photons plus two ancilla modes, and (iv) post-selection on two heralding detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or forbidden state-generation.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target for a hybrid entanglement\u2010swap link:\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to entangle node A (detector 0) and node D (detector 1) by swapping two Bell\u2010pairs:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 1 (weak-excitation): an SPDC source S emits two photons into modes [A1, X].  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 2 (strong\u2010coupling): two on-demand single\u2010photon emitters E1, E2 each emit one photon; Pytheus will optimize a small interferometer + post-selection on those two photons to produce a Bell\u2010pair into modes [Y, D1].  \nA single Bell\u2010measurement is then performed on the two \u201cmiddle\u201d photons in modes [X,Y] via a linear\u2010optical mixer and two heralding detectors (2, 3).

The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical SPA-PT Supermap for Direct Entanglement Negativity and Concurrent CHSH Testing\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a heralded linear-optical supermap that realizes the structural-physical approximation to the partial transpose (SPA-PT)\u2014our target transformation\u2014on one copy of an unknown two-qubit state, producing an output whose fidelity directly yields the state\u2019s entanglement negativity. Simultaneously, a second untouched copy is routed to a standard CHSH Bell-test network, enabling parallel measurement of conventional nonlocal correlations and negativity using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, vacuum ancilla, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Coherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a generalized three-photon entanglement-swapping protocol\u2014targeting \u201cCoherence-Assisted Entanglement Swapping under Amplitude Damping\u201d\u2014in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources and an auxiliary single-photon coherence qubit each traverse independent amplitude-damping channels. A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Quantum switch is elegant but again ends up as an entangled state generation of control+output\u2014too close to state generation.\n  Step 3: The quantum butterfly network coding primitive (option 2) is most promising: it is a bona\u2010fide network transformation, novel in pytheus, meets all constraints, and combines both regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because pytheus has never tackled a quantum\u2010network\u2010coding task (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) and it goes beyond simple swapping or teleportation by delivering two qubits across a cross\u2010connected network in one go.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (weak excitation), single\u2010photon emitters (strong coupling), static linear\u2010optical mixing, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no forbidden state-generation prescription.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for pytheus: implement the minimum \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network\u2010coding primitive by \u201ccross\u2010teleporting\u201d two input qubits at nodes A and C onto outputs B and D simultaneously.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe label detectors 0\u20133 as the four logical qubits:  \n  \u2022 0 = A_in  \n  \u2022 1 = C_in  \n  \u2022 2 = B_out  \n  \u2022 3 = D_out  \n\nGoal: Starting from an arbitrary two\u2010qubit input |x\u27e9\u2080|y\u27e9\u2081, the network will deliver |x\u27e9 to output 3 (D_out) and |y\u27e9 to output 2 (B_out) in one static linear-optical circuit.

It is not in the existing list (which has SPDC\u2010only qutrit swaps or single\u2010emitter qutrit swaps), and Pytheus can handle it (pair_sources + single_emitters + static interferometer + post-selection).  \n  Step 3: Pick (c) as the most promising: it\u2019s a fundamental repeater\u2010link primitive, generalizable to N hops by trading SPDC sources for emitters, and independent of implementation success.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design (or published linear\u2010optical experiment) demonstrates an entanglement swap where one of the two Bell\u2010pairs is generated by two on\u2010demand single\u2010photon emitters, thereby halving the probabilistic\u2010ancilla cost.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because we only require: (i) one SPDC pair_source, (ii) two single_emitters that Pytheus can route and interfere to form a Bell\u2010pair, (iii) a static linear\u2010optical network mixing the three \u201cdata\u201d photons plus two ancilla modes, and (iv) post-selection on two heralding detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or forbidden state-generation.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target for a hybrid entanglement\u2010swap link:\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to entangle node A (detector 0) and node D (detector 1) by swapping two Bell\u2010pairs:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 1 (weak-excitation): an SPDC source S emits two photons into modes [A1, X].  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 2 (strong\u2010coupling): two on-demand single\u2010photon emitters E1, E2 each emit one photon; Pytheus will optimize a small interferometer + post-selection on those two photons to produce a Bell\u2010pair into modes [Y, D1].  \nA single Bell\u2010measurement is then performed on the two \u201cmiddle\u201d photons in modes [X,Y] via a linear\u2010optical mixer and two heralding detectors (2, 3).

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

    "output": "Thought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus\u2010compatible primitives mixing weak\u2010excitation SPDC pairs and strong-coupling single emitters into a nontrivial quantum-network transformation (not mere state generation):\n    1. A hybrid \u201cquantum router\u201d that uses an on-demand emitter qubit to steer one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of two output nodes, thereby routing entanglement in superposition.\n    2. A \u201ccontrolled-teleportation\u201d gate: a single-emitter control photon switches between direct transmission and SPDC-based teleportation of an input photon.\n    3. A heralded \u201centanglement purification\u201d primitive: two SPDC-generated noisy pairs are locally purified using two single-emitter ancilla photons plus linear optics and post-selection.\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1. The entanglement-router is new in the pytheus repertoire (no existing \u201crouting\u201d primitive), uses exactly static SPDC sources + single_emitters + linear optics + heralding, and is a genuine network transformation.\n    2. Controlled-teleportation collapses to a conditional SWAP/teleport gate\u2014not as clean or general as router.\n    3. Purification requires modelling noise and multi-round protocols\u2014beyond Pytheus\u2019s pure-state framework.\n  Step 3: The \u201cquantum entanglement router\u201d is the best: it directly addresses network coding, generalizes to N-destination routing, and cleanly combines weak and strong regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no pytheus experiment so far implements a coherent routing of an SPDC-generated entangled photon by an on-demand emitter qubit\u2014i.e. a true \u201centanglement multiplexer\u201d primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in pytheus because it only needs:\n    \u2022 One SPDC pair_source in the weak-excitation regime  \n    \u2022 One single_photon emitter as the control qubit (strong light\u2013matter coupling)  \n    \u2022 A static linear-optical network mixing three photonic modes (SPDC signal + two rails for the emitter)  \n    \u2022 Four detectors for post-selection (two output nodes + two heralds)  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feedback and no forbidden hyper-entanglement  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target: a quantum entanglement router that uses an on\u2010demand emitter qubit to steer one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of two recipients in superposition.\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to distribute entanglement between a fixed node C and either node A or node B, under the control of an on\u2010demand emitter qubit.  \n\u2013 A weak-excitation SPDC pair_source S creates a Bell pair across modes [S1, C].  \n\u2013 A single\u2010photon emitter E prepares the control qubit in a dual\u2010rail superposition across modes [E0, E1].  \n\u2013 A static linear\u2010optical network interferes the SPDC signal mode S1 with the two emitter rails E0/E1.  \n\u2013 Two of the output modes go to detectors A_out (detectors 0,1) and B_out (2,3) in dual rails; node C always holds its SPDC idler (detectors 4,5).  \n\u2013 Two heralding detectors (6,7) signal successful routing.  \nConditioned on a click on {6,7}, the final photonic state across (E, A_out, B_out, C) is\n  |0\u27e9_E \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,C}  +  |1\u27e9_E \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,C},\ni.e. entanglement between C and A if the emitter was in |0\u27e9, or C and B if in |1\u27e9\u2014in coherent superposition.\n\nVisualization (sources top\u2192bottom):\n  [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E (single_emitter) ]  \n         \u2193                     \u2193  \n       \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510  \n       \u2502    central linear-optical router   \u2502  \n       \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518  \n  Detectors: [0(A0)][1(A1)][2(B0)][3(B1)][4(C0)][5(C1)][6][7(heralds)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"Quantum entanglement router: SPDC\u2010pair directed by on\u2010demand emitter\",\n  foldername:         \"ent_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        30,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            2,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],               # inputs are from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5],     # A_out, B_out, C idler\n  target_quantum: [\n    \"000000\",  # |0>_E |00>_{A,C}\n    \"011000\",  # |0>_E |11>_{A,C}\n    \"100011\",  # |1>_E |00>_{B,C}\n    \"111011\"   # |1>_E |11>_{B,C}\n  ],\n  removed_connections: [\n    # forbid direct SPDC\u2192B and direct emitter\u2192C\n    [2, S_index], [3, S_index],\n    [4, E_index], [5, E_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 It implements a fundamental network\u2010coding primitive\u2014entanglement routing\u2014in a single static circuit.  \n\u2022 Combines weak-excitation SPDC for resource generation with a strong-coupling single emitter for coherent control.  \n\u2022 Can be extended to N-destination routers or cascaded to form reconfigurable quantum repeater networks.  \n\u2022 Purely static linear optics and post\u2010selection; no dynamic feedback or forbidden encodings.  \n\u2022 Opens the door to theory investigations of multiplexer\u2010based entanglement percolation and programmable quantum networks."

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

A hybrid \u201cquantum router\u201d that uses an on-demand emitter qubit to steer one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of two output nodes, thereby routing entanglement in superposition.\n    2. A \u201ccontrolled-teleportation\u201d gate: a single-emitter control photon switches between direct transmission and SPDC-based teleportation of an input photon.\n    3. A heralded \u201centanglement purification\u201d primitive: two SPDC-generated noisy pairs are locally purified using two single-emitter ancilla photons plus linear optics and post-selection.\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1. The entanglement-router is new in the pytheus repertoire (no existing \u201crouting\u201d primitive), uses exactly static SPDC sources + single_emitters + linear optics + heralding, and is a genuine network transformation.\n    2. Controlled-teleportation collapses to a conditional SWAP/teleport gate\u2014not as clean or general as router.\n    3. Purification requires modelling noise and multi-round protocols\u2014beyond Pytheus\u2019s pure-state framework.\n  Step 3: The \u201cquantum entanglement router\u201d is the best: it directly addresses network coding, generalizes to N-destination routing, and cleanly combines weak and strong regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no pytheus experiment so far implements a coherent routing of an SPDC-generated entangled photon by an on-demand emitter qubit\u2014i.e. a true \u201centanglement multiplexer\u201d primitive.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in pytheus because it only needs:\n    \u2022 One SPDC pair_source in the weak-excitation regime  \n    \u2022 One single_photon emitter as the control qubit (strong light\u2013matter coupling)  \n    \u2022 A static linear-optical network mixing three photonic modes (SPDC signal + two rails for the emitter)  \n    \u2022 Four detectors for post-selection (two output nodes + two heralds)  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feedback and no forbidden hyper-entanglement  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target: a quantum entanglement router that uses an on\u2010demand emitter qubit to steer one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of two recipients in superposition.\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to distribute entanglement between a fixed node C and either node A or node B, under the control of an on\u2010demand emitter qubit.  \n\u2013 A weak-excitation SPDC pair_source S creates a Bell pair across modes [S1, C].  \n\u2013 A single\u2010photon emitter E prepares the control qubit in a dual\u2010rail superposition across modes [E0, E1].  \n\u2013 A static linear\u2010optical network interferes the SPDC signal mode S1 with the two emitter rails E0/E1.  \n\u2013 Two of the output modes go to detectors A_out (detectors 0,1) and B_out (2,3) in dual rails; node C always holds its SPDC idler (detectors 4,5).  \n\u2013 Two heralding detectors (6,7) signal successful routing.  \nConditioned on a click on {6,7}, the final photonic state across (E, A_out, B_out, C) is\n  |0\u27e9_E \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,C}  +  |1\u27e9_E \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,C},\ni.e. entanglement between C and A if the emitter was in |0\u27e9, or C and B if in |1\u27e9\u2014in coherent superposition.\n\nVisualization (sources top\u2192bottom):\n  [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E (single_emitter) ]  \n         \u2193                     \u2193  \n       \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510  \n       \u2502    central linear-optical router   \u2502  \n       \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518  \n  Detectors: [0(A0)][1(A1)][2(B0)][3(B1)][4(C0)][5(C1)][6][7(heralds)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"Quantum entanglement router: SPDC\u2010pair directed by on\u2010demand emitter\",\n  foldername:         \"ent_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        30,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            2,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],               # inputs are from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5],     # A_out, B_out, C idler\n  target_quantum: [\n    \"000000\",  # |0>_E |00>_{A,C}\n    \"011000\",  # |0>_E |11>_{A,C}\n    \"100011\",  # |1>_E |00>_{B,C}\n    \"111011\"   # |1>_E |11>_{B,C}\n  ],\n  removed_connections: [\n    # forbid direct SPDC\u2192B and direct emitter\u2192C\n    [2, S_index], [3, S_index],\n    [4, E_index], [5, E_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 It implements a fundamental network\u2010coding primitive\u2014entanglement routing\u2014in a single static circuit.  \n\u2022 Combines weak-excitation SPDC for resource generation with a strong-coupling single emitter for coherent control.  \n\u2022 Can be extended to N-destination routers or cascaded to form reconfigurable quantum repeater networks.  \n\u2022 Purely static linear optics and post\u2010selection; no dynamic feedback or forbidden encodings.  \n\u2022 Opens the door to theory investigations of multiplexer\u2010based entanglement percolation and programmable quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Routing an SPDC link under emitter control has been proposed (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed entanglement router and spectral-control router).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Quantum switch is elegant but again ends up as an entangled state generation of control+output\u2014too close to state generation.\n  Step 3: The quantum butterfly network coding primitive (option 2) is most promising: it is a bona\u2010fide network transformation, novel in pytheus, meets all constraints, and combines both regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because pytheus has never tackled a quantum\u2010network\u2010coding task (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) and it goes beyond simple swapping or teleportation by delivering two qubits across a cross\u2010connected network in one go.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (weak excitation), single\u2010photon emitters (strong coupling), static linear\u2010optical mixing, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no forbidden state-generation prescription.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for pytheus: implement the minimum \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network\u2010coding primitive by \u201ccross\u2010teleporting\u201d two input qubits at nodes A and C onto outputs B and D simultaneously.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe label detectors 0\u20133 as the four logical qubits:  \n  \u2022 0 = A_in  \n  \u2022 1 = C_in  \n  \u2022 2 = B_out  \n  \u2022 3 = D_out  \n\nGoal: Starting from an arbitrary two\u2010qubit input |x\u27e9\u2080|y\u27e9\u2081, the network will deliver |x\u27e9 to output 3 (D_out) and |y\u27e9 to output 2 (B_out) in one static linear-optical circuit.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum.

Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is not in the existing list (which has SPDC\u2010only qutrit swaps or single\u2010emitter qutrit swaps), and Pytheus can handle it (pair_sources + single_emitters + static interferometer + post-selection).  \n  Step 3: Pick (c) as the most promising: it\u2019s a fundamental repeater\u2010link primitive, generalizable to N hops by trading SPDC sources for emitters, and independent of implementation success.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design (or published linear\u2010optical experiment) demonstrates an entanglement swap where one of the two Bell\u2010pairs is generated by two on\u2010demand single\u2010photon emitters, thereby halving the probabilistic\u2010ancilla cost.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because we only require: (i) one SPDC pair_source, (ii) two single_emitters that Pytheus can route and interfere to form a Bell\u2010pair, (iii) a static linear\u2010optical network mixing the three \u201cdata\u201d photons plus two ancilla modes, and (iv) post-selection on two heralding detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or forbidden state-generation.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target for a hybrid entanglement\u2010swap link:\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to entangle node A (detector 0) and node D (detector 1) by swapping two Bell\u2010pairs:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 1 (weak-excitation): an SPDC source S emits two photons into modes [A1, X].  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 2 (strong\u2010coupling): two on-demand single\u2010photon emitters E1, E2 each emit one photon; Pytheus will optimize a small interferometer + post-selection on those two photons to produce a Bell\u2010pair into modes [Y, D1].  \nA single Bell\u2010measurement is then performed on the two \u201cmiddle\u201d photons in modes [X,Y] via a linear\u2010optical mixer and two heralding detectors (2, 3).

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource.

Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements.

By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Programmable Three-Destination Quantum Teleportation to the Choitarget State\n\nAbstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes \u221a\u03b1, \u221a\u03b2, \u221a\u03b3 across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve. By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs. This feed-forward-free certification primitive targets GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell\u2297Bell discrimination in hybrid quantum repeater and memory architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Optical Syndrome Extraction for a 2\u00d72 Toric Code Patch\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive, heralded linear-optical network that non-demolitionally extracts all four Z- and X-type stabilizer syndromes of a minimal 2\u00d72 toric code patch in a single round, explicitly targeting an arbitrary 4-qubit logical state on data ports 0\u20133. Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols.

The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1.

There is no need for feedback control or forbidden encodings.\n  Step 3: This is the most promising: it is a new three\u2010qubit network operation (control + swap inputs \u2192 swapped outputs) that directly combines weak\u2010excitation SPDC and strong\u2010coupling emitters.\n  Step 4: Novel because no previous design lets a control photon choose the swap basis in superposition\u2014opening the door to coherent programmability of network measurements.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: specify one SPDC pair_source, one single_emitter as the control qubit, a static interferometer mixing the two link photons and the control rails, two heralding detectors, and the final 3-qubit target over control + output rails.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nExplanation:\nWe have two SPDC pair sources each creating a Bell pair on modes (A1, A2) and (B1, B2). A single\u2010photon emitter prepares the control qubit |+\u27e9_c in dual\u2010rail modes (C0,C1). A static linear\u2010optical network mixes (A2,B1,C0,C1) so that upon clicks on two herald detectors (modes H0,H1) we have performed:\n  \u2013 a \u03a6\u00b1-basis Bell measurement on (A2,B1) if the control rail C0 clicks,  \n  \u2013 a \u03a8\u00b1-basis Bell measurement on (A2,B1) if the control rail C1 clicks.  \nConditioned on a particular heralding outcome, A1 and B2 end up swapped into either \u03a6+ (control=|0\u27e9) or \u03a8+ (control=|1\u27e9).

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble. Simply adding more control qubits to steer an SPDC link to more outputs is not novel enough for PRL.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Quantum switch is elegant but again ends up as an entangled state generation of control+output\u2014too close to state generation.\n  Step 3: The quantum butterfly network coding primitive (option 2) is most promising: it is a bona\u2010fide network transformation, novel in pytheus, meets all constraints, and combines both regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because pytheus has never tackled a quantum\u2010network\u2010coding task (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) and it goes beyond simple swapping or teleportation by delivering two qubits across a cross\u2010connected network in one go.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (weak excitation), single\u2010photon emitters (strong coupling), static linear\u2010optical mixing, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no forbidden state-generation prescription.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for pytheus: implement the minimum \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network\u2010coding primitive by \u201ccross\u2010teleporting\u201d two input qubits at nodes A and C onto outputs B and D simultaneously.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe label detectors 0\u20133 as the four logical qubits:  \n  \u2022 0 = A_in  \n  \u2022 1 = C_in  \n  \u2022 2 = B_out  \n  \u2022 3 = D_out  \n\nGoal: Starting from an arbitrary two\u2010qubit input |x\u27e9\u2080|y\u27e9\u2081, the network will deliver |x\u27e9 to output 3 (D_out) and |y\u27e9 to output 2 (B_out) in one static linear-optical circuit.

It is not in the existing list (which has SPDC\u2010only qutrit swaps or single\u2010emitter qutrit swaps), and Pytheus can handle it (pair_sources + single_emitters + static interferometer + post-selection).  \n  Step 3: Pick (c) as the most promising: it\u2019s a fundamental repeater\u2010link primitive, generalizable to N hops by trading SPDC sources for emitters, and independent of implementation success.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus design (or published linear\u2010optical experiment) demonstrates an entanglement swap where one of the two Bell\u2010pairs is generated by two on\u2010demand single\u2010photon emitters, thereby halving the probabilistic\u2010ancilla cost.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because we only require: (i) one SPDC pair_source, (ii) two single_emitters that Pytheus can route and interfere to form a Bell\u2010pair, (iii) a static linear\u2010optical network mixing the three \u201cdata\u201d photons plus two ancilla modes, and (iv) post-selection on two heralding detectors\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or forbidden state-generation.  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete Pytheus target for a hybrid entanglement\u2010swap link:\n\nExplanation:\nWe wish to entangle node A (detector 0) and node D (detector 1) by swapping two Bell\u2010pairs:\n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 1 (weak-excitation): an SPDC source S emits two photons into modes [A1, X].  \n  \u2022 Bell\u2010pair 2 (strong\u2010coupling): two on-demand single\u2010photon emitters E1, E2 each emit one photon; Pytheus will optimize a small interferometer + post-selection on those two photons to produce a Bell\u2010pair into modes [Y, D1].  \nA single Bell\u2010measurement is then performed on the two \u201cmiddle\u201d photons in modes [X,Y] via a linear\u2010optical mixer and two heralding detectors (2, 3).

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order.

Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Linear-Optical Nonlocal Analyzer for GHZ\u2084 vs. Bell \u2297 Bell Entanglement Classes\n\nAbstract: We present a static linear-optical network with four ancillary photons and number-resolving detectors that implements a two-outcome POVM to unambiguously certify whether four remote qubits\u2014distributed across mechanical\u2194optical\u2194magnonic nodes\u2014reside in the GHZ\u2084 entanglement class or in the tensor product of two Bell pairs.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Eight ancilla modes\u2014entangled via four probabilistic Bell-pair sources\u2014are measured in four Bell bases whose click-parity outcomes encode the plaquette and star eigenvalues while preserving the target quantum, all within Pytheus\u2019s probabilistic linear-optical framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One\u2010Shot Repetition\u2010Code\u2010Assisted Linear\u2010Optical Teleportation for Passive Phase\u2010Damping Mitigation and QFI Concentration\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We propose a three\u2010node, one\u2010shot linear\u2010optical teleportation network augmented by a three\u2010photon repetition code that passively combats independent phase\u2010damping noise and maximizes the local quantum Fisher information associated with an unknown phase \u03c6. By conditioning on simultaneous triple Bell\u2010state measurement heralds at node B and applying majority\u2010vote decoding at node C, the scheme concentrates the phase coherence of the target qubit state |0\u27e9+e^{i\u03c6}|1\u27e9 onto the output mode C_out without any dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

Quantum switch is elegant but again ends up as an entangled state generation of control+output\u2014too close to state generation.\n  Step 3: The quantum butterfly network coding primitive (option 2) is most promising: it is a bona\u2010fide network transformation, novel in pytheus, meets all constraints, and combines both regimes.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because pytheus has never tackled a quantum\u2010network\u2010coding task (the \u201cbutterfly\u201d network) and it goes beyond simple swapping or teleportation by delivering two qubits across a cross\u2010connected network in one go.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources (weak excitation), single\u2010photon emitters (strong coupling), static linear\u2010optical mixing, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no forbidden state-generation prescription.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for pytheus: implement the minimum \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network\u2010coding primitive by \u201ccross\u2010teleporting\u201d two input qubits at nodes A and C onto outputs B and D simultaneously.  \n\nExplanation:\nWe label detectors 0\u20133 as the four logical qubits:  \n  \u2022 0 = A_in  \n  \u2022 1 = C_in  \n  \u2022 2 = B_out  \n  \u2022 3 = D_out  \n\nGoal: Starting from an arbitrary two\u2010qubit input |x\u27e9\u2080|y\u27e9\u2081, the network will deliver |x\u27e9 to output 3 (D_out) and |y\u27e9 to output 2 (B_out) in one static linear-optical circuit.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Photonic Magic-Square Contextuality Test via Overlapping Bell-Fusions\n\nMini-abstract: We propose an integrated eight-photon experiment on a nanoscale waveguide circuit that implements the Peres\u2013Mermin magic square through four overlapping linear-optics Bell-fusion measurements arranged in a square topology, with enforced adjacency constraints to reveal true contextuality. By post-selecting the four target 8-bit click patterns 11001100, 00110011, 10101010, and 01010101\u2014which satisfy the square\u2019s row/column parity constraints\u2014this scheme directly tests a commuting-observables contextuality scenario inaccessible to concatenated Bell analyses.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns. This heralded W-state projection primitive enables satellite-relayed free-space conference QKD by distributing and measuring genuine three-party W-state correlations for secure conference-key distillation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nNon\u2010Demolition Three-Qubit Majority-Vote Readout of SiV Spin Qubits via Static Linear-Optic Interferometry  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a purely post-selective, linear-optics experiment that implements a non-demolition measurement projecting three remote SiV spin qubits onto the \u201cmajority-0\u201d subspace (target click patterns P\u2080 corresponding to \u22652 spins in |0\u27e9) or onto the \u201cmajority-1\u201d subspace (P\u2081 for \u22652 in |1\u27e9). By entangling each SiV spin with a probabilistic photon emitter, adding an ancilla photon Bell pair, and routing all five modes through an optimized static network of beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, the scheme heralds the three-qubit majority vote without dynamic feed-forward or cavities, enabling distributed consensus primitives and high-order stabilizer checks in a solid-state spin network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Swapping Interferometry for Z\u2082-Flux Detection in a Photonic Square Loop\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nIn the Z\u2082-Flux Entanglement Swapping on a Photonic Square Loop protocol, four probabilistic photon-pair sources are placed on the edges of a square with static phase shifters, and Bell-state measurements at two opposite corners generate two coherent entanglement-swapping paths whose interference amplitude encodes the sum of the four link phases around the loop. By conditionally observing the presence or absence of the swapped Bell pair between the remaining nodes as the total loop phase is tuned between 0 and \u03c0, this experiment provides a direct measurement and topological classification of the Z\u2082 flux via entanglement-swapping interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Three-Node Linear-Optical Violation of the Bilocality Inequality\n\nAbstract: We propose a bilocality-test network in which two independent probabilistic entangled-photon-pair sources feed a static partial Bell-state analyzer at a central node B, while peripheral nodes A and C perform fixed-basis single-qubit measurements conditioned on ancilla-heralded joint outcomes at B. The experiment explicitly targets the conditional A\u2013C correlations\u2014tagged by B\u2019s heralding pattern\u2014to achieve a maximal violation of the bilocality inequality, thereby demonstrating genuine non-bilocal quantum correlations beyond standard two-party Bell tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum.

By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors.

Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical SPA-PT Supermap for Direct Entanglement Negativity and Concurrent CHSH Testing\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a heralded linear-optical supermap that realizes the structural-physical approximation to the partial transpose (SPA-PT)\u2014our target transformation\u2014on one copy of an unknown two-qubit state, producing an output whose fidelity directly yields the state\u2019s entanglement negativity.

A three-mode linear-optics interferometer with photon-number-resolving heralding converts the residual local coherence into nonlocal entanglement between distant output photons A and D, outperforming conventional two-link swapping in the presence of loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Surpassing the repeaterless bound with a photon-number encoded\n  measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: An Analysis of the Completion Time of the BB84 Protocol\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Secret Sharing Enhanced: Utilizing W States for Anonymous and\n  Secure Communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

A hybrid teleportation channel: use two SPDC sources in the weak\u2010excitation regime to perform a Bell\u2010measurement at node A, and use two strongly-coupled single-photon emitters to generate the Bell\u2010pair resource between nodes B and C. Conditioned on the four-photon Bell measurement, an arbitrary qubit at A is teleported to C.\n    2. A repeater\u2010chain entanglement\u2010swapping network: alternate SPDC pair sources (weak excitation) and single-emitter heralded entangling links (strong coupling) to swap entanglement hop-by-hop across a three-node chain, then post-select to entangle the end nodes.\n    3. A three-party coded teleportation/secret-sharing protocol: use SPDC pairs to encode an input qubit into a distributed code across nodes B and C, and single emitters to perform Bell projections for decoding.  \n  Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus\u2010obstacles:\n    1. The teleportation channel is not on the existing list (only swapping and static state generation were done), and it requires no dynamic feedback\u2014just post-selection\u2014so Pytheus can handle it.  \n    2. The repeater\u2010chain is close to entanglement swapping examples but adds heterogeneous sources; Pytheus can mix SPDC + single_emitters, so it\u2019s feasible but less conceptually distinct.  \n    3. The coded teleportation is essentially GHZ/W\u2010state preparation and falls into state generation, which is forbidden.  \n  Step 3: The most promising is idea 1, the hybrid teleportation channel.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no experiment in the existing list implements full qubit teleportation (a nontrivial network transformation) by mixing SPDC sources (weak excitation) for the Bell measurement with single-photon emitters (strong coupling) for the entangled resource.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only static SPDC pair sources, single_emitters, linear interferometers, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic control, no cavities, and it defines an abstract qubit teleportation target (|0\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9 + |1\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9).  \n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a concrete proposal for Pytheus to design a hybrid-regime teleportation network:\n\nExplanation:\nWe want to teleport an unknown qubit at node A (detector 0) to node C (detector 1).  \n\u2013 The Bell measurement at A is implemented by two weak-excitation SPDC pair sources whose photons meet in a small linear-optics network and are post-selected on four ancilla detectors (2,3,4,5).  \n\u2013 The entangled resource between B and C is generated by two on-demand single-photon emitters (strong light\u2013matter coupling), each feeding into modes that are combined interferometrically before reaching detectors at B\u2019s station and C\u2019s output port.  \n\u2013 We enforce that no SPDC source directly populates C and no single-emitter directly populates A by using `removed_connections`.  \n\u2013 Upon coincidence detection in the four ancilla modes, the state at A is teleported to C.  \n  \nVisualization (photons top\u2192bottom):\n  emitters/sources: [SPDC1][SPDC2]   [SE1][SE2]  \n  interferometer :   [  Bell-meas unit  ]   [  resource-prep unit ]  \n  detectors       : [0 (A)] [1 (C)] [2][3][4][5 (ancillas)]  \n  \nConfig for Pytheus:\n{\n  description: \"Hybrid teleportation: SPDC Bell-measurement + single-emitter entangled resource\",\n  foldername: \"hybrid-teleport\",\n  bulk_thr: 0.01,\n  edges_tried: 30,\n  ftol: 1e-06,\n  loss_func: \"cr\",\n  num_anc: 4,\n  optimizer: \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples: 15,\n  in_nodes: [0],\n  out_nodes: [1],\n  target_quantum: [\"00\", \"11\"],\n  single_emitters: [2, 3],           # sources SE1, SE2\n  removed_connections: [              # forbid direct links SPDC\u2192C and SE\u2192A\n    [1, 4], [1, 5], \n    [0, 6], [0, 7]\n  ],\n  number_resolving: true,\n  unicolor: false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Teleportation alone\u2014even using mixed SPDC and single-emitter resources\u2014is not sufficiently novel for a PRL-level network primitive.

It is a true network transformation (routing entanglement), uses only pair_sources + single_emitters + static linear optics + post-selection, and scales to 2\u207f ports.  \n    b) The conditional teleportation has conceptual overlap with controlled-swap/switch examples we tried.  \n    c) The fusion/swap is really just two known primitives chained in one circuit \u2013 essentially state-generation of a 4-photon GHZ-like state.  \n  Step 3: The programmable multi-branch entanglement router (option a) is the winner: it clearly unites weak SPDC pairs and strong-coupling emitters in a scalable network primitive that Pytheus can optimize.  \n  Step 4: Novel because Pytheus has never been tasked with routing the SPDC signal to more than two outputs under coherent emitter control\u2014this opens up a family of 2\u207f-port entanglement-distribution devices.  \n  Step 5: Feasible in Pytheus: one SPDC pair_source produces the Bell pair, n single_emitters provide 2n control rails, a static interferometer mixes the control and signal rails, and 2\u207f heralding detectors post-select successful routing\u2014no dynamic feedback, cavities, or forbidden hyper-entanglement.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus: a programmable 4-branch entanglement router (generalizable to 2\u207f branches) that coherently directs one photon of an SPDC Bell pair to one of four recipients under the control of two on-demand single-photon emitters.\n\nExplanation:\n\u2022 SPDC pair_source S generates a Bell pair in modes (S_sig, S_idl).  \n\u2022 Two single_photon_emitters E1 and E2 each prepare one qubit in dual-rail superposition (control registers C1, C2).  \n\u2022 A fixed linear-optical network interferes the three \u201cdata\u201d modes\u2014S_sig, C1-rails, C2-rails\u2014so that on a successful heralding click at detectors H0,H1,H2,H3 the signal photon emerges in exactly one of four output dual-rail pairs:\n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|00\u27e9 \u2192 output A  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|01\u27e9 \u2192 output B  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|10\u27e9 \u2192 output C  \n   \u2013 if (C1,C2)=|11\u27e9 \u2192 output D  \nMeanwhile the SPDC idler remains at a \u201cstationary\u201d node X.  \nConditioned on the herald, the final joint state across (C1,C2,output-rails,X) is\n  (|00\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{A,X} + |01\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{B,X}\n   + |10\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{C,X} + |11\u27e9_C\u2297|\u03a6\u207a\u27e9_{D,X})/2.\n\nVisualization (top\u2192bottom):\n  Sources:      [ S (pair_source) ]   [ E1 (emitter) ]   [ E2 (emitter) ]  \n  Interferometer:  \u2500\u2500 static multi-input, multi-output mixing network \u2500\u2500  \n  Detectors:    [0(A0)][1(A1)] [2(B0)][3(B1)] [4(C0)][5(C1)] [6(D0)][7(D1)] [8,9,10,11(heralds H0\u2013H3)]\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  description:        \"4-branch entanglement router: SPDC signal steered by 2 emitters\",\n  foldername:         \"4branch_router\",\n  bulk_thr:           0.01,\n  edges_tried:        50,\n  ftol:               1e-06,\n  loss_func:          \"cr\",\n  num_anc:            4,\n  optimizer:          \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  samples:            20,\n  pair_sources:       [S_index],\n  single_emitters:    [E1_index, E2_index],\n  in_nodes:           [],              # no external in_nodes; resources come from sources\n  out_nodes:          [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7],# A, B, C, D dual-rail outputs\n  target_quantum:     [\n    \"11000000\",  # C1C2=00 + A rails 00 + others 0\n    \"11110000\",  #       =00 + A rails 11\n    \"00111100\",  # C1C2=01 + B rails\n    \"00001111\",  # C1C2=10 + C rails\n    \"00000011\"   # C1C2=11 + D rails\n  ],\n  removed_connections:[\n    # forbid SPDC->control rails and control->idler\n    [0,S_index],[1,S_index],[2,S_index],[3,S_index],\n    [8,E1_index],[9,E1_index],[8,E2_index],[9,E2_index]\n  ],\n  number_resolving:   true,\n  unicolor:           false\n}\n\nWhy this is interesting and generalizable:\n\u2022 Introduces the first multi-branch programmable entanglement router as a quantum-network primitive.  \n\u2022 Seamlessly blends a weak-excitation SPDC Bell source with deterministic single-photon emitters for control.  \n\u2022 Purely static optics and post-selection\u2014well within Pytheus\u2019s design space.  \n\u2022 Scales to 2\u207f outputs by adding n emitters and 2\u207f heralds.  \n\u2022 Opens theory directions on resource-scaling of programmable entanglement distribution, network coding, and dynamic network architectures.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The proposed 4-branch entanglement router offers no qualitatively new task beyond the two-destination \u201cmultiplexed entanglement router\u201d and three-destination teleportation router in the ensemble.
