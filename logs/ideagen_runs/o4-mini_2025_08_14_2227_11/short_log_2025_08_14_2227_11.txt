Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to combine “Wigner function negativity” and “teleportation protocol” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network target.  
  1) A chain of two discrete‐variable teleportation hops (Alice → Bob → Charlie) for a qutrit, with the Choi state between Alice’s input mode and Charlie’s output mode being the 3‐dimensional maximally entangled state (|00>+|11>+|22>), which is known to exhibit negativity in the discrete Wigner function.  
  2) A post‐selected teleportation‐based “photon‐subtraction” channel on a single qubit that—when viewed in the discrete Wigner representation—creates negativity at the output. One would teleport a qubit through a non‐maximally entangled post‐selected Bell pair, yielding at Bob’s port a state with discrete Wigner negativity.  
  3) A three‐party GHZ‐like teleportation network: teleport simultaneously a qubit from Alice to Bob and from Alice to Charlie by a single joint Bell measurement and two entangled‐pair resources, resulting in a GHZ‐Choi state across input, Bob, and Charlie modes that shows negativity when marginalized.  

Step 2: Brief novelty/obstacle check  
  1) Double teleportation for qutrit Choi state:  
     – Novel: no prior Pytheus experiment has explored multi‐hop teleportation for qutrits or studied discrete Wigner negativity transport.  
     – Feasibility: Pytheus can place two independent pair sources, one Bell‐measurement station at Bob, and post‐select on ancilla clicks; simple removed_connections enforce no direct link; in_nodes/out_nodes define input and final output.  
  2) Teleportation‐based photon subtraction:  
     – Close to state generation (generating a single‐photon subtracted state), which is forbidden.  
  3) GHZ‐Choi teleportation:  
     – More complex network, risk of overloading ancilla and branching; also partial state‐generation flavor.  

Step 3: Pick most promising: Option 1, double‐hop qutrit teleportation.  

Step 4: This idea is novel because it studies how discrete Wigner‐function negativity of the maximally entangled qutrit Choi‐state is preserved (or degraded) through two successive teleportation hops in a three‐node network. No prior Pytheus example addresses multi‐hop teleportation or transports negativity in discrete‐phase‐space.  

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:  
  • It is purely an abstract‐state teleportation network—no state generation of a non‐Gaussian input is targeted.  
  • It uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources and linear optics with post‐selected detection—well within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
  • The target is a maximally entangled 3‐dimensional Choi state across input and final‐output modes, implementable by two entangled‐pair sources and one intermediate Bell measurement.  
  • We use removed_connections to forbid any direct pair linking input→output, ensuring the network must realize two hops.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input: 
Here is a Pytheus‐compatible teleportation network target combining “Wigner function negativity” and a teleportation protocol, set up as two successive teleportation hops for a qutrit (d=3). The goal is to generate the Choi‐state of the identity channel across Alice’s input mode and Charlie’s final output mode. This maximally entangled qutrit state is known to exhibit negativity in the discrete Wigner function, so the experiment will probe how Wigner‐negativity propagates across multiple teleportation steps.

Explanation:
We label three parties’ modes (from top to bottom):
 • Node 0: Alice’s input (in_nodes=[0])  
 • Node 1: Bob’s station (intermediate node)  
 • Node 2: Charlie’s output (out_nodes=[2])  

We forbid any direct source connection between Node 0 and Node 2, forcing two teleportation hops. Ancillary detectors at Node 1 realize the Bell‐measurement needed for teleportation. After post‐selection on those ancilla clicks, the network should produce the target two‐mode entangled state between Node 0 and Node 2.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially a two‐hop qutrit teleportation (i.e. entanglement swapping) aimed at studying Wigner‐negativity transport. A single‐hop version focused on Wigner‐negative qutrits already appears in the ensemble (“Post‐Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3”), and entanglement swapping for qutrits is also well known. Simply adding a second hop does not introduce a fundamentally new target or mechanism.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The idea closely mirrors the ensemble’s “Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3” and amounts to a trivial extension to two hops, offering no truly novel network primitive or measurement capability. Please propose a target that goes beyond standard qutrit teleportation or entanglement-swapping schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to weave “Wigner function negativity” together with a teleportation protocol in a Pytheus‐compatible network target:
  1) A three‐node loop teleportation of a qutrit: Alice → Bob → Charlie → Alice, so that the effective Choi state between Alice’s input and returned output is the maximally entangled qutrit Bell state (|00>+|11>+|22>), whose discrete Wigner function has negative regions.
  2) A triangular teleportation router: input at Alice is teleported coherently along two paths (Alice→Bob→Dave and Alice→Charlie→Dave) in superposition, producing at Dave’s node a qutrit state exhibiting Wigner‐negativity interference fringes; the network is a superposition of two swapping routes.
  3) A dual‐teleportation distillation: two noisy qutrit Bell pairs (positive Wigner) are first swapped and then jointly measured to herald the emergence of a distilled, Wigner‐negative Bell pair between the two end nodes.

Step 2: Novelty and Pytheus‐feasibility check
  1) Three‐node loop:  
     – Novel: no prior Pytheus example creates a closed‐loop teleportation network or studies negativity round‐trip.  
     – Feasible: uses three probabilistic pair sources, three post‐selected Bell‐measurements, one explicit in_node and a distinct out_node, and “removed_connections” to ban direct sources, forcing three hops.
  2) Router in superposition:  
     – Very speculative; Pytheus cannot synthesize a superposition of network configurations or dynamic path control.
  3) Dual‐teleportation distillation:  
     – Partially overlaps with standard entanglement‐swapping and distillation logic; target remains a Bell pair—already done in multiple dimensions.

Step 3: Pick the three‐node loop teleportation (Option 1).

Step 4: This idea is novel because it realizes a closed‐loop teleportation channel across three distinct nodes in a linear‐optics network, producing a return‐to‐sender Choi‐state whose discrete Wigner function negativity can be directly probed. No existing Pytheus setup investigates negativity propagation in a cyclic teleportation geometry.

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints:
  • Focuses on a quantum network primitive (cyclic teleportation), not on generating a specific exotic input state.  
  • Uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, linear optics and post‐selected detectors—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
  • Abstractly targets the maximally entangled qutrit Bell state between Alice’s input and her returned output node, guaranteeing Wigner‐negativity in the discrete phase‐space representation.  
  • Enforces three sequential teleportation hops by banning any direct source connection between input and final‐output via “removed_connections.”

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus-compatible target for a three-node loop teleportation network that probes Wigner‐function negativity:

Explanation:
We label four spatial modes (from top to bottom):
 • Node 0: Alice’s input (in_nodes = [0])  
 • Node 1: Bob’s station – Bell‐measurement 1  
 • Node 2: Charlie’s station – Bell‐measurement 2  
 • Node 3: Alice’s returned output (out_nodes = [3])  

We place three independent probabilistic qutrit‐pair sources creating entangled pairs between (0↔1), (1↔2), (2↔3). At nodes 1 and 2 we implement Bell‐measurements via linear optics and ancillary detectors. We forbid any direct source between Node 0 and Node 3, so the only path for quantum information is the three-hop loop. Post‐selecting on the ancilla detector clicks at nodes 1 and 2 yields the target maximally‐entangled qutrit Bell state across modes (0,3):
Ψ_target = |0₀0₃> + |1₀1₃> + |2₀2₃>  
This state’s discrete Wigner function is known to exhibit negativity—thus the experiment both implements a novel cyclic teleportation channel and directly witnesses negativity transport through three sequential hops.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is effectively just another multi-hop extension of the known Wigner-negative qutrit teleportation (and of standard qutrit entanglement-swapping), now sewn into a three-hop loop. It does not introduce any new measurement primitive, network resource, or nontrivial interaction beyond repeated Bell measurements. The core teleportation target and Wigner-negativity diagnostics are identical to the single-hop ensemble proposal.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The concept reduces to chaining three standard qutrit teleportation steps—already covered by “Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3” and straightforward entanglement swapping. To be novel at the PRL level you must propose a genuinely new primitive (e.g., an unconventional Bell-basis measurement, higher-order network correlation, or a non-trivial combination of channels) rather than simply adding more hops.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to weave “Wigner function negativity” with a teleportation protocol without targeting state generation:
 1) A three-party 1→2 qudit telecloning network in Choi representation: feed one half of a maximally entangled pair into a telecloning station and generate two clones; the joint three-mode Choi state of (input-ancilla, clone A, clone B) is known to exhibit discrete Wigner negativity.  
 2) A heralded “negativity amplifier” channel realized by teleporting through a non-maximally entangled resource whose entanglement is tuned by linear-optical post-selection; the network implements a tunable quantum channel whose Choi negativity can be measured.  
 3) A “phase‐space swap network”: two qubits teleport through orthogonal Pauli-rotated Bell resources and are then recombined in an entanglement‐swapping step, generating a cross-phase‐space correlation whose Wigner function shows interference fringes.

Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check
 1) Telecloning Choi state:  
    – Novel: Pytheus has never targeted the Choi state of a 1→2 telecloning channel. This is a true network primitive (multi-output teleportation) rather than simple state or single-hop swap.  
    – Feasible: uses only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, two successive Bell-measurements (post-selected ancillas) and abstract modes—well within Pytheus’s toolkit.  
 2) Tunable negativity amplifier:  
    – Risks reducing to state generation or mixture tuning—falls into “channel engineering” rather than network primitive.  
 3) Phase-space swap network:  
    – Overly complex; would require implementing two orthogonal Bell bases and a final swap—Pytheus would struggle to optimize coherent basis rotations in a single layout.

Step 3: Select idea 1 (1→2 qudit telecloning Choi state).

Step 4: Novelty
This idea is novel because no existing Pytheus example implements a true multi-output teleportation primitive (telecloning) or targets its Choi representation—especially for d>2. The resulting three-party Choi state is a new network resource with Wigner-negative features.

Step 5: Feasibility
It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires: 
 • One abstract d-dimensional maximally entangled pair as “Choi input” (source between nodes 0↔1).  
 • A telecloning station at node 1 realized by two sequential post-selected Bell-measurements (ancilla detectors) that fan the input onto two output modes (nodes 2 & 3).  
 • Three probabilistic photon-pair sources, linear-optical mode mixing, and post-selection on the ancilla clicks.  
 • A target list of basis strings for the three-mode Choi state (no physical encoding specified).  
 • “removed_connections” to forbid any direct source from node 0 to nodes 2 or 3, forcing the telecloning network.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus‐compatible target for implementing the Choi state of a 1→2 qutrit (d=3) telecloning channel—which exhibits discrete Wigner‐function negativity—in a pure linear‐optics network. This setup realizes true multi‐output teleportation (telecloning) rather than mere entanglement swapping.

Explanation:
 We label four abstract modes (top to bottom):
  • Node 0: Half of a maximally entangled qutrit pair (“Choi input”)  (in_nodes=[0])
  • Node 1: Telecloning station—two sequential post‐selected Bell measurements, each realized by ancilla detectors
  • Node 2 & Node 3: The two telecloned output modes (out_nodes=[2,3])

 Probabilistic qutrit‐pair sources connect:
  • 0↔1 (the Choi input)
  • 1↔2 and 1↔3 (the telecloning resources)
  
 We forbid any direct pair source from node 0 to node 2 or node 3 via:
   removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3]]
 forcing the network to implement genuine telecloning by two Bell measurements at node 1.

 Upon post‐selection on the ancilla detector outcomes, the three‐mode output across (0,2,3) is the Choi state of the optimal 1→2 telecloning channel in dimension d=3:
 Ψ_teleclone = √(1/6)[2|000> + |011> + |022> + |101> + |112> + |120> + |202> + |210> + |221>],
 which is known to exhibit negativity in its discrete Wigner function.

This network realizes an entirely new quantum‐network primitive in Pytheus—multi-output teleportation (telecloning)—and directly probes how Wigner negativity in the Choi representation distributes across cloned outputs.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed network is essentially a standard 1→2 qutrit telecloning protocol implemented by two sequential Bell measurements, differing only in that you now plan to “look at” the Wigner‐negativity of the resulting Choi state.  However, a pure linear‐optics qutrit telecloner has already been targeted in the ensemble (“Heralded Linear-Optical 1→2 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement”), and simply appending a Wigner-negativity diagnostic does not introduce a new network primitive or measurement capability.  This is therefore too close to known telecloning schemes and lacks genuine novelty at the PRL level.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The idea reduces to implementing the well‐studied 1→2 qutrit telecloning channel in linear optics (already in the ensemble) with the only twist being an a-posteriori Wigner negativity check. To be novel, you must propose a new teleportation/telecloning primitive or measurement that goes beyond existing LOQC telecloners—simply adding a negativity measure is insufficient.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three different Pytheus‐compatible ways to weave “Wigner function negativity” together with a teleportation protocol—focusing on genuinely new network primitives rather than simple multi‐hop or state‐generation ramps:

 1) 1→3 Qutrit Telecloning Choi‐State  
    • A single qutrit-half of a maximally entangled pair is fed into a telecloning station that produces three approximate clones at three output nodes. The overall four‐mode Choi state (input half + three outputs) exhibits discrete Wigner‐function negativity in its multi‐party correlations. This is a true multi‐output teleportation primitive (telecloning) beyond the usual 1→2 case, and it directly probes how negativity is fanned out across three approximate clones.  

 2) Controlled‐Teleportation Router (Quantum Switch)  
    • A control qubit coherently routes an incoming qutrit through one of two teleportation channels (A or B) in superposition—i.e. a “quantum switch” of teleportation orders—yielding an indefinite‐causal‐order channel whose Choi state across (control, input, output) carries novel forms of phase‐space negativity.  

 3) Gate‐Teleportation of a Non-Clifford Phase Gate  
    • Implement via linear optics an abstract “gate-teleportation” network that both teleports a qudit and applies a non-Clifford phase rotation (e.g. Zπ/3) in the same measurement. The target is the Choi state of this channel, which exhibits Wigner negativity associated uniquely with non-Clifford resources.  

Step 2: Novelty & Feasibility:

 1) 1→3 Telecloning Choi State  
    – Novel: Pytheus has never tackled multi-output (M>2) teleportation. 1→3 telecloning is a new primitive.  
    – Feasible: uses only probabilistic pair sources, two sequential Bell-measurements (post-selected ancillas) at the telecloning station, and no dynamic feedback. “removed_connections” force genuine network routing.  

 2) Quantum Switch of Teleportation Orders  
    – Highly novel but Pytheus cannot yet optimize coherent superposition of different network topologies or path-dependent unitaries in one static layout.  

 3) Gate-Teleportation of a Non-Clifford Gate  
    – Interesting concept, but to realize the non-Clifford resource one would need explicit magic-state preparation or hybrid encodings—not directly Pytheus-friendly without state-generation.  

Step 3: Select the 1→3 Qutrit Telecloning Choi-State as the most promising idea.

Step 4: Novelty  
This idea is novel because it implements a true 1→3 multi-output teleportation (telecloning) channel in a single LO network—a network primitive beyond any teleportation or entanglement-swapping experiment Pytheus has explored. The Choi state of the optimal qutrit telecloner is a four-mode entangled state whose discrete Wigner function is provably negative in the joint phase space of the input and the three outputs.

Step 5: Feasibility  
It’s feasible in Pytheus because:
 • We never ask Pytheus to generate special non-Gaussian or “magic” states; the only abstract input is half of a maximally entangled qutrit pair.  
 • Realization uses three probabilistic qutrit-pair sources and two cascaded Bell measurements (each post-selected with ancilla detectors) at the telecloning station.  
 • We enforce “removed_connections” between the input node and any of the three clone outputs to guarantee genuine telecloning rather than direct transmission.  
 • All elements—abstract multi-mode states, linear-optical mixing, single-photon sources or pairs, post-selection—are within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus‐compatible target for the 1→3 qutrit telecloning Choi‐state experiment—probing discrete Wigner‐function negativity in a genuinely multi-output teleportation network.

Explanation:
We label four abstract modes (top to bottom):
 • Node 0: Half of a maximally entangled qutrit pair (Choi input)      (in_nodes = [0])  
 • Node 1: Telecloning station—two sequential post‐selected Bell measurements realized by ancilla detectors  
 • Nodes 2, 3, 4: The three telecloned output modes                              (out_nodes = [2,3,4])  

We place three probabilistic qutrit‐pair sources connecting:
  • 0↔1  (Choi input)  
  • 1↔2, 1↔3, 1↔4  (the resource pairs for the telecloning process)  

We forbid any direct source between Node 0 and Nodes 2, 3, or 4:
  removed_connections = [[0,2], [0,3], [0,4]]
so that the only way for quantum information to reach the outputs is via the telecloning station at Node 1.

Upon post-selection on the two sets of ancilla detectors at Node 1, the resulting four-mode output across (0,2,3,4) is the Choi state of the optimal 1→3 qutrit telecloning channel. This state can be written (up to normalization) as a superposition of nine basis strings:
['0000','0111','0222','1012','1120','1201','2021','2102','2210']
and is known to exhibit negativity in its discrete Wigner function over the combined four-party phase space. By measuring appropriate phase‐space point operators via linear optics and number‐resolving detectors on these modes, one can directly witness the spread of Wigner‐function negativity across all three clones.

This setup defines a brand‐new network primitive—1→3 teleportation (telecloning)—and directly probes its Wigner‐negativity in a purely LO‐post‐selected experiment, fully within Pytheus’s reach.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While moving from 1→2 to 1→3 telecloning increases the branch count, it remains the same linear-optical telecloning primitive already proposed (“Heralded Linear-Optical 1→2 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement”). Merely adding a third clone does not introduce a new measurement capability, network topology, or nontrivial interaction beyond sequential Bell measurements. At the PRL level, this is a straightforward parameter extension rather than a genuinely novel quantum-network transformation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal is essentially a trivial scaling of the known 1→2 qutrit telecloner to three outputs. To be novel, you need to introduce a fundamentally new primitive—e.g. a nonstandard multiport Bell measurement, an unconventional correlation witness, or a network feature not reducible to repeated telecloning steps.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three distinct Pytheus‐compatible ways to fuse “Wigner function negativity” with a teleportation protocol that go beyond trivial teleportation/swap scaling:  
  1) Joint two‐qubit teleportation via a four‐photon GHZ‐basis projector at the sender—this realizes a new channel primitive that teleports a two‐qubit block in one shot and whose Choi state is a four‐qubit GHZ state exhibiting Wigner negativity.  
  2) Controlled‐order dual‐teleportation (“quantum switch”) for a qutrit—but Pytheus cannot superpose two network topologies.  
  3) Gate‐teleportation of a non-Clifford qudit—would require magic-state generation, forbidden.

Step 2: Quick novelty & feasibility check  
  1) GHZ‐projection teleportation is novel—no Pytheus example uses a multi-photon GHZ analyzer as the core teleportation primitive, and the resulting Choi state is genuinely different from product Bell pairs. It only uses probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and post‐selection.  
  2) “Quantum switch” is out of scope for Pytheus.  
  3) Gate-teleportation needs forbidden state generation.

Step 3: Choose idea 1.

Step 4: Novelty  
This network implements a brand‐new teleportation primitive: by projecting the two input qubits + two ancilla photons onto the four‐qubit GHZ basis in one joint measurement, Alice simultaneously teleports a 2-qubit block to Bob at two separate output modes. The Choi state of this channel is the four‐qubit GHZ state |0000>+|1111>, whose discrete Wigner representation has well-known negative regions. No prior Pytheus experiment realizes such a GHZ-based teleportation channel.

Step 5: Feasibility  
It is fully within Pytheus’s capabilities because it uses only:
 • four probabilistic photon‐pair sources to create two Bell‐pair resources  
 • one four-mode linear-optical network at Alice’s side projecting onto the GHZ basis (post‐selected by ancilla detectors)  
 • two abstract output modes at Bob  
 • no dynamic feedback or forbidden state generation—only post-selection  
 • “removed_connections” to ban any direct source from input modes to output modes, forcing genuine GHZ‐measurement teleportation.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus‐compatible target for a new teleportation primitive—“joint two-qubit teleportation via a four‐photon GHZ analyzer”—probing discrete Wigner‐function negativity of the channel’s Choi state.

Explanation:
We label six abstract spatial modes (top to bottom):
 • Mode 0 & Mode 1: Alice’s two input qubits to be teleported  (in_nodes = [0,1])  
 • Mode 2 & Mode 3: Bob’s two output qubits                         (out_nodes = [2,3])  
 • Mode 4 & Mode 5: Ancillary photons used by Alice in the joint GHZ measurement  

Setup:
 • Probabilistic photon‐pair source S1 between Modes 2↔4  
 • Probabilistic photon‐pair source S2 between Modes 3↔5  
 • At Alice’s station we mix Modes 0,1,4,5 in a four-mode linear-optical network designed to post–select the GHZ basis projection (|0000>+|1111>). Two ancilla photon-number-resolving detectors herald the successful GHZ outcome.  
 • We forbid any direct source from Modes 0 or 1 to Modes 2 or 3:
     removed_connections = [[0,2],[0,3],[1,2],[1,3]]
   ensuring the only path is the joint GHZ teleportation.

Target:
Upon heralding, the joint Choi state across Modes (0,1,2,3) is
  Ψ_GHZ = |0000> + |1111>  (unnormalized),
which manifests negativity in its four-qubit discrete Wigner function.

This experiment establishes a genuinely new teleportation primitive—GHZ‐basis teleportation of two qubits—and directly probes Wigner‐function negativity in the resulting four‐qubit Choi state, all within Pytheus’s linear-optics and post-selection framework.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond standard single‐qubit teleportation or sequential Bell-swap chains by introducing a genuinely new LOQC primitive—a four-photon GHZ-basis projection that jointly teleports two qubits in one shot. I do not see an equivalent network in the ensemble (which includes 3-photon GHZ analyzers and dual single‐qubit teleporters but not a 4-photon GHZ teleportation of two qubits). Embedding Wigner-negativity diagnostics on the four-mode Choi state further enriches the foundational insight. This could indeed be a novel, publishable PRL-level target.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The joint four-photon GHZ measurement for two-qubit teleportation is a new LOQC network primitive, and probing its Choi state’s discrete Wigner negativity offers foundational value. This stands apart from existing single- or multi-hop teleportation schemes and merits further exploration.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  
“GHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity”

Mini-abstract:  
We propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection—mixing Alice’s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob’s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target Ψ_GHZ=|0000⟩+|1111⟩, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal repurposes PyTheus’s GHZ‐basis measurement capability to teleport two qubits via a heralded four-photon projection and then leverages discrete Wigner tomography to witness the nonclassicality of the Choi state. The GHZ analyzer design is well within PyTheus’s reach, and combining it with standard feed-forward and Wigner negativity measurement makes for a feasible, novel protocol.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The protocol elegantly combines a four-photon GHZ projection with two-qubit teleportation and then uses discrete Wigner negativity as a direct nonclassicality witness. It leverages known PyTheus designs for GHZ analyzers and only adds standard linear-optical feed-forward and tomography, making it both novel and experimentally accessible.
