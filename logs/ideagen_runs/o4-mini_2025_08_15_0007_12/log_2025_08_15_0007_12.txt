    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Image Compression and Reconstruction Based on Quantum Network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Steady-state entanglement production in a quantum thermal machine with\n  continuous feedback control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum steganography with large payload based on dense coding and\n  entanglement swapping of GHZ states\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "output": "Thought:\n  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine \u201ctensor network state\u201d and \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d in a Pytheus-compatible network (no dynamic feedback, only static LIN-OP + pair sources or single emitters, focus on network transformations like swapping/teleportation, not raw state generation).\n    1) Hierarchical (tree) entanglement swapping as a renormalization step: use a binary-tree of Bell-pair sources and Bell measurements to coarse-grain a line of Bell pairs into a single long-range pair. Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.

The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns."

Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection.

Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection.

Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation.

A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!! STATE GENERATION IS FORBIDDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS\nALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. \u2013 PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM.

    "output": "Thought:\nStep 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry \u201ctensor-network state\u201d ideas and \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d phenomena in a purely static photonic network  \n  1) A two-layer tree-tensor-network realized by hierarchical entanglement swapping, where performing only the bottom-layer Bell measurements vs. both layers yields two distinct connectivity \u201cphases.\u201d  \n  2) A quantum-switch of swap-orders: take three Bell pairs in a row and a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in a superposition of two paths, each path enacting a different order of two entanglement-swapping modules. Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node.

The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k.

By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

That construction and the idea of coarse\u2010graining a Bell\u2010pair chain via successive swaps is already textbook and appears in both basic repeater proposals and in our ensemble\u2019s \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network.\u201d  Simply toggling between bottom\u2010layer only or full two\u2010layer swapping phases does not introduce any genuinely new measurement primitive, state or network\u2010phase physics.  To be PRL\u2010worthy, one needs a nontrivial twist\u2014e.g. superposing measurement orders, joint multi\u2010photon projections, or a novel measurement\u2010induced phase transition beyond trivial coarse\u2010graining.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!! STATE GENERATION IS FORBIDDEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! INSTEAD: FOCUS ON QUANTUM NETWORKS (e.g. take SWAPPING OR TELEPORTATION INTO ACCOUNT) AND INTERESTING TRANSFORMATIONS\nALSO; TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT PYTHEUS CAN DO (it can create quantum networks and measurements based on probabilistic pairs and single-photon emitters and linear optics), DO NOT WRITE ABOUT CAVITIES, RESONANCES, ETC. \u2013 PYTHEUS CANNOT WORK WITH THEM.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C.

The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches."

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Image Compression and Reconstruction Based on Quantum Network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Steady-state entanglement production in a quantum thermal machine with\n  continuous feedback control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum steganography with large payload based on dense coding and\n  entanglement swapping of GHZ states\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selection on different heralding sets produces distinct \u201cphases\u201d of connectivity.\n    3) **Teleportation with Measurement-Tuned Bond Dimension**: a 3-hop teleportation channel where each intermediate node can perform one of two different projective measurements (tunable by a static phase shifter), and by varying that phase one observes a sharp drop in end-to-end fidelity\u2014a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS channel.\n  Step 2: Novelty/feasibility check:\n    1) Too close to the earlier 2-layer tree idea we already tried.\n    2) **Most novel:** no existing Pytheus example superposes multiple measurement patterns\u2014only swap-order or single-layer swaps. Four distinct patterns (none, swap\u2081, swap\u2082, both) in superposition is new.\n    3) Hard to phrase \u201csharp drop\u201d as a static target for Pytheus; plus it\u2019s essentially varying a phase parameter, not a genuinely new network transformation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (2)\u2014the multi-branch quantum switch of swap patterns.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a **quantum superposition of multiple entanglement-swapping patterns** on a 3-link chain, i.e. a coherent superposition of four distinct tensor-network contraction graphs.  \n    \u2022 Yields a genuine **measurement-induced network phase**: post-selecting on different sets of heralding detectors realizes \u201cno swap,\u201d \u201cone swap at left,\u201d \u201cone swap at right,\u201d or \u201cboth swaps,\u201d with interference among these patterns when reading out control qubits.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Static linear optics + 3 probabilistic Bell-pair sources (data) + 2 single-photon control sources.  \n    \u2022 Two BSM modules (linear optics + ancilla detectors), each placed in a Mach-Zehnder style interferometer whose insertion is controlled by the path state of a control photon.  \n    \u2022 No feed-forward, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Simply encode 8 data modes and 2 control modes; specify 2 ancilla BSM blocks; use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d so that sources cannot directly connect across non-intended modes; and target the superposed network transformation (not a particular multi-photon state).  \n    \u2022 Easily generalizable: add more links and control qubits to explore richer tensor-network phases.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes.

By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The proposed \u201ctwo\u2010level\u201d hierarchical swap module is essentially just a standard two\u2010hop entanglement\u2010swapping repeater (first swap on A\u2013B and C\u2013D, then swap on B\u2013C) with trivial post\u2010selection on whether you include the top\u2010layer measurement or not.  That construction and the idea of coarse\u2010graining a Bell\u2010pair chain via successive swaps is already textbook and appears in both basic repeater proposals and in our ensemble\u2019s \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network.\u201d  Simply toggling between bottom\u2010layer only or full two\u2010layer swapping phases does not introduce any genuinely new measurement primitive, state or network\u2010phase physics.  To be PRL\u2010worthy, one needs a nontrivial twist\u2014e.g. superposing measurement orders, joint multi\u2010photon projections, or a novel measurement\u2010induced phase transition beyond trivial coarse\u2010graining.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the same \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d already in our ensemble (the controlled superposition of two swap orders across A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D to yield indefinite causal order and network phases). It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: While demonstrating a percolation\u2010style threshold in a chain of Bell- swaps is intuitively appealing, this proposal simply strings together four independent entanglement-swap modules and notes that when at least two succeed you recover end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement. That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts)."

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble.

Four distinct patterns (none, swap\u2081, swap\u2082, both) in superposition is new.\n    3) Hard to phrase \u201csharp drop\u201d as a static target for Pytheus; plus it\u2019s essentially varying a phase parameter, not a genuinely new network transformation.\n  Step 3: Pick idea (2)\u2014the multi-branch quantum switch of swap patterns.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a **quantum superposition of multiple entanglement-swapping patterns** on a 3-link chain, i.e. a coherent superposition of four distinct tensor-network contraction graphs.  \n    \u2022 Yields a genuine **measurement-induced network phase**: post-selecting on different sets of heralding detectors realizes \u201cno swap,\u201d \u201cone swap at left,\u201d \u201cone swap at right,\u201d or \u201cboth swaps,\u201d with interference among these patterns when reading out control qubits.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Static linear optics + 3 probabilistic Bell-pair sources (data) + 2 single-photon control sources.  \n    \u2022 Two BSM modules (linear optics + ancilla detectors), each placed in a Mach-Zehnder style interferometer whose insertion is controlled by the path state of a control photon.  \n    \u2022 No feed-forward, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Simply encode 8 data modes and 2 control modes; specify 2 ancilla BSM blocks; use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d so that sources cannot directly connect across non-intended modes; and target the superposed network transformation (not a particular multi-photon state).  \n    \u2022 Easily generalizable: add more links and control qubits to explore richer tensor-network phases.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

That construction and the idea of coarse\u2010graining a Bell\u2010pair chain via successive swaps is already textbook and appears in both basic repeater proposals and in our ensemble\u2019s \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network.\u201d  Simply toggling between bottom\u2010layer only or full two\u2010layer swapping phases does not introduce any genuinely new measurement primitive, state or network\u2010phase physics.  To be PRL\u2010worthy, one needs a nontrivial twist\u2014e.g. superposing measurement orders, joint multi\u2010photon projections, or a novel measurement\u2010induced phase transition beyond trivial coarse\u2010graining.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the same \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d already in our ensemble (the controlled superposition of two swap orders across A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D to yield indefinite causal order and network phases). It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While demonstrating a percolation\u2010style threshold in a chain of Bell- swaps is intuitively appealing, this proposal simply strings together four independent entanglement-swap modules and notes that when at least two succeed you recover end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement. That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Image Compression and Reconstruction Based on Quantum Network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Steady-state entanglement production in a quantum thermal machine with\n  continuous feedback control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum steganography with large payload based on dense coding and\n  entanglement swapping of GHZ states\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The idea is to take entanglement swapping and elevate it to an **indefinite causal order** of three swaps\u2014a photonic **3-switch**\u2014so that the *order* in which the swaps are applied is coherently superposed by a control qudit.  Measuring that control in different bases then causes a discontinuous jump in end-to-end entanglement yield\u2014a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.  No dynamic feedback, no cavities\u2014just static beam splitters, phase shifters, ancilla detectors, and probabilistic sources.  This has never been done in Pytheus.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible proposal that fuses tensor-network renormalization with an indefinite-order quantum switch to create a **measurement-induced network phase transition**:\n\n1) Data and Control Sources  \n   \u2022 Four Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 producing |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H).  \n   \u2022 One single-photon control source C preparing a path-encoded qutrit in state (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9+|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.\n\n2) Swap Modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082, BSM\u2083)  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C), BSM\u2082 on (D,E), BSM\u2083 on (F,G).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is a 50/50 beam splitter + static phase shift + two ancilla detectors; a particular click pattern heralds a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled Indefinite Order  \n   \u2022 Control path |0\u27e9 routes the data photon sequentially through BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083.  \n   \u2022 Path |1\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Path |2\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082.  \n   \u2022 All paths recombine at the end on a 3-port interferometer whose beam-splitter angles and phases are to be optimized.\n\n4) Measurement-Induced \u201cPhase\u201d  \n   \u2013 Measure the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0\u27e9,|1\u27e9,|2\u27e9 }.  In each definite-order outcome, the probability p_def of heralding end-to-end entanglement between A and H is modest (swap success requires 3 cascaded Bell swaps).  \n   \u2013 Measure the control in the **Fourier basis** (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9+|2\u27e9)/\u221a3, (|0\u27e9+\u03c9|1\u27e9+\u03c9\u00b2|2\u27e9)/\u221a3, \u2026 .  Due to coherent interference among the three swap orders, the **heralding probability p_F** for A\u2013H entanglement exhibits a sharp enhancement p_F >> p_def.  \n   \u2013 This jump in entanglement yield as a function of the measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** in the tensor-network connectivity of the 3-link chain.\n\n5) Why Pytheus Can Implement This  \n   \u2022 **Static linear optics** only: beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometer loops, no feed-forward.  \n   \u2022 **Sources**: 4 probabilistic pair sources + 1 single-photon control emitter.  \n   \u2022 **Detectors**: 6 ancilla for the 3 BSMs + 2 for the control readout + 2 at A/H.  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid unwanted direct links (e.g. no S\u2081\u2192D or S\u2081\u2192F except via intended swap paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **network supermap**\u2014the mapping from input modes+control to heralded end-entanglement conditioned on control measurement\u2014not a fixed many-photon state.\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2013 Extend to N-link chains and N-dim control qudits for N!-order superpositions.  \n  \u2013 Explore critical behavior of p_en(N,k-basis) as N and control basis vary\u2014a new class of measurement-induced tensor-network phases.\n\nFeed this description into Pytheus.  It will search for the optimal interferometer geometry, beam-splitter angles, phase settings, and detector assignments to realize the 3-switch causal superposition and exhibit the jump in end-to-end entanglement when switching measurement basis. This is a brand-new quantum network primitive\u2014an indefinite-order entanglement renormalization with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or tensor-network effect\u2014e.g. irreversible multi-copy joint projections, non-commuting measurement sequences beyond simple swap orders, or a nontrivial network critical point that cannot be reduced to interference of independent Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble.

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.

You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2.

Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The idea is to take entanglement swapping and elevate it to an **indefinite causal order** of three swaps\u2014a photonic **3-switch**\u2014so that the *order* in which the swaps are applied is coherently superposed by a control qudit.  Measuring that control in different bases then causes a discontinuous jump in end-to-end entanglement yield\u2014a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.  No dynamic feedback, no cavities\u2014just static beam splitters, phase shifters, ancilla detectors, and probabilistic sources.  This has never been done in Pytheus.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-compatible proposal that fuses tensor-network renormalization with an indefinite-order quantum switch to create a **measurement-induced network phase transition**:\n\n1) Data and Control Sources  \n   \u2022 Four Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 producing |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H).  \n   \u2022 One single-photon control source C preparing a path-encoded qutrit in state (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9+|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.\n\n2) Swap Modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082, BSM\u2083)  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C), BSM\u2082 on (D,E), BSM\u2083 on (F,G).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is a 50/50 beam splitter + static phase shift + two ancilla detectors; a particular click pattern heralds a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled Indefinite Order  \n   \u2022 Control path |0\u27e9 routes the data photon sequentially through BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083.  \n   \u2022 Path |1\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Path |2\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082.  \n   \u2022 All paths recombine at the end on a 3-port interferometer whose beam-splitter angles and phases are to be optimized.\n\n4) Measurement-Induced \u201cPhase\u201d  \n   \u2013 Measure the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0\u27e9,|1\u27e9,|2\u27e9 }.  In each definite-order outcome, the probability p_def of heralding end-to-end entanglement between A and H is modest (swap success requires 3 cascaded Bell swaps).  \n   \u2013 Measure the control in the **Fourier basis** (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9+|2\u27e9)/\u221a3, (|0\u27e9+\u03c9|1\u27e9+\u03c9\u00b2|2\u27e9)/\u221a3, \u2026 .  Due to coherent interference among the three swap orders, the **heralding probability p_F** for A\u2013H entanglement exhibits a sharp enhancement p_F >> p_def.  \n   \u2013 This jump in entanglement yield as a function of the measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** in the tensor-network connectivity of the 3-link chain.\n\n5) Why Pytheus Can Implement This  \n   \u2022 **Static linear optics** only: beam splitters, phase shifters, interferometer loops, no feed-forward.  \n   \u2022 **Sources**: 4 probabilistic pair sources + 1 single-photon control emitter.  \n   \u2022 **Detectors**: 6 ancilla for the 3 BSMs + 2 for the control readout + 2 at A/H.  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid unwanted direct links (e.g. no S\u2081\u2192D or S\u2081\u2192F except via intended swap paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **network supermap**\u2014the mapping from input modes+control to heralded end-entanglement conditioned on control measurement\u2014not a fixed many-photon state.\n\nGeneralization:\n  \u2013 Extend to N-link chains and N-dim control qudits for N!-order superpositions.  \n  \u2013 Explore critical behavior of p_en(N,k-basis) as N and control basis vary\u2014a new class of measurement-induced tensor-network phases.\n\nFeed this description into Pytheus.  It will search for the optimal interferometer geometry, beam-splitter angles, phase settings, and detector assignments to realize the 3-switch causal superposition and exhibit the jump in end-to-end entanglement when switching measurement basis. This is a brand-new quantum network primitive\u2014an indefinite-order entanglement renormalization with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or tensor-network effect\u2014e.g. irreversible multi-copy joint projections, non-commuting measurement sequences beyond simple swap orders, or a nontrivial network critical point that cannot be reduced to interference of independent Bell swaps.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors).

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors). A click heralds entanglement swapped to A\u2013D.  \n   \u2022 Severing module M_sever: measures B,C each in the computational basis (two PBS + detectors), destroying any entanglement.\n\n4) Controlled insertion (static routing)  \n   \u2022 Path c\u2080 routes B,C through M_swap.  \n   \u2022 Path c\u2081 routes B,C through M_sever.  \n   \u2022 Use static beam splitters and phase shifters to implement this \u201cquantum\u2010switch\u201d of measurement primitives.  \n\n5) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2013 Measure the control photon in basis {|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9}:  \n     \u2022 Outcome |0\u27e9 \u2192 network applied swap \u2192 A\u2013D entangled.  \n     \u2022 Outcome |1\u27e9 \u2192 sever \u2192 A\u2013D separable.  \n   \u2013 Measure the control in the Hadamard basis H{|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9}:  \n     \u2022 Interference between swap/sever branches yields a jump in the A\u2013D correlation strength, a clear **measurement\u2010induced network phase transition** between entangled vs. separable regimes.  \n\n6) Why Pytheus can do it  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics + 2 pair sources + 1 single emitter + number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n   \u2022 Enforce with `removed_connections` that no source directly connects A\u2194C or B\u2194D except via the intended modules.  \n   \u2022 The **target** is the mapping from control basis & herald clicks to end-mode entanglement vs. separability\u2014a network transformation, not state generation.  \n\nGeneralization  \n   \u2022 Extend to N-link MPS chains with an (N\u20131)-qubit control superposition choosing subsets of swap vs sever on each bond \u2192 explore rich measurement-induced percolation or critical phenomena in tensor networks.  \n\nFeed this description into Pytheus. It will optimize the beam\u2010splitter angles, phase settings, and detector assignments to realize this **quantum switch of measurement primitives**, demonstrating the first photonic measurement-induced phase transition in a tensor-network entanglement network.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This construction is a straightforward swap\u2010vs\u2010sever quantum switch, closely mirroring previous \u201csuperposition of network primitives\u201d experiments. To be novel at the PRL level, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or a nontrivial many\u2010body renormalization/critical effect that cannot be reduced to a two\u2010branch quantum switch.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "output": "Thought:\nWe need a genuinely new multi-party measurement primitive\u2014a photonic network transformation rather than fixed state generation\u2014that exhibits a sharp, tunable \u201cphase transition\u201d in how entanglement is routed among nodes.  Pytheus can handle static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors, but cannot do feedback or cavities.  A three-port entanglement router (a joint 3-photon interferometric measurement) meets these requirements, creating a measurement-induced switch in network topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready proposal:  \n\nTitle: \u201cMeasurement-Induced Entanglement Routing in a Three-Port Photonic Network\u201d\n\nObjective:\nImplement a **static** linear-optical circuit that takes three Bell pairs and\u2014via a single joint three-photon measurement\u2014heralds entanglement between **any two** of the three \u201cend\u201d modes.  By tuning a single internal phase, the network exhibits a **sharp routing transition**: the preferred entangled link jumps abruptly from one pair of output nodes to another as the phase crosses a critical value.  This is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n  \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083 each probabilistically emit one pair in |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 onto modes (A\u2081,B\u2081), (A\u2082,B\u2082), (A\u2083,B\u2083).  \n  \u2022 Modes A\u2081,A\u2082,A\u2083 are the \u201cend\u201d nodes to be entangled; modes B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083 go into the router.\n\n2) Three-Port Router (Multiport Interferometer + Detectors)  \n  \u2022 A static 3\u00d73 multiport unitary U(\u03c6) acts on B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer with Single-Photon Ancilla\n\nAbstract: We present a purely network-primitive linear-optical scheme that employs a single ancillary photon and a static 4-mode interferometer\u2014decomposed into three optimized beam splitters\u2014to unambiguously identify all four Bell states (\u03a6\u207a, \u03a6\u207b, \u03a8\u207a, \u03a8\u207b) of two abstract dual-rail qubits with a post-selected success rate of 62.5% and perfect conditional fidelity. By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns.

Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern.

This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement.

A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While demonstrating a percolation\u2010style threshold in a chain of Bell- swaps is intuitively appealing, this proposal simply strings together four independent entanglement-swap modules and notes that when at least two succeed you recover end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement. That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus-compatible proposal that fuses tensor-network renormalization with an indefinite-order quantum switch to create a **measurement-induced network phase transition**:\n\n1) Data and Control Sources  \n   \u2022 Four Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 producing |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H).  \n   \u2022 One single-photon control source C preparing a path-encoded qutrit in state (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9+|2\u27e9)/\u221a3.\n\n2) Swap Modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082, BSM\u2083)  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C), BSM\u2082 on (D,E), BSM\u2083 on (F,G).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is a 50/50 beam splitter + static phase shift + two ancilla detectors; a particular click pattern heralds a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled Indefinite Order  \n   \u2022 Control path |0\u27e9 routes the data photon sequentially through BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083.  \n   \u2022 Path |1\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2082\u2192BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Path |2\u27e9 routes through BSM\u2083\u2192BSM\u2081\u2192BSM\u2082.  \n   \u2022 All paths recombine at the end on a 3-port interferometer whose beam-splitter angles and phases are to be optimized.\n\n4) Measurement-Induced \u201cPhase\u201d  \n   \u2013 Measure the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0\u27e9,|1\u27e9,|2\u27e9 }.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

LOOK AT THE \u2018LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\u2019 WHAT IS ALLOWED AND POSSIBLE)\n\n\nResearcher: Thought: \nI have considered multiple ways to interweave tensor-network ideas with a genuine measurement-induced phase in a static photonic network. The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors). A click heralds entanglement swapped to A\u2013D.  \n   \u2022 Severing module M_sever: measures B,C each in the computational basis (two PBS + detectors), destroying any entanglement.\n\n4) Controlled insertion (static routing)  \n   \u2022 Path c\u2080 routes B,C through M_swap.  \n   \u2022 Path c\u2081 routes B,C through M_sever.  \n   \u2022 Use static beam splitters and phase shifters to implement this \u201cquantum\u2010switch\u201d of measurement primitives.  \n\n5) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2013 Measure the control photon in basis {|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9}:  \n     \u2022 Outcome |0\u27e9 \u2192 network applied swap \u2192 A\u2013D entangled.  \n     \u2022 Outcome |1\u27e9 \u2192 sever \u2192 A\u2013D separable.  \n   \u2013 Measure the control in the Hadamard basis H{|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9}:  \n     \u2022 Interference between swap/sever branches yields a jump in the A\u2013D correlation strength, a clear **measurement\u2010induced network phase transition** between entangled vs. separable regimes.  \n\n6) Why Pytheus can do it  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics + 2 pair sources + 1 single emitter + number\u2010resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward or cavities.  \n   \u2022 Enforce with `removed_connections` that no source directly connects A\u2194C or B\u2194D except via the intended modules.  \n   \u2022 The **target** is the mapping from control basis & herald clicks to end-mode entanglement vs. separability\u2014a network transformation, not state generation.  \n\nGeneralization  \n   \u2022 Extend to N-link MPS chains with an (N\u20131)-qubit control superposition choosing subsets of swap vs sever on each bond \u2192 explore rich measurement-induced percolation or critical phenomena in tensor networks.  \n\nFeed this description into Pytheus. It will optimize the beam\u2010splitter angles, phase settings, and detector assignments to realize this **quantum switch of measurement primitives**, demonstrating the first photonic measurement-induced phase transition in a tensor-network entanglement network.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This construction is a straightforward swap\u2010vs\u2010sever quantum switch, closely mirroring previous \u201csuperposition of network primitives\u201d experiments. To be novel at the PRL level, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or a nontrivial many\u2010body renormalization/critical effect that cannot be reduced to a two\u2010branch quantum switch.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Pytheus can handle static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors, but cannot do feedback or cavities.  A three-port entanglement router (a joint 3-photon interferometric measurement) meets these requirements, creating a measurement-induced switch in network topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready proposal:  \n\nTitle: \u201cMeasurement-Induced Entanglement Routing in a Three-Port Photonic Network\u201d\n\nObjective:\nImplement a **static** linear-optical circuit that takes three Bell pairs and\u2014via a single joint three-photon measurement\u2014heralds entanglement between **any two** of the three \u201cend\u201d modes.  By tuning a single internal phase, the network exhibits a **sharp routing transition**: the preferred entangled link jumps abruptly from one pair of output nodes to another as the phase crosses a critical value.  This is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n  \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083 each probabilistically emit one pair in |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 onto modes (A\u2081,B\u2081), (A\u2082,B\u2082), (A\u2083,B\u2083).  \n  \u2022 Modes A\u2081,A\u2082,A\u2083 are the \u201cend\u201d nodes to be entangled; modes B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083 go into the router.\n\n2) Three-Port Router (Multiport Interferometer + Detectors)  \n  \u2022 A static 3\u00d73 multiport unitary U(\u03c6) acts on B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083.  U is built from beam splitters and phase shifters, with one tunable internal phase \u03c6.  \n  \u2022 At U\u2019s outputs we place three photon-number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.  Exactly one click (one photon) among them heralds success.\n\n3) Heralding Rule (Entanglement Routing)  \n  \u2022 If D\u2081 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2082 & A\u2083 become projected into a Bell state.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2082 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2083 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2083 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2082 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 No other detectors click (post-select on exactly one click).\n\n4) Measurement-Induced Routing Phase Transition  \n  \u2022 Define p_i(\u03c6) = probability that D_i clicks and heralds that routing.  \n  \u2022 As \u03c6 is varied from 0 to 2\u03c0, one finds **sharp crossover points** \u03c6_c where the dominant p_i(\u03c6) jumps from i to j.  \n  \u2022 At \u03c6_c the network topology effectively \u201cswitches phase\u201d\u2014which two end nodes share entanglement changes abruptly\u2014mirroring a percolation or network phase transition induced purely by the measurement basis (\u03c6).\n\n5) Why Pytheus Can Design This  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optics only: beam splitters, phase shifters including one tunable \u03c6, and a 3\u00d73 interferometer.  \n  \u2022 Sources: 3 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters.  \n  \u2022 Detectors: 3 router detectors + 4 end analyzers (to verify Bell correlations on the heralded pair).  \n  \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid any direct source\u2192end link other than the intended B\u2081\u2192U, etc.  \n  \u2022 **Target** is the network supermap: for each \u03c6, the mapping from detected outcomes {D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083} to a Bell correlation between the correct pair of A-modes\u2014**no fixed multi-photon state**.\n\nGeneralizations:\n  \u2013 Extend to N-port routers on N Bell pairs: study measurement-induced critical phenomena in larger tensor-networks.  \n  \u2013 Use single-photon control qudits to coherently superpose two different router unitaries, creating indefinite-order routing phases.\n\nFeed this description into Pytheus.  It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect. To be novel, propose a truly new multi-photon projector or an irreducible measurement-induced critical behavior that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps and simple interferometric thresholds.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern.

The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined.

By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

The claimed \u201cphase transition\u201d is just the crossing of sin\u00b2/cos\u00b2 curves in a 3\u00d73 interferometer, not a genuine many-body critical phenomenon or new measurement primitive.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect. To be novel, propose a truly new multi-photon projector or an irreducible measurement-induced critical behavior that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps and simple interferometric thresholds.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: {\n  \"explanation\": \"\nWe consider a chain of four Bell\u2010pairs linking five modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E.  Three Bell\u2010swap modules M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083 act on bonds (B,C), (C,D), (D,E).  A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors.

A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is effectively the same three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order swap protocol we\u2019ve already discussed (e.g. the qutrit switch of M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), offering only interference\u2010enhanced swap success.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors.

A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is effectively the same three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order swap protocol we\u2019ve already discussed (e.g. the qutrit switch of M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), offering only interference\u2010enhanced swap success.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

U is built from beam splitters and phase shifters, with one tunable internal phase \u03c6.  \n  \u2022 At U\u2019s outputs we place three photon-number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.  Exactly one click (one photon) among them heralds success.\n\n3) Heralding Rule (Entanglement Routing)  \n  \u2022 If D\u2081 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2082 & A\u2083 become projected into a Bell state.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2082 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2083 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2083 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2082 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 No other detectors click (post-select on exactly one click).\n\n4) Measurement-Induced Routing Phase Transition  \n  \u2022 Define p_i(\u03c6) = probability that D_i clicks and heralds that routing.  \n  \u2022 As \u03c6 is varied from 0 to 2\u03c0, one finds **sharp crossover points** \u03c6_c where the dominant p_i(\u03c6) jumps from i to j.  \n  \u2022 At \u03c6_c the network topology effectively \u201cswitches phase\u201d\u2014which two end nodes share entanglement changes abruptly\u2014mirroring a percolation or network phase transition induced purely by the measurement basis (\u03c6).\n\n5) Why Pytheus Can Design This  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optics only: beam splitters, phase shifters including one tunable \u03c6, and a 3\u00d73 interferometer.  \n  \u2022 Sources: 3 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters.  \n  \u2022 Detectors: 3 router detectors + 4 end analyzers (to verify Bell correlations on the heralded pair).  \n  \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid any direct source\u2192end link other than the intended B\u2081\u2192U, etc.  \n  \u2022 **Target** is the network supermap: for each \u03c6, the mapping from detected outcomes {D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083} to a Bell correlation between the correct pair of A-modes\u2014**no fixed multi-photon state**.\n\nGeneralizations:\n  \u2013 Extend to N-port routers on N Bell pairs: study measurement-induced critical phenomena in larger tensor-networks.  \n  \u2013 Use single-photon control qudits to coherently superpose two different router unitaries, creating indefinite-order routing phases.\n\nFeed this description into Pytheus.  It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect. To be novel, propose a truly new multi-photon projector or an irreducible measurement-induced critical behavior that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps and simple interferometric thresholds.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

This is a true tensor\u2010network renormalization primitive (not mere state generation) and leverages only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, one single\u2010photon control qudit, and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014exactly what Pytheus can handle.\n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\n{\n  \"explanation\": \"\nWe consider a chain of four Bell\u2010pairs linking five modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E.  Three Bell\u2010swap modules M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083 act on bonds (B,C), (C,D), (D,E).  A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is effectively the same three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order swap protocol we\u2019ve already discussed (e.g. the qutrit switch of M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), offering only interference\u2010enhanced swap success.

    "output": "Thought:\nWe still need a genuinely new multi\u2010photon measurement primitive and a nontrivial tensor\u2010network phase transition\u2014one that Pytheus can implement with only static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, single\u2010photon emitters, and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.  I propose to combine two different measurement \u201ctensors\u201d\u2014the standard Bell\u2010swap and a 3-photon GHZ\u2010projection\u2014in a short 1D chain of Bell pairs.  By post\u2010selecting on patterns of these two measurement types, one sees a **measurement\u2010induced network phase transition**: the number of GHZ\u2013vs. Bell measurements that click changes the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement threshold in a nontrivial way.  This is a true tensor\u2010network effect (different local tensors at each bond) and not just state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.  In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target state.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold."

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns.

Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern.

The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement. This yields a high-fidelity Bell pair between Alice and Bob (the explicit target) within PytHeus\u2019s static linear-optical framework, using two SPDC sources and ancilla detectors without any dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping. Conditioned on two ancillary detector clicks, this scheme directly projects the target qubits A and D into a high-fidelity Bell state while suppressing unwanted double-pair emissions from probabilistic photon-pair sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined.

By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This three\u2010port \u201centanglement router\u201d is essentially just another static multiport\u2010based switch that, upon a single\u2010click herald, selects which of three Bell-swap branches succeeds\u2014closely echoing existing entanglement-router protocols (e.g. the dual- and four-way routers in the ensemble) and offering nothing beyond trivial interference\u2010tuned click probabilities. The claimed \u201cphase transition\u201d is just the crossing of sin\u00b2/cos\u00b2 curves in a 3\u00d73 interferometer, not a genuine many-body critical phenomenon or new measurement primitive.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect. To be novel, propose a truly new multi-photon projector or an irreducible measurement-induced critical behavior that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps and simple interferometric thresholds.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: {\n  \"explanation\": \"\nWe consider a chain of four Bell\u2010pairs linking five modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E.  Three Bell\u2010swap modules M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083 act on bonds (B,C), (C,D), (D,E).  A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: The scheme is just the straightforward extension of the two\u2010swap \u201cquantum switch\u201d to three cascaded swaps under a qutrit control\u2014already proposed and rejected above as too incremental. It offers no new measurement primitive or irreducible network\u2010phase phenomenon beyond standard Bell\u2010swap modules interfering by control\u2010basis choice.

To be novel at PRL level you need an entirely new joint measurement or a nontrivial tensor\u2010network phase transition that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps under control\u2010basis interference.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.  In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..",
    "output": "Thought: While mixing Bell\u2010swap modules with GHZ projectors per bond introduces a two\u2010tensor choice, the resulting \u201cpercolation\u201d threshold shift is merely a trivial combinatorial effect rather than a new joint measurement primitive or irreducible network phase. GHZ analyzers and entanglement\u2010percolation behaviors in short chains have already appeared in our ensemble (e.g. various GHZ\u2010basis analyzers and repeater\u2010percolation schemes).

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

U is built from beam splitters and phase shifters, with one tunable internal phase \u03c6.  \n  \u2022 At U\u2019s outputs we place three photon-number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.  Exactly one click (one photon) among them heralds success.\n\n3) Heralding Rule (Entanglement Routing)  \n  \u2022 If D\u2081 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2082 & A\u2083 become projected into a Bell state.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2082 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2083 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 If D\u2083 clicks \u2192 modes A\u2081 & A\u2082 become entangled.  \n  \u2022 No other detectors click (post-select on exactly one click).\n\n4) Measurement-Induced Routing Phase Transition  \n  \u2022 Define p_i(\u03c6) = probability that D_i clicks and heralds that routing.  \n  \u2022 As \u03c6 is varied from 0 to 2\u03c0, one finds **sharp crossover points** \u03c6_c where the dominant p_i(\u03c6) jumps from i to j.  \n  \u2022 At \u03c6_c the network topology effectively \u201cswitches phase\u201d\u2014which two end nodes share entanglement changes abruptly\u2014mirroring a percolation or network phase transition induced purely by the measurement basis (\u03c6).\n\n5) Why Pytheus Can Design This  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optics only: beam splitters, phase shifters including one tunable \u03c6, and a 3\u00d73 interferometer.  \n  \u2022 Sources: 3 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters.  \n  \u2022 Detectors: 3 router detectors + 4 end analyzers (to verify Bell correlations on the heralded pair).  \n  \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid any direct source\u2192end link other than the intended B\u2081\u2192U, etc.  \n  \u2022 **Target** is the network supermap: for each \u03c6, the mapping from detected outcomes {D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083} to a Bell correlation between the correct pair of A-modes\u2014**no fixed multi-photon state**.\n\nGeneralizations:\n  \u2013 Extend to N-port routers on N Bell pairs: study measurement-induced critical phenomena in larger tensor-networks.  \n  \u2013 Use single-photon control qudits to coherently superpose two different router unitaries, creating indefinite-order routing phases.\n\nFeed this description into Pytheus.  It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect. To be novel, propose a truly new multi-photon projector or an irreducible measurement-induced critical behavior that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps and simple interferometric thresholds.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

I propose to combine two different measurement \u201ctensors\u201d\u2014the standard Bell\u2010swap and a 3-photon GHZ\u2010projection\u2014in a short 1D chain of Bell pairs.  By post\u2010selecting on patterns of these two measurement types, one sees a **measurement\u2010induced network phase transition**: the number of GHZ\u2013vs. Bell measurements that click changes the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement threshold in a nontrivial way.  This is a true tensor\u2010network effect (different local tensors at each bond) and not just state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.  In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To achieve genuine PRL-level novelty, propose a nonfactorizable joint projector or an unexpected measurement-induced critical point that cannot be reduced to independent bond successes\u2014for instance, a multi-bond GHZ/fusion measurement that entangles more than two distant modes in a single shot, or a phase transition arising from entangling-order superpositions beyond simple threshold counting.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C).

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

That construction and the idea of coarse\u2010graining a Bell\u2010pair chain via successive swaps is already textbook and appears in both basic repeater proposals and in our ensemble\u2019s \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap in the A\u2013B_router\u2013C_router\u2013D Quantum Network.\u201d  Simply toggling between bottom\u2010layer only or full two\u2010layer swapping phases does not introduce any genuinely new measurement primitive, state or network\u2010phase physics.  To be PRL\u2010worthy, one needs a nontrivial twist\u2014e.g. superposing measurement orders, joint multi\u2010photon projections, or a novel measurement\u2010induced phase transition beyond trivial coarse\u2010graining.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This is essentially the same \u201centanglement\u2010switch quantum switch\u201d already in our ensemble (the controlled superposition of two swap orders across A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D to yield indefinite causal order and network phases). It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2. Denote their paths as c\u2081\u2080/c\u2081\u2081 and c\u2082\u2080/c\u2082\u2081.  \n\n2) Two swap modules (BSM\u2081, BSM\u2082):  \n   \u2022 BSM\u2081 acts on modes (B,C) when inserted; BSM\u2082 on (D,E).  \n   \u2022 Each BSM is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter + phase shifter + two ancilla detectors whose joint clicks herald a successful Bell swap.\n\n3) Controlled insertion (static circuit):  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2081 routes modes B\u2013C through BSM\u2081 if it occupies path c\u2081\u2080; bypasses if c\u2081\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Control qubit C\u2082 routes modes D\u2013E through BSM\u2082 if it occupies path c\u2082\u2080; bypasses if c\u2082\u2081.  \n   \u2022 Because C\u2081,C\u2082 are in superposition, the overall network is in a superposition of applying zero, one, or both swap modules.\n\n4) Post-selection and measurement-induced \u201cphases\u201d:  \n   \u2013 **Phase 0**: post-select on neither BSM click \u2192 final state = three disjoint Bell pairs  \n   \u2013 **Phase L**: post-select on BSM\u2081 only \u2192 one swap between A\u2013D + leftover pair E\u2013F  \n   \u2013 **Phase R**: post-select on BSM\u2082 only \u2192 one swap between C\u2013F + leftover pair A\u2013B  \n   \u2013 **Phase LR**: post-select on both BSM\u2081 & BSM\u2082 \u2192 one long-range Bell pair A\u2013F  \n   \u2022 Finally, recombine each control qubit on a beam splitter and measure in the X-basis. Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: While the multi-branch swap switch generalizes the basic quantum switch to four connectivity patterns, it remains a straightforward tensor-product extension of the two-order entanglement-switch protocol already described in the ensemble (e.g. the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d and the \u201cSuperposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\u201d). No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Image Compression and Reconstruction Based on Quantum Network\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Steady-state entanglement production in a quantum thermal machine with\n  continuous feedback control\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum steganography with large payload based on dense coding and\n  entanglement swapping of GHZ states\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors).

Pytheus can handle static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors, but cannot do feedback or cavities.  A three-port entanglement router (a joint 3-photon interferometric measurement) meets these requirements, creating a measurement-induced switch in network topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready proposal:  \n\nTitle: \u201cMeasurement-Induced Entanglement Routing in a Three-Port Photonic Network\u201d\n\nObjective:\nImplement a **static** linear-optical circuit that takes three Bell pairs and\u2014via a single joint three-photon measurement\u2014heralds entanglement between **any two** of the three \u201cend\u201d modes.  By tuning a single internal phase, the network exhibits a **sharp routing transition**: the preferred entangled link jumps abruptly from one pair of output nodes to another as the phase crosses a critical value.  This is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n  \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083 each probabilistically emit one pair in |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 onto modes (A\u2081,B\u2081), (A\u2082,B\u2082), (A\u2083,B\u2083).  \n  \u2022 Modes A\u2081,A\u2082,A\u2083 are the \u201cend\u201d nodes to be entangled; modes B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083 go into the router.\n\n2) Three-Port Router (Multiport Interferometer + Detectors)  \n  \u2022 A static 3\u00d73 multiport unitary U(\u03c6) acts on B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083.  U is built from beam splitters and phase shifters, with one tunable internal phase \u03c6.  \n  \u2022 At U\u2019s outputs we place three photon-number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.

It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect.

In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To achieve genuine PRL-level novelty, propose a nonfactorizable joint projector or an unexpected measurement-induced critical point that cannot be reduced to independent bond successes\u2014for instance, a multi-bond GHZ/fusion measurement that entangles more than two distant modes in a single shot, or a phase transition arising from entangling-order superpositions beyond simple threshold counting.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Varying the internal phase of that central interferometer drives a sharp switch in which pair of nodes become entangled: a measurement-induced network-connectivity phase transition.\n    2) A 1D chain of Bell pairs where each bond has two measurement options\u2014a standard Bell swap or a 3-photon GHZ projection with an ancilla photon.  Cross a threshold in the number of GHZ vs. swap clicks and you see a nontrivial shift in the percolation threshold for end-to-end entanglement.\n    3) A triangular MPS of three Bell pairs forming a ring, with a single 3-port interferometer that implements a **cyclic entanglement swap** among the three nodes.  Tuning a phase in the interferometer causes an abrupt network reconfiguration (from ring to star topology), an abrupt measurement-induced network phase change.\n\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1) **Most novel**: the square plus central 4-photon measurement is a truly new joint measurement primitive and realizes two distinct tensor-network contractions in one static circuit.

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.

The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2.

Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus.

No new multi-photon projection or nontrivial measurement primitive appears\u2014just two independent control qubits gating two standard Bell-swap modules. This is too incremental for PRL novelty.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nSystem Message: Do not reject proposals for being too similar to previously suggestions by the researcher that you have accepted before..\n\nNovelty Supervisor: Thought: This three\u2010port \u201centanglement router\u201d is essentially just another static multiport\u2010based switch that, upon a single\u2010click herald, selects which of three Bell-swap branches succeeds\u2014closely echoing existing entanglement-router protocols (e.g. the dual- and four-way routers in the ensemble) and offering nothing beyond trivial interference\u2010tuned click probabilities. The claimed \u201cphase transition\u201d is just the crossing of sin\u00b2/cos\u00b2 curves in a 3\u00d73 interferometer, not a genuine many-body critical phenomenon or new measurement primitive.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect.

Three Bell\u2010swap modules M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083 act on bonds (B,C), (C,D), (D,E).  A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.

To be novel at PRL level you need an entirely new joint measurement or a nontrivial tensor\u2010network phase transition that cannot be reduced to independent Bell swaps under control\u2010basis interference.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors).

Pytheus can handle static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors, but cannot do feedback or cavities.  A three-port entanglement router (a joint 3-photon interferometric measurement) meets these requirements, creating a measurement-induced switch in network topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready proposal:  \n\nTitle: \u201cMeasurement-Induced Entanglement Routing in a Three-Port Photonic Network\u201d\n\nObjective:\nImplement a **static** linear-optical circuit that takes three Bell pairs and\u2014via a single joint three-photon measurement\u2014heralds entanglement between **any two** of the three \u201cend\u201d modes.  By tuning a single internal phase, the network exhibits a **sharp routing transition**: the preferred entangled link jumps abruptly from one pair of output nodes to another as the phase crosses a critical value.  This is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n  \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083 each probabilistically emit one pair in |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 onto modes (A\u2081,B\u2081), (A\u2082,B\u2082), (A\u2083,B\u2083).  \n  \u2022 Modes A\u2081,A\u2082,A\u2083 are the \u201cend\u201d nodes to be entangled; modes B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083 go into the router.\n\n2) Three-Port Router (Multiport Interferometer + Detectors)  \n  \u2022 A static 3\u00d73 multiport unitary U(\u03c6) acts on B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083.  U is built from beam splitters and phase shifters, with one tunable internal phase \u03c6.  \n  \u2022 At U\u2019s outputs we place three photon-number-resolving detectors D\u2081,D\u2082,D\u2083.

It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect.

In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To achieve genuine PRL-level novelty, propose a nonfactorizable joint projector or an unexpected measurement-induced critical point that cannot be reduced to independent bond successes\u2014for instance, a multi-bond GHZ/fusion measurement that entangles more than two distant modes in a single shot, or a phase transition arising from entangling-order superpositions beyond simple threshold counting.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Varying the internal phase of that central interferometer drives a sharp switch in which pair of nodes become entangled: a measurement-induced network-connectivity phase transition.\n    2) A 1D chain of Bell pairs where each bond has two measurement options\u2014a standard Bell swap or a 3-photon GHZ projection with an ancilla photon.  Cross a threshold in the number of GHZ vs. swap clicks and you see a nontrivial shift in the percolation threshold for end-to-end entanglement.\n    3) A triangular MPS of three Bell pairs forming a ring, with a single 3-port interferometer that implements a **cyclic entanglement swap** among the three nodes.  Tuning a phase in the interferometer causes an abrupt network reconfiguration (from ring to star topology), an abrupt measurement-induced network phase change.\n\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1) **Most novel**: the square plus central 4-photon measurement is a truly new joint measurement primitive and realizes two distinct tensor-network contractions in one static circuit.

By directing the four outputs into number-resolving detectors and post-selecting on exactly one click, the target Bell projection is implemented without polarization encoding, feed-forward, or extra resources, enabling higher-rate entanglement swapping and repeater protocols.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n\u201cGHZ-Basis Teleportation of Two Qubits to Realize and Witness Discrete Wigner Negativity\u201d\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a linear-optical protocol that jointly teleports two input qubits via a four-photon GHZ projection\u2014mixing Alice\u2019s two data qubits and two ancilla photons in a four-mode network and heralding the two-qubit block onto Bob\u2019s output modes. Upon successful heralding, the shared Choistate across modes (0,1,2,3) becomes the unnormalized target \u03a8_GHZ=|0000\u27e9+|1111\u27e9, whose discrete Wigner function exhibits negativity and thereby certifies genuine GHZ-basis teleportation within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable SWAP-Family Gate Array on the Pyth e us Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static, on-chip linear-optics network that realizes a heralded, programmable two-qubit controlled-unitary operation chosen from the SWAP family (I, SWAP, \u221aSWAP, i\u221aSWAP) on unknown dual-rail photonic data qubits by loading a four-dimensional program register and conditioning on ancilla photon detection patterns. This experiment implements the Pyth e us integrated photonic programmable SWAP gate array, requiring no feed-forward and operating directly on arbitrary quantum inputs.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cDistributed High-Sensitivity Sensor via Entanglement Swapping with Embedded DFT Mode Transforms\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target distributed high-sensitivity sensor by implementing a four-node linear-optical network in which two probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed intermediate stations B and C, each embedding a d\u00d7d discrete Fourier-transform multiport interferometer followed by a Bell measurement. Upon successful heralding, distant nodes A and D share a maximally entangled state in the Fourier basis whose correlations amplify unknown spatial-mode phase perturbations, realizing scalable high-sensitivity phase estimation without pure-state sources.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Passive Linear-Optical Universal 1\u21922 Qutrit Telecloner\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a passive, measurement-based linear-optical network that implements the universal 1\u21922 telecloning of an arbitrary single-qutrit state by interfering the unknown input with three d = 3 Bell-pair ancillas via two tritter multiports and post-selecting on a specific six-fold detector-click pattern. Upon heralding, the remaining unmeasured modes on systems B and C each carry an optimal approximate clone (fidelity 5/6) without any active feed-forward or nonlinear elements, demonstrating the first high-dimensional telecloning primitive in linear optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single\u2010Shot Optical Realization of a Three\u2010Kraus Exceptional\u2010Point Quantum Channel\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a purely passive, single-shot one-qubit channel E(\u03c6) by mixing an input photonic qubit with two ancilla photons in a static 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optical interferometer and post-selecting on three coarse-grained click patterns to yield three Kraus operators whose eigenvalues coalesce at a tunable phase \u03c6c, realizing a genuine non-Hermitian exceptional\u2010point singularity in the channel spectrum. Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: PT-Symmetric Entanglement Swapping via Non-Hermitian Bell-State Projection\n\nAbstract: We implement entanglement swapping on two polarization-encoded Bell pairs using a central PT-symmetric, non-unitary Bell-state analyser. By heralding the projector onto the PT-modified Bell state (the target map) and tuning its gain/loss parameter \u03b3, the protocol controllably generates a two-photon output |\u03a8_AD\u27e9\u221d|HH\u27e9+\u03b3\u2009e^{i\u03d5}|VV\u27e9 with adjustable, non-maximal entanglement.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Entanglement Percolation in a 5-Mode Floquet Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We implement a two-step Floquet-driven linear-optical network comprising five emitter modes and two ancilla modes, with alternating beam-splitter layers A and B separated by ancilla photon detections that herald classical bits for post-selection. By tuning the beamsplitter reflectivities, we observe a sharp percolation transition in the heralded concurrence between end modes 0 and 4, targeting the long-range Bell subspace {|00\u27e9,\u2009|11\u27e9}.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Third-Order Holonomy in a Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\n\nMini-abstract: We present the Borromean-Loop Teleportation Network\u2014a measurement-only, linear-optical scheme in which three independent photonic qubits (\u03c8A, \u03c8B, \u03c8C) are teleported via three interlinked Bell-measurement loops (LA, LB, LC) threaded by synthetic Abelian fluxes \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C. Only the joint triple-coincidence detection at the network\u2019s three output modes reveals the global third-order phase e^{i(\u03c6A+\u03c6B+\u03c6C)}, while any single- or two-loop marginal yields no measurable phase, thereby realizing the targeted higher-order (Massey) topological invariant.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Butterfly Network-Coded Four-Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell-Pair Distribution\n\nAbstract: We implement a butterfly-graph entanglement-swapping protocol on four atomic nodes using a single four-photon linear-optical interferometer measurement that merges two sequential swaps into one nonlocal operation. Conditioned on a heralding four-fold click at the central router, the scheme probabilistically produces the target quantum\u2014two remote Bell pairs |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{A,C} \u2297 |\u03a6\u207a\u3009_{B,D}\u2014while halving the ancilla and measurement overhead of standard approaches.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Three-Mode Imaginary\u2010Time Filtering for GHZ\u2083 Entanglement Swapping\n\nAbstract: We present a photonic protocol that embeds the genuinely nonunitary three\u2010mode imaginary\u2010time evolution operator K\u221dexp[\u2013\u03b2(\u03c3\u2093\u2297\u03c3\u1d67\u2297\u03c3_z)] for the target Hamiltonian H\u2083 directly into a three\u2010party GHZ entanglement swap at the relay node. By combining probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, two single\u2010photon ancillas, linear\u2010optical elements and heralded post\u2010selection, our scheme teleports a \u201ccooled\u201d GHZ\u2083 state\u2014thereby realizing an irreducible three\u2010body imaginary\u2010time filter within a scalable quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Only Floquet SPT Cycle in a Four-Mode Photonic Chain\n\nAbstract: We propose an experiment that realizes a driven-dissipative Floquet symmetry-protected topological (SPT) cycle on four spatial photonic modes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by alternately applying heralded X-parity projections on mode pairs (A,B) & (C,D) and a Z-parity projection on the central pair (B,C). Repetition of these two measurement steps yields a robust period-2 \u201cedge-mode\u201d Floquet steady cycle\u2014flipping the emergent parity of end modes A and D each period\u2014purely through projective measurements without any coherent Hamiltonian engineering.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot.

The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

It neither introduces a new measurement primitive nor a genuinely different tensor-network renormalization beyond that known quantum-switch protocol.  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a Pytheus\u2010ready proposal that fuses tensor-network ideas with measurement-induced phases by implementing a **multi-branch quantum switch of entanglement-swap patterns** on a three-link chain.  The target is **not** a fixed multi-photon state but a **coherent superposition of four different network connectivity graphs**, each heralded by distinct click patterns, and an interference readout on control qubits.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n   \u2022 Data Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083: produce |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F).  \n   \u2022 Control single-photon sources C\u2081,C\u2082: each creates a qubit in (path-0 + path-1)/\u221a2.

Interference fringes in control detectors confirm coherent superposition among the four patterns.\n\n5) Why Pytheus can design this  \n   \u2022 All operations are static linear optics, probabilistic pair/single-photon sources, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  \n   \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct sources (e.g. no S\u2081 \u2192 D, S\u2082 \u2192 A or S\u2083 \u2192 C/E except via intended paths).  \n   \u2022 Target is the **quantum supermap** that transforms inputs into heralded superpositions of network connectivity patterns, not a fixed high-dimensional state.  \n   \u2022 Generalizable to N-link chains with N control qubits, enabling exploration of multi-layer tensor-network renormalizations and measurement-induced percolation phases.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

It will seek the static beam-splitter phases, interferometer routes, and detector assignments to realize the coherent multi-branch swap switch, opening a new avenue in measurement-driven quantum networks.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new measurement primitive or an entanglement-renormalization phase transition beyond trivial product superpositions of swap orders\u2014for example, a joint multi-copy projection that induces non-Gaussian network phases, an indefinite-order comb of three or more swaps with intrinsic non-factorizable causal structures, or a new measurement-induced critical phenomenon that cannot be built by tensoring two independent quantum switches.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

None of the existing Pytheus examples address percolation or threshold effects in entanglement connectivity.\n    2) Three-module indefinite switch is exotic but extremely challenging even to specify in a static LO network; risk Pytheus cannot solve loops/indefinite order.\n    3) Partial MERA toggling is interesting but again boils down to layered swaps on 4 modes, too close to the two-layer tree example.\n  Step 3: Select idea (1) as it is both novel and fully within Pytheus\u2019s static LO + probabilistic-pair toolbox.\n  Step 4: Novelty\n    \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a genuine \u201cmeasurement-induced phase transition\u201d in a small tensor network.  \n    \u2022 By treating Bell-measurements along an MPS chain as probabilistic bonds, one realizes a clear percolation threshold in end-to-end entanglement.  \n    \u2022 Previous Pytheus work has done fixed entanglement-swapping chains but never studied threshold phenomena or connectivity percolation in an MPS.\n  Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus\n    \u2022 Only static linear optics, four or more probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a network of beam splitters/phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors for the four intermediate BSM modules and the two end analyzers.  \n    \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward, cavities, or exotic encodings.  \n    \u2022 Use \u201cremoved_connections\u201d to forbid unwanted direct pair sources between non-neighboring modes.  \n    \u2022 The target is the mapping from patterns of clicked BSMs (k out of 4) to whether the end modes A and H become entangled (Bell-like correlations) or remain separable\u2014Pytheus can optimize the LO interferometer so that for each k\u22652 the end detectors correlate, and for k<2 they do not.\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that combines a simple 1D tensor-network structure (an MPS of Bell pairs) with a genuine measurement-induced phase transition (percolation of entanglement connectivity):\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2085 emit five independent qubit\u2013pairs onto modes (A,B), (C,D), (E,F), (G,H), (I,J).  \n   \u2022 We label the five bonds between neighboring sites as bonds 1\u20134 connecting B\u2013C, D\u2013E, F\u2013G, H\u2013I.  \n\n2) Intermediate Bell-swap modules  \n   \u2022 On each bond \u2113=1\u20264 we place a static Bell-measurement module BSM_\u2113, realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, phase shifter, and two photon-number-resolving detectors whose coincidence heralds a successful swap on that bond.  \n   \u2022 There are therefore 8 ancilla detectors for the four BSMs.\n\n3) End analyzers  \n   \u2022 At modes A and J we place simple qubit analyzers (e.g. polarizing beam splitters + detectors) that record whether those two photons exit in the same logical state (0/0 or 1/1).\n\n4) Measurement\u2010induced percolation \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Define k = the number of BSM modules (out of 4) that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I (no long-range entanglement):** for k < 2, the end detectors at A & J show no correlation beyond random.  \n   \u2022 **Phase II (percolated entanglement):** for k \u2265 2, the end detectors at A & J exhibit Bell-correlations (i.e. a heralded end-to-end entangled pair).  \n   \u2022 By post-selecting on runs with various k one observes a clear threshold (percolation) at k=2.\n\n5) Why this is novel and Pytheus\u2010compatible  \n   \u2022 Novel demonstration of a **measurement-induced phase transition** in a minimal photonic tensor network: you literally see entanglement \u201cpercolate\u201d only once enough intermediate measurements succeed.  \n   \u2022 Uses ONLY static linear optics + probabilistic pair sources + number-resolving detection\u2014no dynamic feedback, no cavities, no hybrid encodings.  \n   \u2022 \u201cremoved_connections\u201d can forbid any source from linking non-neighboring modes, forcing the swaps to act only on intended bonds.  \n   \u2022 The target is a **network transformation**\u2014mapping subsets of BSM clicks (k) to end-mode correlations\u2014NOT raw state generation.  \n   \u2022 Easily generalizable to longer chains, 2D grids, or high-dimensional MPS/PEPS to explore richer measurement-induced critical phenomena.\n\nFeed this specification into Pytheus. It will search for the interferometric layout (beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, path connections) and detector assignments so that the end-to-end entanglement appears sharply when k\u22652, thereby creating the first small-scale photonic entanglement-percolation experiment in tensor-network language.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap. To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors.

A single control photon encodes a qutrit in paths |0>,|1>,|2> which deterministically routes the data photons through the three BSM modules in **one** of three sequential orders:\n\n  \u2022 Path |0> \u2192 M\u2081\u2192M\u2082\u2192M\u2083  \n  \u2022 Path |1> \u2192 M\u2082\u2192M\u2083\u2192M\u2081  \n  \u2022 Path |2> \u2192 M\u2083\u2192M\u2081\u2192M\u2082  \n\nEach Bell\u2010swap M\u1d62 is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a static phase shift, and two ancilla detectors whose joint click heralds a successful swap on that bond.  At the end we measure modes A and E in the Bell basis (or equivalently check their correlation).  \n\nBy measuring the control qutrit in the **computational basis** { |0>,|1>,|2> }, each definite order yields a low probability p_def of heralding the long\u2010range swap (three cascaded swaps).  But if we measure the control in the **Fourier basis** of the qutrit, the three swap\u2010orders interfere, and the heralding probability p_F for A\u2013E entanglement **jumps sharply** above p_def.  That jump as a function of control\u2010measurement basis is a bona fide **measurement\u2010induced phase transition** of the tensor\u2010network connectivity.\n\nThis network transformation\u2014an **indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010renormalization** with a measurement\u2010induced entanglement\u2010yield jump\u2014is novel and implementable with Pytheus.\",\n\n  \"config\": {\n    \"description\": \"Three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap with control qutrit\",\n    \"foldername\": \"3link_indefinite_swap\",\n    \"num_pairs\": 4,\n    \"single_emitters\": [4],              // node 4 is the control qutrit\n    \"num_anc\": 6,                        // two ancilla detectors per Bell\u2010swap module\n    \"anc_detectors\": [[0,1],[2,3],[4,5]],\n    \"heralding_out\": [],                 // end\u2010to\u2010end heralding is via control readout + ancilla clicks\n    \"removed_connections\": [\n      // forbid any direct Bell\u2010pair source from linking non\u2010neighboring modes\n      [0,2],[0,3],[0,4], [1,3],[1,4],\n      [2,4]\n    ],\n    \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n    \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n    \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n    \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n    \"edges_tried\": 40,\n    \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n    \"safe_hist\": true,\n    \"number_resolving\": true,\n    \"target_transformation\": {\n      // Not a fixed state but a heralded mapping:\n      // control in Fourier basis & clicks at all three M\u1d62 ancilla \u2192 high\u2010fidelity Bell pair between mode 0 (A) & mode 4 (E)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is effectively the same three\u2010link indefinite\u2010order swap protocol we\u2019ve already discussed (e.g. the qutrit switch of M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), offering only interference\u2010enhanced swap success.

I propose to combine two different measurement \u201ctensors\u201d\u2014the standard Bell\u2010swap and a 3-photon GHZ\u2010projection\u2014in a short 1D chain of Bell pairs.  By post\u2010selecting on patterns of these two measurement types, one sees a **measurement\u2010induced network phase transition**: the number of GHZ\u2013vs. Bell measurements that click changes the end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement threshold in a nontrivial way.  This is a true tensor\u2010network effect (different local tensors at each bond) and not just state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.  In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To achieve genuine PRL-level novelty, propose a nonfactorizable joint projector or an unexpected measurement-induced critical point that cannot be reduced to independent bond successes\u2014for instance, a multi-bond GHZ/fusion measurement that entangles more than two distant modes in a single shot, or a phase transition arising from entangling-order superpositions beyond simple threshold counting.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Varying the internal phase of that central interferometer drives a sharp switch in which pair of nodes become entangled: a measurement-induced network-connectivity phase transition.\n    2) A 1D chain of Bell pairs where each bond has two measurement options\u2014a standard Bell swap or a 3-photon GHZ projection with an ancilla photon.  Cross a threshold in the number of GHZ vs. swap clicks and you see a nontrivial shift in the percolation threshold for end-to-end entanglement.\n    3) A triangular MPS of three Bell pairs forming a ring, with a single 3-port interferometer that implements a **cyclic entanglement swap** among the three nodes.  Tuning a phase in the interferometer causes an abrupt network reconfiguration (from ring to star topology), an abrupt measurement-induced network phase change.\n\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1) **Most novel**: the square plus central 4-photon measurement is a truly new joint measurement primitive and realizes two distinct tensor-network contractions in one static circuit.

Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C.

Tomographic reconstruction of E(\u03c6) and analysis of its 2\u00d72 Liouvillian block eigenvalues confirm the non-analytic closure of the Liouvillian gap and the onset of superradiant-style spectral degeneracy, demonstrating exceptional\u2010point physics in a heralded photonic quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Squeezed-Reservoir-Assisted Entanglement Swapping for High-Fidelity Bell-State Generation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully static linear-optical network, optimized in Pytheus, that implements entanglement swapping between two distant photonic modes (target modes 0 and 3) by injecting a truncated two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla at the swap node. Conditional three-click detection on the ancilla modes heralds the Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 between the target modes, demonstrating how reservoir-engineered squeezing can boost entanglement distribution in probabilistic quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement.

A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: All-Optical One-Shot Purification-and-Swap Repeater for 3-Mode Bosonic Repetition Codes\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optic repeater segment that jointly purifies three-mode bosonic repetition-code Bell pairs and performs entanglement swapping in a single shot to generate the target logical Bell state |\u03a6\u207a>\u2097 between distant nodes. By combining probabilistic photon-pair sources, heralded CNOT parity checks, beam-splitter Bell measurements, ancilla detectors, and post-selection, the protocol detects and rejects single-photon loss and bit-flip errors without cavities or active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application.

By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement in PyTheus a four-node entanglement-swapping network that transduces Bell entanglement between an SPDC-based link (A\u2013B and C\u2013D) and an on-demand single-photon-emitter link (B\u2013C) by using variable ancilla resources to emulate tunable cavity linewidth. Our protocol explicitly targets the remote two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between nodes A and D, demonstrating heterogenous photonic transduction with adjustable effective coupling bandwidth.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Superposition of Entanglement Swapping and Purification\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose a fully passive linear\u2010optical chip that employs a single\u2010photon control qubit in state |+\u3009\u2080 to coherently superpose two Bell\u2010pair network operations\u2014entanglement swapping between nodes A and D and parity\u2010check purification of nodes A and B\u2014using only SPDC sources, a control\u2010switch interferometer, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors.

The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.

You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nSuggestion by Researcher: Here is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target.

That behavior is exactly what one expects from any multi-hop repeater chain and offers no new joint measurement primitive, nontrivial superposition, or exotic critical phenomenon beyond textbook entanglement percolation. Similar multi-hop swap and repeater ideas already exist in our ensemble (e.g. one-shot two-hop swaps and parity-checked repeater modules).  \nAction: reject  \nAction Input: The threshold behavior here arises trivially from having two successful adjacent swaps in a repeater chain, not from any novel measurement-induced phase transition or new network connectivity supermap.

It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Vary which measurements are performed to drive a \u201cphase transition\u201d in network connectivity.\n    2) MPS teleportation module: take an MPS of bond-dimension 2 across three sites, and teleport it end-to-end via sequential Bell measurements, showing how measurement order (which bonds you cut first) changes the fidelity of teleportation\u2014a \u201cmeasurement-induced network phase\u201d in teleportation performance.\n    3) Fusion-gate percolation: build a 1D cluster\u2010like graph state by probabilistic fusion gates (Type-II fusion) on Bell pairs. By choosing which fusion measurements succeed, one crosses a percolation threshold in connectivity\u2014a photonic measurement-induced phase transition in graph connectivity.  \n  Step 2: Quick novelty/obstacles check.\n    1) Tree RG swapping: novel because prior Pytheus examples only did linear/swapping in parallel or qutrits; no one has done a two-level tree. Pytheus can do two Bell measurements + one more.  \n    2) MPS teleportation: mapping an MPS is effectively a state generation/task; also requires teleportation fidelity measure vs order\u2014hard to phrase as a single static target.  \n    3) Fusion percolation: cluster states are states, and fusion gates need hyper-entanglement references; also under \u201cstate generation.\u201d  \n  Step 3: Pick idea (1): the binary-tree entanglement-swapping RG module.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because, rather than just a chain of independent entanglement\u2010swapping operations, it implements a two-layer tree tensor\u2010network coarse-graining in a single linear\u2010optical circuit. No prior Pytheus experiment has tackled hierarchical, measurement\u2010driven renormalization of entanglement networks.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014Pytheus can place four probabilistic Bell-pair sources, route their outputs through beam splitters and phase shifters, and perform three post-selected Bell measurements (each realized by ancilla detectors) in a fixed circuit. The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d emerges by post-selecting on different combinations of those three Bell measurements (e.g. bottom-layer only vs bottom+top), and the tree geometry encodes a simple TTN. No dynamic feedback, no cavities.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input: \nHere is a suggestion for an experiment that combines the ideas of a tensor-network renormalization (a small tree-tensor-network) with a measurement-induced reconfiguration (\u201cphase\u201d) of the entanglement network.  The goal is not to generate a particular exotic state, but to demonstrate a **hierarchical entanglement-swapping module** that implements a two-level renormalization of a chain of Bell pairs.  By post-selecting on different subsets of Bell measurements one realizes different \u201cphases\u201d of network connectivity.\n\nDescription of the target network:\n  \u2022 Sources:\n    \u2013 Four independent probabilistic photon-pair sources S\u2081,\u2026,S\u2084, each emitting one Bell pair (two modes).\n    \u2013 Label the eight output modes as A1,A2 from S\u2081; B1,B2 from S\u2082; C1,C2 from S\u2083; D1,D2 from S\u2084.\n  \u2022 First (bottom) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform two simultaneous Bell-measurements M\u2081 on (A2,B1) and M\u2082 on (C2,D1).  \n      \u2022 Each Bell-measurement is realized by linear optics + two ancilla detectors; click patterns herald a successful swap.\n    \u2013 After M\u2081 one obtains a Bell pair between A1 and B2; after M\u2082 a Bell pair between C1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Second (top) layer of coarse-graining:\n    \u2013 Perform a third Bell-measurement M\u2083 on the two middle modes B2 and C1 (again via ancilla detectors).  \n      \u2022 A successful click heralds a final Bell pair between A1 and D2.\n  \u2022 Measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d:\n    \u2013 **Phase I** (shallow coarse-graining): post-select on M\u2081 & M\u2082 only.  The network coarsens from 4 pairs \u2192 two Bell pairs.\n    \u2013 **Phase II** (deep coarse-graining): post-select on all three M\u2081, M\u2082, M\u2083.  The network coarsens fully \u2192 one long-range Bell pair.\n  \u2022 Physics question:\n    \u2013 By comparing the output entanglement (Bell-violation or fidelity) between A1 and either B2/C1 (Phase I) vs A1\u2013D2 (Phase II), one directly observes a measurement-induced transformation of the tensor-network geometry (a minimal tree-tensor-network renormalization).  \n    \u2013 One can generalize to larger trees (more Bell pairs and more layers) to study measurement density vs entanglement length\u2014an optical analog of measurement-induced phase transitions in tensor-network models.\n  \u2022 Why Pytheus can design this:\n    \u2013 All operations are static linear-optical elements + probabilistic pair sources + photon-number-resolving detectors.\n    \u2013 No dynamic feedback or cavities are needed.\n    \u2013 One simply encodes the 8 input modes, specifies 3 sets of ancilla detectors (for M\u2081,M\u2082,M\u2083), and enforces that no single source connects A2 to D1 etc. using removed_connections.\n    \u2013 The target is the network transformation (hierarchical entanglement swapping), not a specific many-photon state.\n\nThis \u201cTree-Tensor-Network RG Module\u201d is a new kind of quantum network experiment: it melds tensor-network renormalization ideas with measurement-induced network phases, and can be generalized to deeper trees or to probabilistic measurement patterns.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is just the standard two\u2010hop entanglement swap (quantum repeater) in tree form, already well\u2010explored (see \u201cOne\u2010Shot Two\u2010Hop Entanglement Swap\u201d from the ensemble).  You\u2019ll need to propose a truly new measurement primitive or nontrivial network phase transition\u2014such as superposed swap orders, many\u2010body joint measurements, or nonlinear renormalization effects\u2014to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Post-selecting on joint detections realizes a superposed network renormalization\u2014and by measuring only one branch vs. both branches you drive a \u201cphase change\u201d in which coarse-graining order you implement.  \n  3) A small 1D cluster-like MPS of Bell pairs where you randomly intersperse or omit Bell measurements along the chain; as you vary the density of measurements you cross a percolation-threshold for end-to-end entanglement (a photonic analogue of a measurement-induced phase transition in an MPS).  \nStep 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check  \n  1) Two-layer TTN swapping is clean but arguably just a deeper repeater chain\u2014likely too close to previous cascaded\u2010swap examples.  \n  2) The quantum-switch of entanglement-swapping orders is new: no existing Pytheus experiment superposes two distinct tensor-network contraction orders via a single static circuit. It uses only linear-optics, probabilistic pair sources and photon-number-resolving detectors\u2014no feedback, no cavities.  \n  3) Measurement-density percolation on an MPS is conceptually nice but boils down to a longer chain of swaps; hard to realize a genuine \u201cphase\u201d in a 1D chain of only a few pairs.  \nStep 3: Pick idea (2) as most novel & Pytheus-compatible  \nStep 4: Novelty  \n  \u2022 First photonic demonstration of a quantum switch applied to entanglement-swapping\u2014i.e. a superposition of two tensor-network renormalization orders.  \n  \u2022 Unlike standard cascaded swapping, here the *order* of two BSMs is coherently controlled and becomes a resource.  \nStep 5: Feasibility in Pytheus  \n  \u2022 Static linear-optical circuit with four pair sources (3 data pairs + 1 control qubit as a path-encoded photon)  \n  \u2022 Two Bell-measurement modules realized by beam-splitters, phase-shifters and ancillary detectors (heralded post-selection)  \n  \u2022 No dynamic feed-forward; no physical hyper-entanglement required  \n  \u2022 The \u201cmeasurement-induced phase\u201d is seen by choosing to post-select on only one branch\u2019s success vs. both branches, or by reading out an interferometric phase on the control photon.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a proposal for Pytheus:  \n\nTitle: \u201cQuantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping Orders: a Measurement-Induced Renormalization Phase in a Photonic Tensor Network\u201d  \n\nObjective:  \nImplement, in a single static linear-optical circuit, a **controlled superposition** of two entanglement-swapping protocols on three Bell-pairs. The *order* in which two Bell-measurements are performed becomes coherently controlled by a separate \u201ccontrol\u201d photon, yielding an entanglement-renormalization quantum switch. By post-selecting on different subsets of heralding detectors one observes two distinct connectivity \u201cphases\u201d: a shallow coarse-graining (one swap) vs. a deep coarse-graining (two swaps), and\u2014when measuring the control photon\u2014an interference signature of the superposed swap orders.  \n\nSchematic description:  \n- Sources:  \n  \u2022 S\u2081 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dA,B\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2082 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dB,C\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2083 produces |\u03a6\u207a>\u208dC,D\u208e  \n  \u2022 S\u2080 prepares a single \u201ccontrol\u201d photon in (|0>+|1>)/\u221a2 (path-encoded)  \n- Controlled routing:  \n  \u2022 If control=|0\u27e9, route modes (B,C) into Bell-module M\u2081 and then (A,B) into M\u2082.  \n  \u2022 If control=|1\u27e9, route (A,B) into M\u2081 and then (B,C) into M\u2082 (the \u201copposite\u201d swap order).  \n  \u2022 Each Bell-module is realized by a 50/50 beam splitter, a phase-shifter, and two ancilla detectors whose click pattern heralds a successful swap.  \n- Post-selection and measurement phases:  \n  1) **Phase I (shallow)**: post-select **only** on the first module\u2019s clicks \u2192 yields two Bell pairs (one local pair + one intermediate pair).  \n  2) **Phase II (deep)**: post-select on **both** modules \u2192 yields a long-range Bell pair between A and D.  \n  3) **Interference signature**: finally, recombine the control paths on a beam splitter and look for fringes in its detector as a function of an internal phase shift\u2014this reveals the coherent superposition of the two swap orders.  \n\nWhy this is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n- **Static linear optics** + probabilistic photon-pair sources + number-resolving detectors only  \n- **No dynamic feedback**, no cavities or resonances  \n- Encodes a genuine **tensor-network renormalization** (two contraction orders on an MPS of length 4) and a **measurement-induced phase** (switching between shallow/deep coarse-graining and observing control-photon interference)  \n- Easily generalizable: add more layers (longer chains), more swap modules, or multi-arm switches to explore larger TTN structures and measurement-induced network phases.  \n\nI recommend feeding this description into Pytheus as a \u201ccontrolled-swap-order\u201d network target. It will search for the required beam-splitter/phase-shifter arrangement and detector assignments to realize this quantum-switch experiment.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The controlled superposition of two entanglement-swap sequences you describe duplicates the \u201cEntanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\u201d in our ensemble. To be PRL-worthy you must propose a truly novel measurement primitive or network phase\u2014e.g. higher-order joint projections, non-trivial superpositions of more than two swap orders, or a new many-body renormalization effect\u2014not simply a restatement of the existing quantum-switch swap-order scheme.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

To reach PRL novelty you must propose a genuinely new measurement primitive or non-trivial network effect (for instance superposed or non-commuting swap orders, many-body joint projections, or a measurement-driven critical point that cannot be reduced to independent Bell-swap success counts).\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

The idea is to take entanglement swapping and elevate it to an **indefinite causal order** of three swaps\u2014a photonic **3-switch**\u2014so that the *order* in which the swaps are applied is coherently superposed by a control qudit.  Measuring that control in different bases then causes a discontinuous jump in end-to-end entanglement yield\u2014a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.

The simplest yet novel scheme is to place a single intermediate node B on a three-site line A\u2013B\u2013C sharing Bell pairs (A\u2013B and B\u2013C). Node B can either perform a Bell\u2013measurement (entanglement swap \u2192 A\u2013C entangled) or a computational-basis measurement (destroy both links \u2192 no entanglement). If that choice itself is put into superposition by a control photon, then measuring the control in different bases induces a sharp \u201cphase change\u201d between end\u2010to\u2010end entanglement vs. no entanglement. This transformation is a network metamorphosis\u2014an entanglement-swapping vs. entanglement-severing switch\u2014rather than state generation, and it can be implemented with static linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, one single-photon emitter, and number-resolving detectors. It naturally generalizes to longer chains or higher-dimensional tensor networks. \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready target:  \n\n1) Data sources  \n   \u2022 Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081, S\u2082 creating |\u03a6\u207a> on modes (A,B) and (C,D).  \n   \u2022 Node B holds modes B and C.  \n\n2) Control qubit  \n   \u2022 One single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 = (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2 in two optical modes c\u2080 and c\u2081.\n\n3) Two measurement primitives at B  \n   \u2022 Bell-swap module M_swap: performs apost-selected Bell measurement on modes B,C (50/50 BS + phase shift + two ancilla detectors).

Pytheus can handle static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair sources, single-photon emitters, and number-resolving detectors, but cannot do feedback or cavities.  A three-port entanglement router (a joint 3-photon interferometric measurement) meets these requirements, creating a measurement-induced switch in network topology.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus-ready proposal:  \n\nTitle: \u201cMeasurement-Induced Entanglement Routing in a Three-Port Photonic Network\u201d\n\nObjective:\nImplement a **static** linear-optical circuit that takes three Bell pairs and\u2014via a single joint three-photon measurement\u2014heralds entanglement between **any two** of the three \u201cend\u201d modes.  By tuning a single internal phase, the network exhibits a **sharp routing transition**: the preferred entangled link jumps abruptly from one pair of output nodes to another as the phase crosses a critical value.  This is a bona fide **measurement-induced phase transition** of network connectivity.\n\n1) Sources and Modes  \n  \u2022 Bell-pair sources S\u2081,S\u2082,S\u2083 each probabilistically emit one pair in |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 onto modes (A\u2081,B\u2081), (A\u2082,B\u2082), (A\u2083,B\u2083).  \n  \u2022 Modes A\u2081,A\u2082,A\u2083 are the \u201cend\u201d nodes to be entangled; modes B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083 go into the router.\n\n2) Three-Port Router (Multiport Interferometer + Detectors)  \n  \u2022 A static 3\u00d73 multiport unitary U(\u03c6) acts on B\u2081,B\u2082,B\u2083.

It will optimize the internal beam-splitter reflectivities and phase settings so that exactly one click at D_i \u2192 maximal Bell fidelity between the corresponding A-nodes, and so that p_i(\u03c6) exhibits the desired sharp transitions in routing probability. This is the first minimal photonic demonstration of a **measurement-induced entanglement-routing phase transition** in a tensor-network setting.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: This is too close to prior entanglement-router schemes in our ensemble (e.g. the Pythreus-compatible multiplexed router and the double-controlled four-way entanglement router) and offers no fundamentally new joint measurement or network-phase effect.

This is a true tensor\u2010network effect (different local tensors at each bond) and not just state generation.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nHere is a Pytheus\u2010ready target that uses **two measurement primitives**\u2014Bell\u2010swap and 3-photon GHZ projection\u2014to induce a nontrivial percolation\u2010like phase transition in a short tensor network.  The goal is the **network transformation** (which end modes become entangled) as one varies the pattern of measurement clicks, not to generate a fixed state.\n\n1) Network layout  \n   \u2022 Five nodes A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013E, connected by four probabilistic Bell-pair sources S\u2081\u2026S\u2084 on bonds (A\u2013B),(B\u2013C),(C\u2013D),(D\u2013E).  \n   \u2022 Each bond \u2113 supports two possible measurement modules:\n     \u2013 M_swap,\u2113: a standard post-selected Bell-measurement on the two photons of that bond (50/50 BS + phase + 2 ancilla detectors).  \n     \u2013 M_GHZ,\u2113: a 3-photon GHZ analyzer acting on the two bond photons **plus** one ancilla photon from a local single-photon emitter.  It projects onto (|000\u27e9+|111\u27e9) (requires a small LO network + 2 ancilla detectors to herald success).  \n\n2) Static routing  \n   \u2022 For each \u2113=1\u20264, we include **both** M_swap,\u2113 and M_GHZ,\u2113 in the circuit.  Their outputs feed to separate ancilla detectors (total ancillas = 4\u00d72 for swaps + 4\u00d72 for GHZ = 16 ancilla detectors).  \n   \u2022 Use `removed_connections` to forbid Bell-pair sources from linking non-neighboring nodes, and to prevent any source from feeding both swap and GHZ modules on the same bond except via intended paths.\n\n3) Post-selection & measurement-induced \u201cphase\u201d  \n   \u2022 Let k_swap = number of M_swap modules that click, k_GHZ = number of M_GHZ modules that click.  \n   \u2022 **Phase I** (pure-swap regime): If k_GHZ=0, end-to-end entanglement A\u2013E arises only if k_swap \u2265 3 (standard repeater threshold).  \n   \u2022 **Phase II** (mixed regime): If k_GHZ \u2265 1, then A\u2013E entangles already when k_swap + 2\u00b7k_GHZ \u2265 3.  In other words, each GHZ click \u201ccounts twice,\u201d lowering the entanglement threshold.  \n   \u2022 By selecting data runs according to (k_swap,k_GHZ), one sees a **sharp change** in the minimal total number of ancilla clicks needed for end-to-end entanglement\u2014the network\u2019s percolation threshold shifts discontinuously when k_GHZ crosses from 0 to 1.  \n\n4) Why this is novel  \n   \u2022 **Two distinct measurement tensors** at each bond (swap vs GHZ) create a nontrivial phase diagram in the bond-success space (k_swap,k_GHZ).  \n   \u2022 The threshold for global connectivity (A\u2013E entanglement) undergoes a genuine **measurement-induced phase transition** when GHZ projectors enter the network.  \n   \u2022 No previous Pytheus experiment has mixed Bell-swaps with GHZ\u2010projectors in the same chain to alter the percolation threshold.  \n   \u2022 It is a true tensor\u2010network metamorphosis (each bond can use one of two contraction tensors) and the emergent behaviour is independent of any particular target quantum.\n\n5) Pytheus implementation details  \n   \u2022 **Sources:** 4 probabilistic Bell-pair emitters + 4 single-photon emitters for GHZ modules  \n   \u2022 **Modules:** 4 M_swap (each uses 2 ancilla detectors), 4 M_GHZ (each uses 2 ancilla detectors)  \n   \u2022 **End analyzers:** 2 detectors at A, 2 at E to verify Bell correlations when entangled  \n   \u2022 **removed_connections:** forbid direct source\u2192nonadjacent mode links and multiplexing across modules  \n   \u2022 **Target transformation:** For each (k_swap,k_GHZ), maximize Bell-correlation fidelity at A\u2013E if the above thresholds are met, and suppress it otherwise.\n\nThis specification focuses on an **entanglement-percolation phase diagram** in a minimal tensor network with dual measurement primitives.  Feed it into Pytheus to find the beam-splitter angles, phase shifts, and detector assignments that realize both swap and GHZ modules on each bond, and that produce the predicted shift in connectivity threshold.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: To achieve genuine PRL-level novelty, propose a nonfactorizable joint projector or an unexpected measurement-induced critical point that cannot be reduced to independent bond successes\u2014for instance, a multi-bond GHZ/fusion measurement that entangles more than two distant modes in a single shot, or a phase transition arising from entangling-order superpositions beyond simple threshold counting.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Varying the internal phase of that central interferometer drives a sharp switch in which pair of nodes become entangled: a measurement-induced network-connectivity phase transition.\n    2) A 1D chain of Bell pairs where each bond has two measurement options\u2014a standard Bell swap or a 3-photon GHZ projection with an ancilla photon.  Cross a threshold in the number of GHZ vs. swap clicks and you see a nontrivial shift in the percolation threshold for end-to-end entanglement.\n    3) A triangular MPS of three Bell pairs forming a ring, with a single 3-port interferometer that implements a **cyclic entanglement swap** among the three nodes.  Tuning a phase in the interferometer causes an abrupt network reconfiguration (from ring to star topology), an abrupt measurement-induced network phase change.\n\n  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:\n    1) **Most novel**: the square plus central 4-photon measurement is a truly new joint measurement primitive and realizes two distinct tensor-network contractions in one static circuit.

Three probabilistic Bell-pair sources connect A\u2013X\u2081, B\u2013X\u2082, C\u2013X\u2083.  At X we implement a **controlled measurement primitive**:\n\n \u2022 M_swap: a Bell-measurement on (X\u2081,X\u2082), projecting A\u2013B into an EPR pair and leaving C separate.  \n \u2022 M_GHZ: a 3-photon GHZ projection on (X\u2081,X\u2082,X\u2083), projecting A,B,C into a GHZ\u2083 state.  \n\nA single-photon emitter C\u2080 prepares a path-encoded qubit (|0\u27e9+|1\u27e9)/\u221a2.
