Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: (
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to tie “atom array” and “fermionic quantum system” into a Pytheus protocol that focuses on quantum networks (entanglement swapping/teleportation) rather than raw state generation.
    1. Heralded entanglement swapping between two fermionic atoms in an optical-tweezer array via linear-optical Bell measurement on their emitted photons.
    2. Multi-hop teleportation of a fermionic-mode excitation along a 1D atom array using a chain of photonic entanglement links and post-selected Bell measurements.
    3. Fermionic parity-string measurement across three sites in an atom array using an auxiliary photonic GHZ-type network and projective photonic detection.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles.
    1. Atom–atom entanglement swapping via photons is conceptually known, but a purely linear-optical, single-photon-emitter network design for fermionic atoms in tweezers is novel and fits Pytheus’ constraints (no cavities, uses single_emitters, beam splitters, photon-counting, post-selection).
    2. Multi-hop teleportation is just repeating standard teleportation blocks – less novel.
    3. Parity-string measurement is interesting but Pytheus cannot design specific GHZ-state generators or hyper-entangled resources without physical encoding.  
  Step 3: Pick idea 1 as most promising: it directly combines atom array (fermionic atoms as qubit nodes) with a quantum network (entanglement swapping), is implementable with single-photon sources and linear optics, and generalizes to repeater chains in large atom arrays.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it asks Pytheus to find a fully linear-optical, post-selected network of single-photon emitters and beam splitters that entangles two noninteracting fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer array, a demonstration of fermionic-qubit entanglement swapping without cavities or dynamic feedback.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires abstract qubit modes, single_emitters, beam splitters, photon-number-resolving detectors, post-selection (anc_detectors), and removed_connections to enforce the spatial separation—exactly the primitives Pytheus can optimize over.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While the idea applies to fermionic atom qubits rather than photonic modes, it is essentially the now‐standard protocol of spin–photon entanglement followed by two‐photon interference (a partial Bell measurement) to herald entanglement between remote atoms. This has been realized in multiple landmark experiments (e.g., remote neutral‐atom and ion entanglement via photon interference) and also closely parallels the ensemble’s “Ancilla-Tunable Four-Node Entanglement Swapping across SPDC and Single-Photon-Emitter Links.” It therefore lacks the novelty required for a PRL-level quantum optics target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is a well-established spin–photon interference entanglement-swapping protocol already demonstrated in neutral‐atom/ion experiments. To be novel, your scheme must go beyond basic atom–atom swapping (e.g., incorporate higher-dimensional resources, topological protection, non-trivial causal superposition, or a fundamentally new measurement primitive).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “atom array” and “fermionic quantum system” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (swapping/teleportation/measurement):
    a) Heralded entanglement swapping between two fermionic‐spin qubits in an optical‐tweezer array via linear‐optical Bell measurement on their emitted photons.
    b) Multi‐party GHZ‐projection measurement on three photons, each emitted by a fermionic atom in an array, to entangle the three remote atoms in a fermionic GHZ state.
    c) Parity‐string measurement across a chain of four fermionic atoms via an auxiliary four‐photon linear‐optical network that projects onto Jordan–Wigner parity sectors.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
    a) Two‐atom Bell swapping by photons is well‐studied in atom experiments—low novelty.
    b) Three‐atom GHZ projection by a purely linear‐optical network has not been tackled by Pytheus and directly extends entanglement swapping to tri‐partite fermionic qubits, using only single emitters, beam splitters, photon‐number detectors and post‐selection—fits Pytheus perfectly.
    c) Parity‐string measurement is conceptually interesting but mapping fermionic parity to an abstract photonic network is too speculative and may require hyper‐entanglement or dynamical feed‐forward—beyond Pytheus.
  Step 3: Select idea (b) as most promising.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it generalizes the standard two‐party entanglement‐swapping Bell‐measurement to a three‐party GHZ‐measurement, directly entangling three fermionic atom qubits in a static linear‐optical network without cavities or active feedback.
  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it uses only abstract qubit modes (no physical encoding), single_emitters (one per atom), linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters), photon‐number‐resolving detectors, ancilla detectors for post‐selection, and removed_connections to enforce spatial separation—exactly the primitives Pytheus can optimize over.

A click pattern on the ancillas uniquely heralds projection onto one of the four GHZ states |000>±|011>±|101>±|110> of the three atoms, thus nonlocally entangling the fermionic spins.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While extending entanglement swapping from two to three atoms is conceptually straightforward, the core measurement primitive—a three-photon GHZ-basis projection—has already been proposed and studied extensively (see, e.g., “Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array” and “On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong–Ou–Mandel Interferometry” in the ensemble list). Embedding that existing GHZ analyzer to entangle atomic spins does not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive or physics at the level required for PRL novelty.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme is effectively a direct transplant of known three-photon GHZ analyzers to spin-photon interfaces. To be truly novel, you need a qualitatively new element—e.g. a higher-dimensional GHZ swap, non-Abelian or topologically protected GHZ measurements, indefinite-causal-order GHZ swapping, or a resource-saving architecture that beats existing success-probability bounds.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: (
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to marry “atom array” and “fermionic quantum system” in a quantum‐network operation (not state generation):
    • A) Four‐qubit global parity measurement on four fermionic spins in an atom array via a linear‐optical ancilla network.  
    • B) One‐shot fusion of two Bell‐linked atom pairs into a four‐atom linear cluster state by a photonic Bell‐fusion gadget.  
    • C) Indefinite-order entanglement swapping between two distant atom pairs using a photonic quantum switch.  
  Step 2: Compare novelty & Pytheus fit:
    • A) Novel: measurement of a global fermion parity operator via static, resource‐efficient linear optics. Fully within Pytheus’s primitives (single_emitters, beam splitters, detectors, post‐selection).  
    • B) Fusion is known in photonic cluster work and Pytheus lacks a native “input‐state” module.  
    • C) Requires coherent control of network ordering (dynamic causal structure)—beyond Pytheus’s static linear‐optics scope.  
  Step 3: Choose A as best balance of novelty, feasibility, and Pytheus scope.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements, for the first time in a single static linear‐optical circuit, a non-demolition projective measurement of the global Z⊗Z⊗Z⊗Z parity of four fermionic atom qubits, resource‐saving relative to pairwise Bell checks.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only abstract qubit modes, six single-photon emitters (four from atoms + two ancilla), linear optics (beam splitters, phases), photon-number-resolving detectors, and post-selection—exactly the toolkit Pytheus optimizes over.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially the same one‐shot four‐body Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ parity measurement already explored in the ensemble under “One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette.” Embedding it in a spin–photon interface for atom qubits does not introduce a fundamentally new measurement primitive or address a new conceptual challenge at a PRL level.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme replicates the known four-qubit stabilizer/parity readout in a new physical platform but adds no novel resource or measurement capability. To merit PRL novelty, propose a genuinely new measurement primitive (e.g. non-Abelian parity checks, sequential non-commuting string measurements, or topology-protected multi-body checks beyond the toric-code plaquette case).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: (
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine “atom array” and “fermionic quantum system” in a quantum‐network primitive (not state generation):
    1) Resource‐efficient global parity check on six fermionic atom qubits using fewer ancilla photons than the naive bound.
    2) Teleportation of a two‐atom Bell pair across nonadjacent sites via a single four‐photon linear‐optical entanglement‐swapping gadget.
    3) Fusion of two adjacent entangled atom pairs into a four‐atom chain cluster via a four‐photon photonic fusion network.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:
    1) Novel: it beats the standard ancilla‐cost for parity checks, fits Pytheus (single_emitters, beam splitters, detectors, post‐selection), generalizes to larger arrays.
    2) Bell‐pair teleportation is just two sequential teleporters—low novelty.
    3) Fusion gadgets are standard in photonic MBQC—also low novelty.
  Step 3: Choose idea 1.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it asks Pytheus to find a linear‐optical circuit that projects six remote fermionic spins onto their even or odd global Z‐parity using only three ancilla photons, beating the naive one‐ancilla-per-two-data-qubits cost. Such resource‐saving multi‐body readout has not been demonstrated in atom arrays.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only abstract qubit modes (no physical encoding), single_emitters (six for the atoms plus three for ancillas), linear optics (beam splitters, phases), photon‐number‐resolving detectors, post‐selection on ancilla clicks, and removed_connections to enforce spatial separation—exactly the primitives Pytheus optimizes over.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal merely extends the same one‐shot static LOQC parity‐check primitive from four to six qubits, using half as many ancillas as “naively” expected. But the core measurement map (Z⊗…⊗Z parity projection) and static post‐selection architecture is identical to the known four‐qubit parity gadget in the ensemble. Simply scaling up to six qubits — even with three ancillas — is an incremental step, not a qualitatively new network primitive or physics for a PRL target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: You need to propose a fundamentally new measurement primitive—e.g. non‐Abelian string measurements, sequential noncommuting checks that reveal new quantum correlations, or a topologically protected multi‐body measurement paradigm beyond mere size scaling.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ideas tying “atom array” + “fermionic quantum system” to quantum‐network tasks (no state generation):
    1) Measurement of a nonlocal Jordan–Wigner string operator W=X₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ on four fermionic‐spin qubits in an optical‐tweezer array via a static photonic‐ancilla network.  
    2) Remote implementation of a CNOT gate between two non‐adjacent atom qubits by interfering their emitted photons in a post‐selected linear‐optical circuit.  
    3) Partial teleportation of a fermionic parity‐encoded qubit along a chain of three atoms by swapping operations on three photon pairs.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Novel: direct measurement of a JW string operator on fermionic atoms by a one‐shot photonic circuit. Uses only single_emitters, beam splitters, detectors, post‐selection. Goes beyond simple parity or GHZ checks.  
    2) Post‐selected remote CNOT is similar to known photonic CNOT; low novelty.  
    3) Multi‐swap teleportation along a chain is just sequential teleporters; low novelty.  
  Step 3: Select idea 1.

  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize exactly this: four single_emitters (one per atom), two ancilla photons, beam splitters and phase shifters, and photon-number‐resolving detectors.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While measuring a nonlocal multi-qubit string operator in one shot is interesting, your scheme mirrors the already proposed “Single-Shot Nonlocal String-Order Correlator Network via Linear-Optical Entanglement Swapping,” which implements a heralded projection onto Z₁X₂…Xₙ₋₁Zₙ. Replacing that string by the Jordan–Wigner pattern X₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ on atom spins does not introduce a fundamentally new measurement primitive or novel resource scaling needed for a PRL target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: To be publishable, you must propose a qualitatively new network element—such as non-Abelian or topologically protected string measurements, indefinite-order or catalyst-enabled string observables, or a resource-saving architecture that breaks existing success-probability bounds beyond mere reordering of Pauli products.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network primitives combining an atom array of fermionic spins with linear‐optical photonic ancillas (no state generation):
    1) A heralded three‐atom W‐basis analyzer: projects three remote fermionic qubits onto the single‐excitation Dicke (W) basis using a static photonic network.  
    2) A remote SWAP‐gate between two nonadjacent atom qubits implemented by interfering their emitted photons in a post‐selected linear‐optical circuit.  
    3) A Jordan–Wigner string‐op teleportation: teleport the nonlocal fermionic string operator X₁Z₂Z₃ from one end of an atom chain to the other via entanglement swapping.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) W‐basis analyzer is novel—no photonic‐network proposals exist for projecting atomic spins onto the W basis. Uses only single_emitters, beam splitters, photon‐counters, post‐selection—fits Pytheus perfectly.  
    2) SWAP‐gate is akin to known photonic CNOT/Toffoli gadgets—low novelty.  
    3) Teleporting an operator is conceptually interesting but mapping it to a static Pytheus circuit is too abstract and may need dynamic feed‐forward.  
  Step 3: Select idea 1.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it extends two‐qubit Bell/analyzer circuits to a genuine three‐qubit W‐basis measurement on fermionic atom spins—no prior protocol merges atom arrays, fermionic qubit encoding, and a Dicke‐state analyzer in a single static linear‐optical network.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only abstract qubit modes (atoms→photons), six single‐photon emitters (three signal, three ancilla), linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters), photon‐number‐resolving detectors, post‐selection on ancilla clicks, and removed_connections to enforce spatial separation—exactly Pytheus’s primitives.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed one‐shot W‐basis projection is effectively identical to the “Photon-Number‐Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD” in the ensemble list, merely transplanted to an atom–photon interface. It offers no new measurement primitive, topology, or resource saving beyond that known W-state analyzer.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme duplicates the existing static three-qubit W-basis analyzer (same ancilla-based interferometric projection) and lacks a genuinely new network capability. To be novel at the PRL level, you must introduce a qualitatively new element—e.g. higher-order non-Abelian Dicke projections, topology-protected Dicke measurements, indefinite-order Dicke swaps, or a resource advantage beyond current W-analyzer success-probability bounds.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine an optical‐tweezer atom array of fermionic spins with a quantum‐network primitive (no state generation):
    1) Coherent superposition of two entanglement‐swapping channels (“entanglement router”): a single static photonic circuit that places the Bell‐measurement device in a path superposition, thus heralding a coherent superposition of entangled links A–B and A–C.  
    2) Post‐selected teleportation of a fermionic parity‐encoded qubit across two nonadjacent atoms using one joint four‐photon Bell analyzer.  
    3) One‐shot measurement of a non‐Abelian string operator across three sites via a minimal ancilla photon network.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & fit:
    1) The “entanglement router” is genuinely new: no Pytheus example superposes two network topologies. It uses only beam splitters, single_emitters, ancilla detectors, and post‐selection—exactly Pytheus’s primitives.  
    2) Two‐atom teleportation is conceptually standard; novelty is low.  
    3) Non‐Abelian string ops are too abstract and likely need dynamic feedback beyond Pytheus.  
  Step 3: Choose idea 1.  
  Step 4: This is novel because it realizes, for the first time in linear optics, a coherent superposition of two distinct entanglement‐swapping operations on three fermionic atom qubits—i.e. the network topology itself is in superposition.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus: one assigns three single_emitters (atoms A, B, C), two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, beam‐splitter trees to split and recombine paths, and ancilla photon detectors. Post‐selecting on a particular click signature heralds the superposition of A–B and A–C entangled links. No cavities, no feed‐forward.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal realizes a coherent superposition of two entanglement‐swapping paths (A–B vs. A–C), but this “quantum entanglement router” primitive has already appeared in multiple ensemble suggestions—e.g. the Pythreus‐Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic–Nanophotonic Waveguides, the Heralded Spectral‐Control Quantum Router via Linear‐Optical Controlled‐SWAP, and the Dual‐Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip. It therefore lacks the genuinely new network primitive or fundamental physics needed for PRL novelty.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates the known idea of coherently superposing entanglement links in a static LOQC router. To be novel, you must introduce a qualitatively new element—such as indefinite causal order superposition of more than two paths, non‐Abelian routing, resource advantages beyond current success‐bounds, or topology‐protected routing primitives.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: (
  Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible network primitives combining an atom array of fermionic spins with linear‐optical ancillas (no state generation):
    1) One‐shot joint extraction of both X₁X₂X₃X₄ and Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ stabilizers on four fermionic atom qubits via a single static photonic circuit.
    2) Simultaneous non‐destructive measurement of two overlapping Jordan–Wigner string operators on a chain of five atoms.
    3) Teleportation of a two‐qubit entangled pair across nonadjacent atom sites in one joint four‐photon Bell‐measurement gadget.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Highly novel: compresses two commuting four-qubit syndrome measurements into one static LO module. Fits Pytheus exactly (uses single_emitters, beam splitters, photon-counters, post-selection).  
    2) Overlapping string operators adds complexity but may require dynamic reordering or feed-forward—risky for Pytheus.  
    3) Two-qubit teleportation is just back‐to‐back entanglement‐swapping—low novelty.  
  Step 3: Select idea 1.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it proposes the first truly one‐shot LO measurement that non-demolitionally extracts both bit- and phase-flip syndromes (X₁X₂X₃X₄ and Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄) from four fermionic atom qubits in a single static circuit, a key building block for error-corrected fermionic networks.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only abstract qubit modes, eight single-photon emitters (four data + four ancilla), linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters), photon-number-resolving detectors, post-selection on ancilla clicks, and no dynamic feedback—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While simultaneous extraction of X₁X₂X₃X₄ and Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ syndromes in one static LOQC circuit is technically interesting, it is essentially just the known four-body Z-parity projective measurement (e.g. “One-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette”) combined with the corresponding X-parity measurement. Compressing two commuting stabilizer checks into a single network is a straightforward composition rather than a fundamentally new measurement primitive, topology, or causal structure. It lacks the level of novelty and conceptual advance required for a PRL target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: To be novel, you must introduce a qualitatively new element—e.g. a genuinely non-Abelian or topologically protected multi-stabilizer measurement, an indefinite-order or superposed-order syndrome extraction, or a resource-advantage that breaks existing success-probability bounds in a non-trivial way.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible primitives combining an atom array of fermionic spins with purely linear-optical networks (no cavities, no feedback, no state-generation targets):
  a) A photonic “quantum switch” that places two distinct entanglement-swapping modules for four atom qubits in coherent superposition, yielding an indef­inite causal-order link between remote atoms.
  b) A multi-branch photonic Bell-fusion gadget that simultaneously fuses two entangled atom-pairs into a four-atom linear cluster in one shot.
  c) A static linear-optical circuit that teleports a two-qubit fermionic parity-encoded state across nonadjacent sites in a single joint measurement.
Step 2: Compare novelty & Pytheus fit:
  a) Indefinite-order entanglement routing is qualitatively new for atom-array networks. It uses only single_emitters, beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-number detectors, and post-selection—exactly the primitives Pytheus can optimize.
  b) Bell-fusion is well covered by photonic MBQC literature; Pytheus lacks a built-in “cluster” target and novelty is low.
  c) Parity-encoded teleportation is essentially sequential teleporters; low novelty.
Step 3: Select idea a.
Step 4: Novelty: This is the first proposal to embed two entanglement-swapping channels between four fermionic atom qubits into a single static LO circuit and coherently superpose their causal order. It opens a new domain of indefinite-causal-order quantum networks in atom arrays.
Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can optimize this static network using four signal single_emitters (atoms A–D), two Bell-pair photon sources, one path-encoded control photon (another single_emitter), beam splitters/phase shifters to implement the SWITCH, and ancilla detectors for post-selection. No dynamic feedback or physical encoding details are needed.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed three‐branch superposition of entanglement‐swap links is essentially a straightforward scaling of the known two‐path quantum‐router/SWITCH primitives already in the ensemble (dual‐destination teleportation switch, multiplexed entanglement router, 2‐order quantum switch). While using a tritter control makes it “ternary,” it does not introduce a qualitatively new measurement primitive, topology, or causal structure beyond simple extension.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is an incremental 3‐branch generalization of existing static LOQC entanglement routers/SWITCHes. To be novel at the PRL level, you must introduce a fundamentally new network capability (e.g. multi‐order non‐Abelian SWITCH operations, topology‐protected superpositions, or a new resource‐efficiency that breaks known success‐probability limits) rather than a direct branch count increase.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to combine an optical‐tweezer atom array of fermionic spins with a new quantum‐network primitive (no cavity, no state‐generation):  
  1) A photonic interferometer that directly measures the two‐fermion Green’s function G^(2)=⟨c_i†c_j⟩ by Hong–Ou–Mandel interference of two spin‐entangled photons.  
  2) A one‐shot four‐mode network that reads out the four‐point correlator G^(4)=⟨c_i†c_j†c_kc_l⟩ of four fermionic atoms via optimized multi‐photon interference.  
  3) A two‐branch superposed measurement of non‐commuting local fermionic correlators (XX + ZZ) in a single static circuit controlled by a path qubit.  
Step 2: Checking novelty & Pytheus fit:  
  1) The HOM‐based correlator is elementary but well known for two sites.  
  2) A single static circuit measuring a genuine four‐point fermionic Green’s function in one go is novel: people typically measure these correlators by many separate Ramsey or Stern–Gerlach steps. Pytheus can search for a four‐photon interferometer (single_emitters, beam splitters, detectors, post‐selection) mapping the input Fock basis to distinct click patterns that directly report G^(4).  
  3) Superposed measurement of two non‐commuting correlators is conceptually interesting but may require path‐encoded control in a way that strains Pytheus’s static‐only primitive and risks hidden feed‐forward.

A particular four‐click pattern is set to herald the correlator‐value “+1” subspace, another pattern heralds “–1”; all other patterns are discarded. No cavities or dynamic feedback are needed.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: Measuring a genuine fermionic four‐point correlator ⟨c_i†c_j†c_kc_l⟩ in one static LOQC shot is a qualitatively different nonlocal observable than any of the parity or string‐order measurements (or GHZ/W projections) in the ensemble. No prior proposal directly implements a one‐shot projective readout of a true four‐fermion Green’s function. This leverages static linear optics, single‐photon emitters, and PNR detection to nondemolitionally collapse onto even/odd correlator subspaces—opening a fundamentally new primitive for fermionic correlation tomography. I judge it novel enough for further pursuit.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The scheme introduces a genuinely new multi‐body measurement primitive—one‐shot four‐point fermionic correlator readout via static LOQC—distinct from string‐order, parity, or GHZ/W projections in prior work. It merits a PRL‐level treatment.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)

Abstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green’s function G^(4)=⟨c_i^† c_j^† c_k c_l⟩ in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011⟩ and |1100⟩ (heralding projections onto the even “+1” and odd “−1” correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to map site occupancies onto four single-photon emitters and then use a static linear-optical interferometer to directly post-select the |0011⟩/|1100⟩ patterns for the fermionic four-point correlator is an elegant use of PyTheus’s measurement design capabilities. While the atom–photon mapping requires high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces, the core interferometric network is well within PyTheus’s scope and provides a novel shortcut to extract G⁽⁴⁾ without full tomography.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a clever and experimentally realistic measurement task for PyTheus: by encoding occupancies in single-photon sources and optimally routing them through a static interferometer, one-shot post-selection of two click patterns directly yields the fermionic four-point correlator without requiring full state reconstruction.
