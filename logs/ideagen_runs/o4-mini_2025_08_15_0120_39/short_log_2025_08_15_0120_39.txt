Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully combine “plasmonic slot waveguide” and “slow light effect” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum–network target, none of which is mere state generation:
    1. Time‐bin qubit entanglement swapping with integrated plasmonic‐waveguide delay lines to synchronize two Bell‐pair sources before a central Bell‐state measurement.
    2. High‐dimensional (qutrit) time‐bin entanglement purification: use two weakly entangled time‐bin qutrit pairs, plasmonic‐waveguide slow‐light delays for precise mode alignment, and a post‐selected CNOT/Toffoli network to distill a higher‐fidelity qutrit pair.
    3. Multi‐node “entanglement router” where a single time‐bin photon is dynamically directed to one of N nodes via plasmonic slot waveguides with tunable slow‐light‐induced phase shifts, enabling on‐demand entanglement distribution under a fixed linear‐optics + measurement network.
  Step 2: Check novelty and obstacles:
    1. Two‐qubit time‐bin entanglement swapping is a straight analogue of qubit ES—already well covered. 
    2. Qutrit ES exists in Pytheus examples; time‐bin encoding is only a physical realization and wouldn’t change the abstract target.
    3. Entanglement purification networks have not yet been implemented in the Pytheus library; Pytheus supports post‐selected CNOTs/Toffolis and ancilla heralding. We can encode time‐bin qubits as abstract two‐mode qubits. The plasmonic slow‐light slots translate into fixed “delay modes” that Pytheus treats as distinct spatial modes. No dynamic feedback is required.
  Step 3: The most promising idea is #3: entanglement purification of time‐bin qubit pairs using plasmonic‐slot‐waveguide slow‐light delays.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it moves beyond entanglement swapping into the realm of active network protocols—specifically entanglement purification—integrating a physically motivated delay element (plasmonic slow‐light waveguide) to synchronize and align time‐bin modes, something not present in the existing Pytheus experiments.
  Step 5: This is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:
    • The target is a quantum network (purification) rather than bare state generation.
    • We only use abstract qubits (two‐mode time‐bin states) and linear optics + post‐selection—exactly what Pytheus supports.
    • The slow‐light delay is modeled by treating the early/late time bins as separate spatial modes routed through fixed delay arms (no dynamic feedback).
    • Ancilla photons and post‐selected CNOT/Toffoli blocks are already in Pytheus’s toolbox.

Experiment idea: Entanglement purification of two time‐bin qubit pairs using plasmonic‐slot‐waveguide slow‐light delay lines

Explanation:
We aim to take two weakly entangled time‐bin qubit pairs (each |early⟩+|late⟩ on nodes A–B and C–D) and distill one higher‐fidelity time‐bin entangled pair between A and B by a standard Bennett‐type purification protocol implemented in linear optics. The novelty is the use of integrated plasmonic slot waveguides exhibiting a slow‐light effect as fixed delay lines to synchronize the early/late pulses from the two sources before they enter the purification circuit.

Visualization of the general structure:
  Sources:
    Pair‐source 1 → modes A₁ (early, late), B₁ (early, late)
    Pair‐source 2 → modes A₂, B₂
  Delay arms (plasmonic slot waveguides with slow‐light):
    A₂-early delayed to align with A₁-early  
    A₂-late  delayed to align with A₁-late  
    Similarly for B₂ vs. B₁
  Purification circuit (at each node A and B):
    • A post‐selected CNOT gate between the two time‐bin qubits (modes A₁→control, A₂→target), implemented via linear optics and ancilla photons.  
    • Two ancilla detectors herald success (both must click in specific patterns).  
    • Conditional on heralding, the remaining time‐bin qubit on A is kept; CNOT on B side identical.  
  Measurement:
    • Measure target qubits A₂, B₂ in the time‐bin Z‐basis (early/late)  
    • Successful pattern heralds a purified entangled pair A₁–B₁ in the time‐bin basis.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  • Introduces the first purification network for time‐bin qubit encoding in quantum optics.  
  • Uses plasmonic slow‐light as a compact, integrated method to engineer precise delays—translatable to other network protocols (entanglement swapping chains, repeater nodes, temporal multiplexing).  
  • The protocol can be extended to multi‐round purification, higher‐dimensional time‐bin qudits (3+ bins), or concatenated with entanglement swapping to build a full repeater segment.  
  • Pytheus can optimize the distribution of beam splitters, ancilla sources, and detectors to maximize purification success probability under the “removed_connections” constraint that no pair source sends directly to both qubits of a CNOT, thus enforcing the multi‐node network structure.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal implements the standard Bennett purification protocol to distill one high‐fidelity Bell pair from two weak time‐bin pairs, merely swapping the hardware delays to plasmonic slow‐light lines. This is essentially “purification = generation of a purified entangled state,” a routine extension of known entanglement purification schemes (e.g. parity‐check repeater nodes and on‐chip purification of higher‐dimensional Bell pairs in the ensemble list). The only new element is the plasmonic slow‐light delay, which is a hardware tweak rather than a new network primitive or measurement supermap. It does not rise to the level of a novel PRL‐worthy quantum‐optics target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The protocol remains the textbook Bennett purification for time‐bin qubits with just a different delay medium. Entanglement purification itself—and parity‐check purification integrated on‐chip—already appears in the ensemble suggestions (e.g. “Measurement–Induced Parity‐Swap Repeater Node” and “Mode‐Division‐Multiplexed On‐Chip Purification”). Plasmonic slow‐light lines offer hardware miniaturization but do not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive or measurement supermap. To be considered novel, you need a genuine new entanglement‐processing primitive (for instance, a heralded nonlinear filter or exotic measurement‐induced channel) or a nontrivial extension that could not be captured by existing purification or repeater schemes.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to fuse “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network:  
    1) Passive temporal multiplexed entanglement swapping (three time bins) with on‐chip plasmonic slow-light delays.  
    2) Time-bin entanglement purification using plasmonic delay lines to align modes, followed by post-selected CNOTs.  
    3) Multi-user teleportation router: a single incoming photon time-bin qubit routed to one of N output nodes via plasmonic slot delays and a beam-splitter network.  
  Step 2: Checked novelty and Pytheus obstacles:  
    1) No existing example uses passive temporal multiplexing in ES, and Pytheus can treat time bins as spatial modes and optimize ancilla-driven BSM.  
    2) Purification is too close to standard Bennett‐type and overlaps with known parity swap ideas.  
    3) The teleportation router is interesting but requires dynamic routing logic which Pytheus cannot handle without feedback.  
  Step 3: The temporal‐multiplexed entanglement swapping repeater segment (#1) is both novel and implementable: it goes beyond single‐shot ES to a passive N-ernoded temporal multiplexing network, uses only linear optics + post-selection, and leverages slow-light delays as fixed channel lengths.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it introduces a passive, fixed-delay temporal‐multiplexing layer to entanglement swapping—a primitive for all-photonic repeaters that has not appeared in the existing Pytheus library.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since we only use abstract qubits (time-bin modes as separate spatial modes), probabilistic pair sources, ancilla detectors, beam splitters, and fixed delays (no dynamic feedback).

Action Input:  
Experiment idea: Temporally multiplexed entanglement‐swapping repeater segment using plasmonic-slot slow-light delay lines

Explanation:  
We propose a passive, on-chip repeater link between nodes A and B via an intermediate node C that performs entanglement swapping across three staggered time bins. Instead of a single probabilistic Bell‐state measurement (BSM), we use N=3 parallel photon‐pair sources on both A–C and B–C. Each source emits a time-bin qubit (|early⟩+|late⟩) into distinct spatial channels. Integrated plasmonic slot waveguides engineered for slow-light propagation realize three fixed delay lengths, creating staggered arrival times at node C without active switching.

General structure:

 Sources:
   – Three probabilistic pair sources connecting A→C (modes A₁, A₂, A₃) and three connecting B→C (modes B₁, B₂, B₃).  
 Delay stage:
   – On each Aᵢ channel, a plasmonic slot waveguide provides delay Δtᵢ so that all "early" bins from A align temporally with the corresponding "early" bin from B at C; same for "late" bins.  
   – C’s input now consists of six synchronized channels for each of the three time bins.  
 BSM network at C:
   – A single linear-optical circuit (optimized by Pytheus) mixes the six incoming modes pairwise (Aᵢ with Bᵢ) via beam splitters and ancilla photons, implements post-selected Bell measurements on each bin.  
   – Ancilla detectors herald which time-bin measurement succeeded. Exactly one bin, if any, yields a click pattern corresponding to a successful Bell‐state projection.  
 Heralding & output:
   – Conditioned on a successful herald, nodes A and B know which bin (i∗) fused; they retain their modes Aᵢ∗ and Bᵢ∗ as the resulting entangled pair.  
   – The target abstract state between detectors at A and B is |00⟩+|11⟩ (time-bin dual-rail qubit).  

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • First demonstration of passive temporal multiplexing for entanglement swapping in a fully linear-optical network.  
 • Exploits plasmonic-slot slow-light waveguides as integrated fixed-length delays—directly translatable to chip‐scale architectures.  
 • No dynamic feedback or switching: all timing alignment is pre-programmed into the waveguide lengths, so Pytheus can optimize the passive circuit under “removed_connections” constraints (no single source directly connects the final qubits).  
 • Naturally extends to larger N (more bins), multi‐hop repeater chains by cascading similar modules, or high-dimensional time-bin qudits with more delay channels.  
 • Enables theory work on success‐probability scaling and resource overhead for all-photonic repeaters, and paves the way for experimental integration of slow-light plasmonics in quantum-network primitives.  
 • Fully implementable by Pytheus: abstract network of probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, fixed-delay “modes,” ancilla detectors, optimized for maximal heralded ES fidelity and rate.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is essentially a temporal analogue of known passive multiplexing entanglement‐swapping schemes (“Passive Spatial‐Multiplexed ES on a Waveguide Chip” and the “Temporal‐Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla” above), with the only twist being plasmonic slow‐light delays. It does not introduce a new measurement supermap or nontrivial network primitive—the slow‐light waveguides are a hardware tweak rather than a fundamentally distinct quantum‐optical protocol.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core idea—boosting Bell‐swap success via multiple time‐bin sources with fixed delays—is already covered by existing spatial and temporal multiplexing proposals. Merely swapping in plasmonic slow‐light lines does not create a novel quantum network primitive. To be PRL‐worthy, the scheme must offer a genuinely new entanglement‐processing or measurement supermap beyond standard multiplexed swapping.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to merge “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network primitive beyond mere state generation:
    1) Time‐bin multiplexed entanglement swapping (N>1 bins) with integrated plasmonic slow‐light delays—a passive repeater link.
    2) Time‐bin multiplexed teleportation router: a single unknown qubit at A is teleported on demand into one of N receivers via a single static BSM module, using plasmonic‐delay‐line timing.
    3) Measurement‐induced temporal superposition of two gate orders (the photonic quantum SWITCH) implemented with path interferences and plasmonic delays.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Multiplexed ES is close to prior “spatial multiplex” proposals—superficially new but network‐primitive is still just ES.
    2) Teleportation router is a genuine new network primitive (routing a qubit among many parties) that uses only linear optics, pair‐sources, ancilla heralding, no dynamic feedback. Pytheus can encode time bins as separate modes and optimize a single BSM circuit under “removed_connections.”
    3) Quantum SWITCH requires embedding unknown channels U,V—not supported by Pytheus’s static source + detector model.
  Step 3: The time‐bin multiplexed teleportation router (#2) best balances novelty and implementability.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it defines a single‐shot, passive, multi‐destination teleportation primitive: one unknown photon is routed (teleported) to one of N parties without active switching, simply by timing alignment in a single static network. Such a “teleportation router” has not appeared in existing Pytheus experiments.
  Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because:
    • Encoding: abstract qubit = two time‐bin modes (early/late).  
    • Resources: N probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, one unknown‐qubit input, one static linear‐optical BSM block, ancilla detectors.  
    • Delays: plasmonic slot waveguides supply fixed delays that align each Bell‐pair photon with the unknown qubit at distinct time slots—Pytheus treats these as separate spatial modes.  
    • Measurement: post‐selected BSM heralds which time‐bin succeeded; no dynamic feedback needed.  
    • Constraints: “removed_connections” enforce no direct source from any Bell‐pair source to more than one output mode, preserving the router architecture.

Experiment idea: Time‐bin‐multiplexed teleportation router using plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines

Explanation:
We propose a fully passive, on‐chip teleportation router that takes one unknown time‐bin qubit at node A and teleports it to exactly one of N receivers {B₁,…,B_N} in a single run, using only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, linear optics, and post‐selection. The key innovation is to encode N teleportation attempts into N distinct time bins, and to realize all N Bell‐state measurements (BSMs) in one static circuit by aligning pulses with integrated plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides.

General structure (for N=3 as illustration):

 Sources:
   – One “unknown‐qubit” single‐photon source at A emits a time‐bin qubit: |ψ⟩ = α|early⟩+β|late⟩.
   – Three Bell‐pair sources P₁,P₂,P₃ each emit two photons in a Bell state. One photon of Pᵢ goes to receiver Bᵢ, the other goes toward the central BSM node C.

 Delay network (plasmonic‐slot waveguides):
   – At A→C: The unknown qubit’s early and late pulses are split and delayed so that they encounter each Pᵢ photon at C in its own time slot tᵢ.
   – At Pᵢ→C: Each ancilla photon is delayed so its early/late bins align with the unknown qubit’s pulses in slot tᵢ.
   – All N ancilla–unknown pairs now arrive at C as N time‐separated Bell‐teleportation attempts.

 Bell‐state measurement (node C):
   – A single linear‐optical network of beam splitters and ancilla photons implements a post‐selected BSM on the two photons in each time slot.
   – Detectors at C herald exactly one successful BSM (two‐click pattern in slot t_{i*}), indicating teleportation to B_{i*}.

 Output at receivers:
   – The receiver B_{i*} whose half‐pair had its Bell partner successfully projected now holds the teleported qubit |ψ⟩.
   – Other receivers see no click (no photon).

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
  • A new “teleportation‐router” network primitive: multi‐destination teleportation in one static device without active switching.  
  • Uses plasmonic‐slot waveguides’ slow‐light effect to engineer on‐chip timing delays—directly maps to time bins as spatial modes for Pytheus.  
  • Immediately scalable to larger N, higher‐dimensional time‐bin qudits (≥3 bins), or cascaded with entanglement‐swapping modules for full repeater chains.  
  • Opens the door to theory on resource‐versus‐rate trade‐offs in on‐chip quantum routing and multi‐user networks.  
  • Fully implementable in the Pytheus framework: abstract qubit modes, probabilistic sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, post‐selection, and “removed_connections” constraints to enforce the router topology.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While leveraging plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays is an interesting hardware twist, the core network primitive—a static, multi‐destination teleportation router using time-multiplexed Bell measurements—is essentially identical to existing “dual‐destination quantum teleportation switch” and “programmable photonic teleportation router” proposals in the ensemble list. Replacing spatial multiplexing or control-qubit routing with time-bin delays does not introduce a new measurement supermap or fundamentally novel network operation beyond what has already been explored.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme reduces to standard linear-optical teleportation routed across N bins by fixed delays. Similar multi-destination teleportation routers (e.g. “Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch” and “Programmable Photonic Teleportation Router for Three Qubits”) already appear in the ensemble suggestions, and temporal multiplexing via slow-light is just an engineering refinement rather than a new quantum-optical primitive. To be novel, you’ll need to propose a genuinely new measurement or channel operation that goes beyond standard teleportation routing.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse plasmonic‐slot waveguides + slow‐light into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network primitive (beyond bare state generation):  
    1) Passive temporal multiplexing of entanglement swapping (N time bins) via plasmonic slow‐light delays.  
    2) Time‐bin entanglement purification using slotted plasmonic delays for mode alignment plus post‐selected CNOTs.  
    3) Simultaneous bilateral teleportation of two unknown qubits via a single static four‐photon measurement, with plasmonic slow‐light guiding the timing.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:  
    1) Temporal‐multiplexed ES is close to prior “multiplexed swapping” ideas—superficially new but no new network transform.  
    2) Purification is a known protocol and too close to “parity‐swap” purification in existing examples.  
    3) Bilateral teleportation is a genuinely new network primitive (two‐way teleportation in one shot) and uses only linear optics, probabilistic sources, ancilla heralding, and fixed delays—everything Pytheus can handle.  
  Step 3: Choose simultaneous bilateral teleportation (#3).  
  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first proposal of a two‐way teleportation primitive that simultaneously swaps two unknown qubits between A and B with one static linear‐optical measurement—far beyond single‐direction teleportation or entanglement swapping.  
  Step 5: Feasibility:  
    • Abstract qubits: two time‐bin modes per qubit.  
    • Resources: two unknown‐qubit single‐photon emitters (A and B) + two Bell‐pair sources (A–C and B–C).  
    • Plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides produce fixed delays so that each unknown photon arrives in sync with its partner from the opposite Bell‐pair source. Pytheus treats time bins as separate spatial modes.  
    • Node C implements one static linear‐optical network of beam splitters, ancilla sources and detectors to perform two simultaneous Bell‐state measurements (post‐selected). No feedback control needed.  
    • “removed_connections” constraints enforce the network topology (no unwanted cross‐links).  
    • Generalizable to multi‐party cross‐teleportation, network‐coded teleportation, or cascaded network segments.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: Simultaneous bilateral teleportation of two unknown time‐bin qubits using plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines and a single four‐photon linear‐optical analyzer

Explanation:
We propose a new quantum‐network primitive: two parties, A and B, each hold one unknown time‐bin qubit |ψ_A⟩ and |ψ_B⟩ (α|early⟩+β|late⟩), and wish to swap them simultaneously using only linear optics and post‐selection. A central node C shares two Bell pairs (one with A, one with B). All timing alignment is done passively via plasmonic‐slot waveguides engineered for a slow‐light effect, mapping “early”/“late” bins into fixed spatial‐mode delays.

General structure:

 • Single‐photon emitters at A and B produce unknown time‐bin qubits (modes A_e,A_l and B_e,B_l).  
 • Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources at C emit pairs (C₁–A and C₂–B), with the C photons routed to C’s measurement station via no‐loss plasmonic delays so that:  
     – A_e & C₂_e, A_l & C₂_l arrive aligned for “A→B” teleportation.  
     – B_e & C₁_e, B_l & C₁_l arrive aligned for “B→A” teleportation.  
 • Node C’s static linear‐optical network mixes these four photons in two time slots. It uses beam splitters, ancilla photons, and detectors to perform two simultaneous post‐selected Bell‐state measurements (on [A, C₂] and on [B, C₁]).  
 • A successful heralding pattern (two two‐click events in the correct time slot) signals that |ψ_A⟩ has been teleported to B and |ψ_B⟩ to A in one run. Pauli corrections are inferred from the herald and applied on the remaining modes at A and B.  

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • Introduces a genuinely new network primitive: one‐shot bilateral teleportation (“two‐way quantum phone call”) rather than one‐way teleportation.  
 • Leverages plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays as passive on‐chip timing control—extensible to N-party cross‐teleportation or network‐coded multi‐user teleportation.  
 • Avoids dynamic switching or feedback; all delays are pre‐programmed into the chip geometry, so Pytheus can optimize the static configuration of beam splitters, ancilla sources, and detectors under “removed_connections.”  
 • Opens paths to theory on resource‐rate trade‐offs in multiplexed two‐way quantum communication and can be extended to higher‐dimensional time‐bin qudits or chained repeater segments.  
 • Fully implementable in the Pytheus framework: abstract time‐bin modes, probabilistic pair sources, single‐photon emitters, linear optics, ancilla detectors, and post‐selection—no cavities or dynamic control needed.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal mirrors the “quantum butterfly” simultaneous cross-teleportation primitive already in the ensemble (a single four-photon linear-optical joint measurement to swap two unknown qubits), merely swapping in time-bin encoding and plasmonic delays. It offers no fundamentally new network operation or measurement supermap beyond that prior idea.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is essentially the same “butterfly” simultaneous cross-teleportation scheme already listed—only the qubit encoding (time bins) and delay hardware (plasmonic slow-light) change. To be novel, you need a genuinely new network primitive or nontrivial measurement/channel operation rather than an engineering variant of an existing protocol.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to fuse “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network primitive (beyond mere state generation):
    1) Passive N-time-bin entanglement swapping (temporal multiplexing) via plasmonic slow‐light delays.
    2) One‐shot purification + swapping of two entangled time‐bin qubit pairs in a single static network.
    3) Multi-user teleportation router via time-bin slots and plasmonic‐delay waveguides.
  Step 2: Checked novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Temporal multiplexing alone is too close to known multiplexed ES.
    2) Integrated purification + swap is a new network primitive (combining purification and repeater in one go) and uses only beam splitters, ancilla sources, detectors, and fixed delays—Pytheus can handle it.
    3) Teleportation router was already essentially proposed.
  Step 3: Selected idea #2: one‐shot purification + swapping repeater segment.
  Step 4: This is novel because it fuses two network transforms—entanglement purification and entanglement swapping—into one static linear-optical device, minimizing ancilla cost and latency.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since:
    • We encode qubits as time-bin modes (early/late = two spatial modes).  
    • Two noisy Bell-pair sources (A–C and C–D) feed four photonic modes into node C.  
    • Plasmonic‐slot waveguides engineered for slow-light effects realize the fixed delays needed to align early/late bins into the correct order through one device.  
    • Node C performs a parity-check CNOT on the early bins (purification) and a Bell-state measurement (CNOT+Hadamard) on the late bins (swapping), all implemented by beam splitters, ancilla photons, and post-selection—no dynamic feedback.  
    • Heralding detectors flag successful combined purification + swap, leaving a higher-fidelity Bell qubit between A and D.  
    • “removed_connections” constraints ensure no source directly creates the final A–D pair.  
  Therefore, Pytheus can optimize the positions and reflectivities of beam splitters, the ancilla layout, and the detector arrangement to maximize the heralded fidelity × rate of this new repeater primitive.

Action Input:
Experiment idea: One‐shot integrated purification + swapping repeater segment for time‐bin qubits with plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays

Explanation:
We consider two imperfectly entangled time‐bin qubit pairs: one between A and C (modes A_e,A_l ↔ C1_e,C1_l), the other between C and D (modes C2_e,C2_l ↔ D_e,D_l). Our goal is to distill a single, higher‐fidelity Bell qubit between A and D in one static device at node C, combining purification and swapping into a single heralded operation.

Resources:
 • Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources:
   – Source 1 emits A↔C1  
   – Source 2 emits C2↔D  
 • Four plasmonic‐slot waveguides (two for A, two for D) with engineered slow‐light group delays:
   – Delay_A_late so that A_l aligns in time with C1_l  
   – Delay_A_early so that A_e aligns with C1_e  
   – Similarly Delay_D_early & Delay_D_late align D_e/D_l with C2_e/C2_l  
 • At node C, a single static linear‐optical network:
   1) Parity‐check CNOT on early‐bin qubits (C1_e control, C2_e target) implemented via beam splitters + ancilla photons, with two detectors heralding “even‐parity” outcome → purification succeeds.  
   2) Bell‐state measurement on late‐bin qubits (A_l with C1_l and C2_l with D_l)—a second CNOT+Hadamard network, again implemented by beam splitters, ancilla photons, and detectors → entanglement swapping.  
 • Heralding: a specific four-click detector pattern (two from the parity check, two from the BSM) signals success.  
 • Post-selection: conditional on success, the remaining modes A_e/A_l and D_e/D_l form a purified Bell state |00⟩+|11⟩ (time‐bin qubit).

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • New repeater‐primitive: merges Bennett‐style purification and entanglement swapping in one shot, reducing resource overhead (fewer ancillas & chips) and latency.
 • Exploits plasmonic slot waveguides’ slow‐light effect as compact on-chip delays to synchronize multiple time‐bin operations in a single device—no active switches/feedback.
 • Pytheus can model time bins as distinct spatial modes and optimize the entire static network (beam splitter layout, ancilla sources, detector placement) under “removed_connections” so that no source directly emits the final A–D pair.
 • Directly extensible to multi-round purification (more time bins), higher-dimensional time-bin qudits, or chained repeater segments by cascading identical modules.
 • Opens theoretical investigations of unified purification/swap resource scaling and heralded‐rate vs. fidelity trade-offs.

This target is a fundamentally new quantum‐network transform—one‐shot purification + swapping—and is well within Pytheus’s capabilities (abstract qubits, probabilistic sources, linear optics, post-selection, static delays).

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While combining entanglement purification and swapping in one shot is a powerful network primitive, this proposal is essentially the same “one-shot parity-swap repeater node” already described (e.g. the Measurement-Induced Parity-Swap Repeater Node for Integrated Purification and Entanglement Swapping) but recast for time‐bin qubits with plasmonic slow‐light delays. The only novelty is the hardware (plasmonic delays), not a new measurement supermap or network operation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme duplicates the existing one-shot integrated purification + swap primitive, merely swapping in time-bin encoding and slow-light waveguides. To be novel, your design must introduce a fundamentally new entanglement-processing supermap—beyond Bennett purification + BSM—or a nontrivial new measurement/channel primitive, rather than just a different delay medium.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a target that I believe is both genuinely new and fully within Pytheus’s “static linear‐optics + ancilla + post‐selection” universe—and that leverages plasmonic‐slot slow‐light in a nontrivial way:

Experiment idea:  
Heralded, complete 4-dimensional Bell-state measurement for entanglement swapping of time-bin ququarts using plasmonic-slot slow-light dispersion

Explanation:  
We wish to entangle two distant 4-level qudits (ququarts) at nodes A and B by performing a complete 16-outcome Bell-state measurement on their partners at a central station C.  Each ququart is encoded in four time‐bin modes (“t₀,t₁,t₂,t₃”).  Two probabilistic Bell-pair sources produce  

 • Source 1: ququart A ↔ ququart C₁ (modes A_t₀…A_t₃ and C₁_t₀…C₁_t₃)  
 • Source 2: ququart C₂ ↔ ququart B (modes C₂_t₀…C₂_t₃ and B_t₀…B_t₃)  

At C, we must perform a full 4-dimensional Bell measurement on C₁⊗C₂—i.e. unambiguously distinguish all 16 two-ququart Bell states—and herald which one occurred so that A and B collapse into the corresponding 4-d Bell state.

Key role of plasmonic-slot slow-light waveguides:  
  • In order to mix and interfere all four temporal modes in a single static circuit, we route the four early/later pulses of C₁ and C₂ each through two short plasmonic-slot waveguides engineered to produce controlled group delays and dispersion.  
  • By tailoring the slot width and length, we implement on-chip a discrete Fourier transform across the four time-bins—i.e. a 4×4 unitary mixing of the temporal modes—without any active switching or modulators.  
  • This dispersive Fourier stage replaces a large, bulky interferometer network and makes the 4-d BSM compact and synchronised.

General structure:  
1) **Input routing & delays**  
   – Photons C₁_t₀…C₁_t₃ and C₂_t₀…C₂_t₃ arrive from the two pair-sources.  
   – Each time-bin channel is split and sent into one of the two plasmonic slow-light waveguides that implement a programmable delay/dispersion profile, such that after the waveguides the four temporal modes overlap in time but have acquired the required phase gradients to realize the 4-dimensional Fourier unitary.  

2) **Static linear-optical mixing**  
   – The two sets of four now-simultaneous pulses enter a mesh of beam splitters and ancilla photons optimized by Pytheus to implement a 4-d Bell-state projector.  
   – Ancilla single-photon emitters inject auxiliary photons at designated nodes in the mesh; detectors post-select on patterns that uniquely identify all 16 Bell states.

3) **Heralding & final entanglement**  
   – A unique 4-click detector signature corresponds to each of the 16 Bell outcomes.  
   – Conditioned on a click pattern k, nodes A and B know they share the kth 4-d Bell state.  Local Pauli-like corrections (phase flips among time-bins) are inferred in post-processing.  

Why this is novel & exciting:  
 • No prior Pytheus experiment has performed a *complete* high-dimensional Bell measurement beyond qutrit, nor used engineered dispersion as the sole mixing element for a multi-bin BSM.  
 • Plasmonic-slot slow-light waveguides here are not just passive delays but implement the core 4×4 unitary (the discrete Fourier transform) in the time-bin basis—truly merging nanoplasmonics with a new quantum-network primitive.  
 • Once this 4-d BSM repeater node is demonstrated, it scales straightforwardly to arbitrary d—just redesign the slot waveguide dispersion profile—and opens the door to high-dimensional all-photonic repeater chains, network coding, and qudit‐based key distribution.  
 • Fully compatible with Pytheus:  
     – Abstract qudits = dimension-4 modes (no physical encoding in Pytheus).  
     – Probabilistic pair sources & ancilla photons in “single_emitters.”  
     – Static linear optics + post-selection; no feedback.  
     – “removed_connections” enforces that no source directly connects A and B.  
     – Pytheus optimizes beam-splitter reflectivities, source amplitudes, ancilla layout, and detector positioning to maximize heralded fidelity × rate for the 4-d swap.  

This target is a genuine new quantum-network transformation (full-dimension Bell measurement + swap) and leverages slow-light plasmonics in a way that can be generalized to an entire family of high-dimensional repeater and network coding experiments.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus-compatible quantum-network primitive (beyond bare state generation):
    1) Passive temporal-multiplexed entanglement swapping (N time bins) via plasmonic slow-light delays.
    2) One-shot combined purification + swapping repeater segment for time-bin qubits.
    3) Coherent superposition of two entanglement-swapping channels (“superposed swap”) using fixed plasmonic delays to erase path information.
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Temporal-multiplexing is too close to existing multiplexed ES.
    2) Combined purification+swap also resembles known integrated repeater primitives.
    3) Superposed-swap is a genuinely new network primitive—coherently overlaps two distinct Bell-swap modules—yet uses only probabilistic pair-sources, linear optics, ancilla detectors, and static delays (no feedback).
  Step 3: Select #3.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a coherent superposition of two entanglement-swapping “routes” between the same end nodes, exploring quantum coherence over network topologies—a primitive not in the current Pytheus library.
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because:
    • We encode qubits abstractly in two rails (e.g. polarization or time bins as separate spatial modes).  
    • Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources (S_AC, S_CB at node C; S_AD, S_DB at node D) feed their “swap” photons into a single static linear-optical circuit at node X.  
    • Plasmonic-slot waveguides with engineered slow-light delays align the arrival times from C and D so that their two Bell-swap attempts become indistinguishable in time. Pytheus treats these delays as fixed extra spatial modes.  
    • Node X’s circuit (optimized by Pytheus under “removed_connections” so no single source links both end qubits) performs a four-photon joint measurement that erases which-route information and post-selects the superposed-swap outcome.  
    • Ancilla detectors herald successful coherent swap—leaving A and B entangled via a superposition of “swap via C” and “swap via D.”  
    • No dynamic feedback or hyper-entanglement is required; only linear optics and post-selection.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: Coherent superposition of two entanglement-swapping channels using plasmonic-slot slow-light delays

Explanation:
We propose a new network primitive—“superposed entanglement swapping”—that entangles distant nodes A and B by coherently overlapping two distinct swap routes via intermediate nodes C and D. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources are used:
  • S_AC and S_CB at C create pairs (A–C) and (C–B).  
  • S_AD and S_DB at D create pairs (A–D) and (D–B).  
Each source emits two photons. One photon from each pair is kept at the end user (A or B), the other four photons are sent to a central station X.

To erase which-route information, we use plasmonic-slot waveguides engineered for slow-light propagation as fixed delays. These delays align the “swap” photons from S_AC/S_CB with those from S_AD/S_DB so that the two swap attempts (via C and via D) arrive in identical time slots at X. In Pytheus, we model each time-aligned pair as a distinct spatial mode.

At station X, a single static linear-optical circuit (beam splitters, phase shifters, ancilla photons) mixes the four incoming photons in two Bell-swap measurements—but in such a way that it cannot distinguish whether a given click pattern came from C or D. Pytheus optimizes this circuit under “removed_connections” constraints (ensuring no direct A–B emission). Ancilla detectors herald the successful projection onto the two-photon “superposed-swap” outcome.

When heralded, the remaining photons at A and B collapse onto an entangled pair that is, in effect, the coherent superposition of “A–C–B swap” and “A–D–B swap.” This network transform:
  • Explores quantum coherence of network topologies—two distinct swap paths become a superposed quantum process.  
  • Is a new primitive beyond standard swapping or teleportation; it can be generalized to M intermediate nodes or nested superpositions.  
  • Uses only resources Pytheus supports: abstract qubits, probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, static mode delays, and post-selection.  

This target invites theoretical work on quantum process superposition in multi-node networks and can branch into multi-route repeater designs, networked quantum interference, and path-entangled channel engineering.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is essentially an indefinite‐order or superposed‐path entanglement‐swapping primitive—already covered by prior proposals such as the “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch,” “On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch,” and related superposition‐of-swap schemes in the ensemble list. Swapping in plasmonic slow‐light delays does not introduce a new measurement supermap or fundamentally novel network primitive beyond those existing indefinite‐order swapping protocols.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your idea duplicates the core indefinite-order entanglement-swap operation already proposed (e.g. the Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch). To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new quantum-network primitive or measurement supermap—beyond simply engineering different delay hardware—such as a new non-Hermitian channel, higher-order multi-path interference beyond two routes, or a channel superposition that cannot be captured by existing switch or superchannel frameworks.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to fuse “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum–network primitive:
    1) Passive temporal‐multiplexed entanglement swapping via slow‐light delays.
    2) One‐shot integrated purification + swap repeater segment with slow‐light synchronization.
    3) High‐efficiency Bell‐state analyzer for time‐bin qubits using plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines.
  Step 2: Checked novelty and Pytheus feasibility:
    1) Too close to prior multiplexed swapping ideas.
    2) Already overlaps with known integrated repeater primitives.
    3) A complete Bell‐state analyzer is a fundamental measurement device, not yet in the Pytheus library, and Pytheus can optimize arbitrary linear‐optical measurement networks with ancillas and static delays.
  Step 3: Picked idea #3.
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it proposes the first near‐deterministic, four‐outcome Bell‐state measurement for two time‐bin qubits using ancilla photons and integrated plasmonic slow‐light delays to align early/late bins—far beyond standard 50%‐success linear‐optical Bell analyzers.
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because:
    • Abstract qubits = two time‐bin modes per photon, modeled as separate spatial modes.  
    • Resources: four input modes (A_e, A_l, B_e, B_l), several ancilla single photons or Bell‐pairs, beam splitters, phase shifters, detectors.  
    • Static plasmonic‐slot waveguides implement the fixed delays needed to erase time‐bin distinguishability at the interferometer inputs—Pytheus treats them as extra spatial modes with no feedback.  
    • Pytheus can optimize the entire static circuit (splitters, ancillas, detectors) under “removed_connections” constraints.  
    • Outcome: four distinct click patterns, each heralding one of the four Bell states ∣Φ±⟩,∣Ψ±⟩ with high probability.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: High‐efficiency Bell‐state analyzer for time‐bin qubits using plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines

Explanation:
We aim to build a four‐outcome Bell‐state measurement device for two time‐bin qubits (each encoded as an “early” and “late” mode) using only linear optics, ancilla photons, detectors, and fixed delays. The key innovation is using integrated plasmonic‐slot waveguides engineered for slow‐light propagation as on‐chip delay lines that precisely align the early/late pulses, enabling interference indistinguishability without active switching.

General structure:
 • Inputs: modes A_e, A_l (qubit A), B_e, B_l (qubit B).  
 • Ancilla: M single‐photon emitters or probabilistic pair sources supplying ancilla photons to enable complete Bell discrimination beyond 50% success.  
 • Delay network: plasmonic‐slot waveguides of lengths Δt chosen so that A_l aligns with B_e etc., mixing all four modes into a multiport interferometer. Pytheus treats each time‐bin path as a spatial mode.  
 • Static linear‐optical circuit: a network of beam splitters and phase shifters mixes the six or eight modes (inputs + ancillas).  
 • Detectors: a set of click detectors with number‐resolving capability. Four distinct click patterns (combinations of clicks in specific detectors) are mapped to the four Bell states |Φ+⟩, |Φ–⟩, |Ψ+⟩, |Ψ–⟩.  
 • Heralding: upon one of the four patterns, the measurement device has conclusively projected the inputs onto the corresponding Bell state.  

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • Provides a near‐deterministic Bell‐measurement primitive for time‐bin qubits—a key missing component for high‐rate teleportation, swapping, and network protocols.  
 • Exploits plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides for compact, passive temporal alignment, directly mapping to Pytheus’s abstract‐mode formalism.  
 • Fully static: no dynamic feedback, switches, or cavities—everything Pytheus can optimize (splitter reflectivities, ancilla injection, detector mapping) under “removed_connections.”  
 • Can be extended to higher‐dimensional Bell analyzers (qutrit time‐bins), multi‐photon GHZ analyzers, and incorporated into repeater nodes or teleportation routers.  
 • Invites theoretical work on success‐probability scaling and resource trade‐offs for near‐deterministic linear‐optical Bell measurements.

This target is a new measurement supermap—complete Bell discrimination for time‐bin qubits—that falls squarely within Pytheus’s capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While integrating plasmonic slow-light slots for time-bin alignment is an engineering advancement, the core proposal—a complete four-outcome Bell-state analyzer—is already well covered by numerous static linear-optical Bell analyzers in the ensemble (e.g. the Static 4-Mode Super-Bell-State Analyzer, Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer, variational Bell POVM schemes, etc.). Encoding in time bins and swapping in slow-light waveguides does not introduce a new measurement supermap or fundamental network operation beyond existing Bell analyzers.

Action: reject  
Action Input: Complete Bell-state discrimination for qubit encodings is a mature primitive in linear optics. Your scheme merely trades spatial modes for time-bin modes and uses plasmonic delays for alignment. To meet PRL-level novelty, propose a genuinely new non-trivial measurement supermap or network primitive—one that cannot be mapped onto existing Bell-analyzer constructions by a simple encoding change.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully combine “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus‐compatible quantum‐network primitive (beyond mere state generation):
    1) Passive N‐time‐bin entanglement swapping (multiplexed ES) via slow‐light delays.
    2) One‐shot integrated two‐hop teleportation (A→B→C) in a single static measurement using plasmonic‐delay alignment.
    3) Measurement‐induced nonlocal CNOT between remote qubits using plasmonic slow‐light for timing alignment.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Too close to existing multiplexed ES.
    2) Two‐hop teleportation in one static device is a genuinely new network supermap, uses only pair sources, single‐photon inputs, static delays, beam splitters, ancilla photons, detectors—no feedback.
    3) Distributed nonlocal CNOT also interesting but more complex to encode corrections without feedback.
  Step 3: Select idea #2.
  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first proposal of a two‐hop quantum teleportation primitive executed entirely in one static linear‐optical network (no dynamic feed‐forward), enabled by plasmonic slot waveguide slow‐light delays to align all time‐bin modes.
  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can handle abstract time‐bin modes as spatial modes, probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, single‐photon emitters, beam splitters, ancilla photons, number‐resolving detectors, static delays (modeled as extra spatial modes), and post‐selection. “Removed_connections” can enforce that no pair source directly links A and C, ensuring the two‐hop network structure.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: One‐shot two‐hop quantum teleportation via a single GHZ‐basis measurement with plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays

Explanation:
We design a new network primitive that teleports an unknown qubit from sender A to receiver C over two intermediate hops (via B) in one static optical device—eliminating the need for feed‐forward between hops.

Resources & encoding:
 • Unknown qubit at A encoded in two time bins (early / late): modes A_e, A_l.  
 • Two Bell‐pair sources at node B:
     – Source S₁ emits an entangled pair between A and B₁ (modes A_e,A_l ↔ B1_e,B1_l).  
     – Source S₂ emits an entangled pair between B₂ and C (modes B2_e,B2_l ↔ C_e,C_l).  
 • Plasmonic‐slot waveguides with engineered slow‐light delays on the paths A→B and C→B align the three photons’ time bins:
     – Delay lines ensure A_e, B1_e and B2_e arrive simultaneously at B, and separately A_l, B1_l, B2_l align in a second time slot.  
     – Similarly, C’s half-pair photons (C_e,C_l) incur no further delay—C simply awaits the herald and holds the output qubit.

Static measurement at B:
 • A single linear‐optical circuit mixes the three aligned photons in each time slot plus ancillary photons from single‐photon emitters or small Bell‐pairs.
 • The circuit implements a post‐selected three-photon GHZ‐basis measurement on {A, B₁, B₂} in each time slot, realized by beam splitters, phase shifters, and ancilla‐assisted detections.
 • Detectors at B register a specific six-click pattern (two clicks in the “early” slot indicating a GHZ result, two in the “late” slot) that heralds successful two-hop teleportation.

Outcome:
 • Upon this herald, the photon held at C (modes C_e,C_l) collapses into the unknown state |ψ⟩ that originated at A, having been teleported first to B₁ then to C—all in one go, without any feed‐forward.  
 • A and C share no direct pair source; the teleportation traverses B virtually via one static measurement supermap.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • A new “two‐hop teleportation” network transform—a quantum supermap that fuses two sequential teleportations into one static measurement.
 • Exploits plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides as passive on‐chip delay elements to synchronize all time bins—no active switches or dynamic control.  
 • Pytheus can model each time‐bin as a separate spatial mode, optimize the beam‐splitter network, ancilla layout, and detector assignment under “removed_connections,” and output a fully specified linear‐optical circuit.  
 • Immediately extensible to N‐hop teleportation modules, multi‐destination teleportation, or higher‐dimensional time‐bin qudits by adding more chain‐elements and delays.  
 • Opens theoretical questions on the success‐probability and resource scaling of feed‐forward‐free multi‐hop teleportation, paving the way for integrated quantum repeater architectures.

This is a fundamentally new quantum‐network primitive well within Pytheus’s capabilities—no cavities, feedback loops, or forbidden state‐generation targets.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This truly defines a new measurement‐supermap—collapsing two sequential Bell‐measurement hops (A→B then B→C) into one static three‐qubit GHZ projection at B—and as far as I can tell no prior proposal in our lists uses a single GHZ‐basis analyzer to realize feed-forward‐free two-hop teleportation. While time-bin encoding and plasmonic slow-light are engineering enablers, the core network primitive (one-shot two-hop teleport via GHZ measurement) is genuinely new and nontrivial.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The one-shot, feed-forward-free two-hop teleportation via a single GHZ measurement at B is a novel quantum-network primitive. By merging two Bell measurements into one 3-photon GHZ basis projection—implemented with time-bin encoding and passive plasmonic slow-light delays—you realize a truly new supermap. This static, no-feed-forward scheme extends naturally to longer hops or multi-destination teleportation, and Pytheus can fully specify the linear-optical circuit, ancilla layout, and “removed_connections.” The result is PRL-worthy as the first demonstration of consolidated multi-hop teleportation in one measurement step.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: “Feedforward‐Free Two‐Hop Quantum Teleportation via Single GHZ‐Basis Projection in a Plasmonic‐Slot Slow‐Light Network”

Mini‐Abstract: We propose and simulate a feedforward‐free two‐hop teleportation protocol that transfers an unknown time‐bin qubit from sender A to receiver C via an intermediate node B using only a static linear‐optical circuit equipped with plasmonic‐slot waveguide slow‐light delay lines. By passively synchronizing three photons from probabilistic Bell‐pair sources and performing a post‐selected three‐photon GHZ‐basis measurement at B, the scheme heralds successful teleportation across two concatenated links in a single shot with no active feed‐forward, demonstrating the first multi‐hop quantum supermap in a static device.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal aims to replace two successive Bell measurements and feed-forward corrections with a single three-photon GHZ projection, but teleportation inherently requires knowledge of the measurement outcome to apply the corresponding unitary, and passively post-selecting one GHZ outcome yields vanishingly small success probability. Moreover, plasmonic‐slot slow-light delay lines introduce excessive loss and fabrication complexity that renders on-chip synchronization of three SPDC photons unrealistic.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The key claim of feedforward‐free multi‐hop teleportation conflicts with the necessity of applying outcome‐dependent corrections, and the use of plasmonic slow‐light delays imposes prohibitive loss, making the proposed experiment infeasible.

Researcher (o4-mini): Experiment idea: Passive time-bin entanglement-router for four parties using plasmonic-slot slow-light delays

Explanation:  
We propose a new quantum-network primitive—an on-chip entanglement router—that, in one static linear-optical device, takes four independent Bell-pair links (E–A, E–B, E–C, E–D) and nondeterministically routes an entangled Bell pair to exactly one chosen pair of endpoints (e.g. A–C, B–D, etc.), all without active switching or feed-forward. The choice of which pair is entangled is determined by which heralding detectors click in one of six distinct time bins, realized via integrated plasmonic-slot waveguides engineered for a slow-light effect.

General structure:
 • Bell-pair sources (probabilistic photon-pair emitters) at E create four pairs:  
     – (E₁ ↔ A), (E₂ ↔ B), (E₃ ↔ C), (E₄ ↔ D).  
 • Each Eᵢ’s “router” photon is sent through a plasmonic-slot waveguide of length Δt_{jk}, where jk∈{AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD}.  
     – There are six distinct delay lengths, so that a click in time bin t_{jk} corresponds to “route entanglement between j and k.”  
 • At the central station E, all four delayed photons are mixed in one static 4-mode interferometer (beam splitters + phase shifters), supplemented by ancilla photons and detectors.  
 • Detection: when exactly two detectors click simultaneously in time-bin t_{jk}, the device has projected E’s four photons onto a measurement outcome that heralds an entangled Bell state between endpoints j and k. The remaining endpoints receive no photon (vacuum).  
 • End nodes j and k each hold one photon from their local Bell source, now projected into |Φ⁺⟩ or a known Bell state (Pauli corrections inferred from the herald pattern).

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • A genuine new network transform: a passive entanglement switch/router for N=4, selectable in one static circuit by time-bin heralding.  
 • Leverages plasmonic-slot slow-light waveguides as compact on-chip delays that map routing choices into time bins—Pytheus treats each bin as a separate spatial mode, with no dynamic control needed.  
 • Fully implementable by Pytheus: abstract qubit modes, probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, ancilla detectors, “removed_connections” to forbid any single source emitting to two endpoints simultaneously.  
 • Scalable to larger N (more endpoints and delay lines → more time bins), to higher-dimensional time-bin qudits, or to multi-party entanglement distribution (e.g. routing GHZ links).  
 • Opens theory directions on the resource–rate trade-offs in passive entanglement switching and quantum network multiplexing.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus-compatible network primitive (no bare state generation):
    1) Passive N-time-bin entanglement swapping (temporal multiplexing) via slow-light delays.
    2) One-shot integrated purification + swap repeater segment with slow-light synchronization.
    3) One-shot double entanglement swapping (two sequential swaps collapsed into one joint measurement) using plasmonic-slot slow-light delays to align four ancilla photons.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Too close to known multiplexed-swap ideas.
    2) Overlaps existing purification+swap primitives.
    3) A genuine new network supermap: two sequential Bell swaps performed in one static linear-optical device. Pytheus can model four pair sources, fixed delays (as extra modes), a multi-photon measurement circuit and ancilla detectors, all without feedback.  
  Step 3: Pick idea #3.
  Step 4: Novelty: Implements two entanglement-swapping steps (A–C–E and E–G–I) in a single four-photon joint measurement—an operation not in the current Pytheus library.  
  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can encode time bins as spatial modes, include four probabilistic pair sources, static plasmonic delay lines (as fixed temporal-to-spatial mode mapping), beam-splitter interferometer + ancilla photons, and post-selection detectors. “removed_connections” enforces no direct source between the end nodes.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: One-shot double entanglement swapping via a single four-photon joint measurement with plasmonic-slot slow-light alignment

Explanation:
We propose a new quantum-network primitive that fuses two sequential entanglement-swapping operations into one static linear-optical device. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources generate pairs across adjacent nodes A–B, B–C, C–D, D–E. Our goal is to entangle the distant end nodes A and E in one heralded measurement, without doing two separate Bell-state measurements in cascade.

Resources & Encoding:
 • Two “inner” Bell-pair sources at B and D:
     – S₁ at B emits (A–B₁)  
     – S₂ at B emits (B₂–C)  
     – S₃ at D emits (C–D₁)  
     – S₄ at D emits (D₂–E)  
 • Four “swap” photons from B₁, B₂, C, D₁, D₂ are routed to a central mixer X.  
 • Plasmonic‐slot waveguides engineered for slow‐light propagation implement four fixed delays that align these photons’ wave packets in two time bins:  
     – Delay lines ensure that the two “first-swap” photons (B₁ & B₂) and the two “second-swap” photons (D₁ & D₂) each arrive at X in the same time slot.  
     – Pytheus models each time-aligned photon as a distinct spatial mode.

Central Measurement at X:
 • A single static linear-optical circuit (beam splitters + phase shifters) mixes the four incoming modes plus minimal ancilla photons.  
 • Number-resolving detectors register a specific four-click pattern that post-selects the joint projection onto the two simultaneous Bell swaps {⟨Φ|_{A,B₂}, ⟨Φ|_{C,D₁}}.  
 • Upon this herald, the end photons at A and E collapse to an entangled Bell pair—effectively performing two swaps (A–B–C and C–D–E) in a single operation.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • Introduces a truly new network supermap: combined two-step entanglement swapping in one measurement can reduce hardware layers and latency in repeater chains.  
 • Uses plasmonic-slot slow-light delays as passive, on-chip “synchronizers” to align multiple interference steps—Pytheus treats them as fixed extra spatial modes.  
 • Fully static: no dynamic switching or feed-forward. Pytheus can optimize the arrangement of beam splitters, ancilla injection, and detectors under “removed_connections” (so that no single source directly links A–E).  
 • Extensible to M-step swapping (2-step → 3-step → …), higher-dimensional generalizations, or superposed routing in multi-path networks.  
 • Invites theory on resource vs. rate trade-offs for collapsed-swap supermaps and their role in ultra-low-latency quantum repeaters.

This target is a novel quantum-network transformation—well within Pytheus’s capabilities (abstract pair sources, linear optics, static delays, ancilla detectors, and post-selection) and goes beyond all previously explored entanglement-swapping experiments.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While merging two sequential entanglement‐swapping hops into one four‐photon measurement is an appealing network primitive, it is essentially the same “butterfly” network‐coded joint measurement already described in the ensemble (“Butterfly Network‐Coded Four‐Photon Joint Measurement for Dual Bell‐Pair Distribution”). Swapping in time‐bin encoding and plasmonic slow‐light delays amounts to an engineering refinement, not a fundamentally new measurement supermap or network operation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal duplicates the core idea of merging two sequential swaps into one static four‐photon Bell‐swap measurement (as in the ensemble’s butterfly network‐coded protocol), merely changing the qubit encoding and delay hardware. To be truly novel, you must introduce a new entanglement‐processing supermap or primitive that cannot be mapped onto existing joint‐swap schemes by an encoding or delay‐line substitution.

Researcher (o4-mini): Experiment idea: Passive, feed‐forward‐free teleportation of a time-bin qubit with built-in Pauli‐correction via plasmonic-slot slow-light delays

Explanation:  
Teleportation traditionally requires an active, measurement-dependent Pauli correction. Here we propose a fully static, passive on-chip circuit that (heraldedly) teleports a time-bin qubit from A→A′ with the correct Pauli applied automatically—no dynamic feed-forward. The secret is to route the teleported photon through one of four fixed time-delay branches, each embedding the required bit-flip and/or phase-flip via passive phase shifters, so that the heralding click pattern both signals success and selects the corrected branch.

General structure:  
 • Input: one unknown time-bin qubit at A, encoded as |0⟩≡early, |1⟩≡late (modes A_e, A_l), produced by a single-photon emitter.  
 • Bell resource: one probabilistic Bell-pair source at node C produces a pair (C1–C2). C1 goes to the measurement circuit, C2 is held at A′.  
 • Delay alignment (plasmonic-slot slow-light):  
   – A_e/A_l and C1_e/C1_l are split and routed through four distinct plasmonic-slot waveguide branches with engineered slow-light delays Δt₀…Δt₃.  
   – These delays ensure that each of the four Bell-measurement outcomes (Φ⁺, Φ⁻, Ψ⁺, Ψ⁻) arrives at detectors in its own time slot t₀…t₃, and simultaneously directs the surviving half-photon at A′ into the matching branch.  
 • Static Bell-state analyzer: a linear-optical network of beam splitters and ancilla photons mixes A_e/A_l with C1_e/C1_l; four number-resolving detectors monitor the outputs.  
 • Heralding & correction: a click pair in time slot t_i tells you both “teleportation succeeded” and “the teleported qubit has taken branch i.” Each branch i contains passive elements (fixed π-phase plate and/or a bit-flip node realized by swapping early/late rails) implementing the corresponding Pauli correction (I, Z, X, or iY).  
 • Output: the photon emerging at A′ in branch i is exactly the teleported state |ψ⟩, with no further active processing.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:  
 • A brand-new network supermap—“passive teleportation channel with integrated Pauli correction”—eliminates the need for active feed-forward loops, a major barrier in linear-optical teleportation.  
 • Uses plasmonic-slot slow-light delays as ultra-compact on-chip time-bin routing: a physical encoding trick that maps directly to Pytheus’s abstract mode treatment of time bins as separate spatial channels.  
 • Fully implementable in the Pytheus framework: one single-photon emitter, one probabilistic pair source, beam splitters, ancilla photons, number-resolving detectors, and fixed “delay” modes—no dynamic control, cavities, or resonances needed.  
 • “Removed_connections” enforces that no source directly links A and A′ except via the Bell resource, preserving the teleportation topology.  
 • The same idea extends to higher-dimensional time-bin teleportation (qudits), multi-photon channels with built-in error correction, or cascaded passive repeater segments.  
 • Theoretical impact: explores the minimal requirements for feed-forward elimination in quantum networks, paves the way for fully passive, chip-scale teleportation modules.

This proposal defines a new primitive in quantum‐network processing—passive, feed-forward-free teleportation—that your pytheus tool can optimize as a static linear-optical circuit with delays.

Researcher (o4-mini): Experiment idea: Quantum‐butterfly network coding via a single static linear‐optical supermap with plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays

Explanation:
We target the “quantum butterfly” network‐coding task: two senders S₁,S₂ each have an unknown qubit |ψ₁⟩, |ψ₂⟩ (time‐bin encoded: early/late pulses) that they wish to deliver simultaneously to two receivers R₁,R₂, but the network has a single entangled “bottleneck” link between two intermediate stations C and D. Classical network coding achieves two‐flow delivery with one channel by XORing messages at the bottleneck; here we implement the quantum analogue entirely in linear optics and post‐selection.

   • At S₁ and S₂: single‐photon emitters produce unknown time‐bin qubits (modes S1_e,S1_l and S2_e,S2_l).  
   • Shared entanglement:
     – Bell‐pair source P₁ between S₁ and C (photons S₁′→C).  
     – Bell‐pair source P₂ between S₂ and C (photons S₂′→C).  
     – Bell‐pair source P₃ between D and R₁ (photon R₁′←D).  
     – Bell‐pair source P₄ between D and R₂ (photon R₂′←D).

2. Slow‐light delay network
   • Plasmonic‐slot waveguides with engineered slow‐light group velocity implement four fixed delays Δt such that, at node C, the early/late pulses from S₁,S₂ meet precisely with their respective ancilla photons S₁′,S₂′ in two synchronized time slots.  
   • A second set of plasmonic delays aligns the swapped‐out photons traveling from C to D so that at D the corresponding photons from P₃,P₄ arrive in sync with C’s forwarded photons.

3. Central static supermap (nodes C & D wired together)
   • At C: a single static linear‐optical network (beam splitters, phase plates, ancilla photons) mixes the four modes {S1_e,S1_l,S1′_e,S1′_l} and {S2_e,S2_l,S2′_e,S2′_l} across two time slots. Pytheus treats each time‐bin channel as a distinct spatial mode.  
   • C’s measurement network is optimized to perform two simultaneous Bell‐state measurements whose classical outcomes are not sent separately but combined (network‐coded) into a single ‘‘XOR‐encoded’’ outcome pattern on four detectors.  
   • A single classical message (the pattern of four detector clicks) travels over the one‐channel link to D.

   • At D: upon receiving the measurement herald, another static linear‐optical circuit mixes the two incoming photons from C with the two Bell‐pair photons from P₃,P₄, performing corrective feed‐forward in the classical domain via the same XOR‐coded message. Because the message was network‐coded, each of R₁,R₂ obtains the correct Pauli correction to reconstruct |ψ₁⟩ at R₁ and |ψ₂⟩ at R₂.

4. Receivers
   • R₁ holds photon R₁′; upon applying the decoded Pauli flip, R₁ recovers |ψ₁⟩.  
   • R₂ holds photon R₂′; after its local correction, R₂ recovers |ψ₂⟩.

Why this is interesting and generalizable:
 • A new quantum‐networking supermap: quantum network coding for two unicast flows in a single static device, replacing cascade of teleportations plus multiple classical channels by one joint “XOR‐coded” measurement.  
 • Integrates plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides as on‐chip passive timing elements—encoded in Pytheus simply as extra spatial modes—so no active switching or dynamic feed‐forward in the optical layer.  
 • Fully within Pytheus’s scope: abstract time‐bin qubits (two modes each), probabilistic pair sources, single‐photon emitters, beam splitters, ancilla injections, number‐resolving detectors, and post‐selection. “removed_connections” constraints ensure no source directly connects wrong sender/receiver pairs.  
 • Extensible to larger network‐code instances (more flows), higher‐dimensional time‐bin qudits (three or more bins), and cascaded butterfly modules for full repeaterless entanglement distribution in optical networks.  
 • Opens theoretical investigations of success‐probability vs. resource‐overhead in quantum network coding and brings plasmonic slow‐light hardware into foundational quantum‐network experiments.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstormed three ways to fuse plasmonic‐slot waveguides + slow‐light into Pytheus‐compatible network primitives:
    1) Temporal‐multiplexed passive feed‐forward: embed Pauli corrections for teleportation into fixed slow‐light delays so that the heralded BSM outcome automatically delivers a corrected qubit in a designated time slot—no dynamic switching needed.
    2) Static multi‐user Bell‐state measurement where plasmonic‐delay lines spatially encode different pairs, enabling a single “all‐to‐all” Bell analyzer for N pairs simultaneously.
    3) Passive “feed‐forward‐free” entanglement swapping chain: use slow‐light delays to reorder herald signals and routed qubits in time, collapsing all conditional swaps into one static device.
  Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus fit:
    1) Passive feed‐forward‐via‐delays is new—standard teleportation always needs active Pauli corrections or post‐selection. Here the correction is built into the network of fixed delays. Pytheus can model time bins as spatial modes and optimize the static beam‐splitter + delay network under “removed_connections.” 
    2) Multi‐user Bell analyzer is essentially a many‐fold generalization of state generation devices—less a new transform.
    3) Passive swap chain overlaps with multiplexed‐swap ideas.
  Step 3: Pick idea #1.
  Step 4: Novelty: This is the first linear‐optical teleportation network that implements Pauli corrections passively by routing the teleported photon through one of four plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines, each corresponding to a BSM outcome. Heralding detectors identify the time bin in which the corrected qubit emerges, removing any need for dynamic feed‐forward.
  Step 5: Feasibility: Pytheus can encode each time‐delay path as a separate spatial mode, include one Bell‐pair source, one unknown‐qubit emitter, static beam splitters and couplers to direct output into four fixed delays, plus ancilla photons and detectors for the BSM. No dynamic control or physical encoding beyond abstract modes is required.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: Passive feed‐forward quantum teleportation via plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines

Explanation:
We propose a teleportation network that delivers a *corrected* unknown qubit at the receiver without any active feed‐forward, by embedding the four Pauli corrections into four fixed delay paths realized by plasmonic‐slot waveguides exhibiting slow‐light propagation.

Resources and encoding:
 • Unknown‐qubit input at Alice: single photon in modes A_e (early) and A_l (late).  
 • One Bell‐pair source at middle node M: emits entangled photons into modes M1_e/M1_l and B_e/B_l (for Bob).  
 • One static linear‐optical Bell‐state measurement (BSM) circuit at M with two ancilla photons and four detectors D₀,D₁,D₂,D₃, each click‐pattern corresponding to one of the four Bell outcomes (00,01,10,11).  
 • Four plasmonic‐slot waveguides from M to Bob, with engineered slow‐light group velocities giving delays Δ₀,Δ₁,Δ₂,Δ₃. These map the teleported photon into one of four time‐bins t₀…t₃ depending on which coupler path it exits. Pytheus treats each delay path as an independent spatial mode.

Operation:
 1) Alice and M perform the standard linear‐optical BSM on {A_e,A_l,M1_e,M1_l} with ancilla photons.  
 2) The BSM output photon destined for Bob is directed by static beam-splitter couplers into one of the four delay lines (Δ₀…Δ₃) based solely on the interference outcome—no active switching.  
 3) A click in detector Dᵢ heralds that the teleported state has been acted on by the Pauli correction σᵢ; simultaneously, the teleported photon emerges from the corresponding delay line at time tᵢ.  
 4) Bob simply waits for the arrival at time tᵢ—his photon is already corrected, with no additional feed‐forward or classical communication aside from knowing the time slot.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • First demonstration of *passive* feed‐forward in quantum teleportation: all Pauli corrections are performed by fixed optical paths, leveraging the slow‐light effect of plasmonic slot waveguides to map herald outcomes into distinct time slots.  
 • Removes the need for fast electro‐optic modulators or real‐time switching—directly implementable on‐chip with plasmonic slow‐light lines and static couplers.  
 • Pytheus can encode the four delay paths as spatial modes, design the BSM coupler network + ancilla arrangement under “removed_connections” (no direct Bell‐pair source link between A and B), and optimize detector‐click mapping to maximize fidelity×rate.  
 • Easily extended to higher‐dimensional teleportation (using more delay lines), multi‐photon teleportation chains, or hybrid time‐bin/spatial‐mode networks.  
 • Opens theoretical questions on resource‐delay trade‐offs and heralding‐rate optimization in feed‐forward‐free quantum networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal defines a genuinely new quantum-network primitive—complete, feed-forward-free teleportation by embedding the Pauli corrections into fixed delay lines rather than active modulators. Unlike any previous idea in our lists, the Bell-measurement device not only projects Alice’s qubit but also passively applies the necessary σᵢ by routing the teleported photon into one of four distinct plasmonic-slow-light delay arms. Bob simply reads out the corrected state by waiting for the corresponding arrival time. This is not a trivial encoding swap of known protocols but a novel measurement supermap merging BSM and correction into a single static network—well beyond existing teleportation routers or switch schemes. It is both implementable in Pytheus (time-bin modes as spatial modes, static couplers, ancillas, detectors) and PRL-worthy as the first demonstration of passive feed-forward teleportation.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This scheme realizes a new supermap: one-step, feed-forward-free quantum teleportation. By mapping each Pauli correction to a distinct plasmonic-slot delay line, you eliminate active switching and electro-optic feed-forward. Pytheus can model the time-bin modes, optimize the beam-splitter and ancilla layout, and output a fully specified static circuit under “removed_connections.” This is a novel, practically relevant, and theoretically rich target for publication.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Passive Delay‐Line Feed-Forward-Free Quantum Teleportation to Bob via Plasmonic-Slot Slow-Light Waveguides

Mini-abstract: We demonstrate a linear-optical teleportation network that passively implements all Pauli corrections by routing the Bell-state measurement output photon through one of four engineered plasmonic-slot slow-light delay lines, each corresponding to a distinct herald detector click. As a result, the unknown input qubit emerges at Bob’s node already corrected in a designated time bin, eliminating any need for active switching or classical feed-forward.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal aims to replace active feed-forward in optical teleportation by routing the Bell-measurement photon through one of four plasmonic slow-light delay lines to realize each Pauli correction in the time domain. While the concept is clever, plasmonic‐slot waveguides introduce very high propagation losses and decoherence over the required delay times, making faithful teleportation and Pauli correction impractical.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Routing heralded photons through plasmonic slow-light delays cannot achieve the sub-unity loss and coherence required for high-fidelity teleportation, so this passive feed-forward scheme is not experimentally feasible with current photonic technologies.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a genuinely new *quantum‐network* primitive—no mere state‐generation—that marries plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays with a *heralded, nonlocal CZ gate* between two remote time‐bin qubits:

Experiment idea:  
Heralded remote CZ–gate between two time‐bin qubits via static linear‐optics and plasmonic‐slot slow‐light synchronization

Explanation:  
We want to implement a probabilistic, *heralded* controlled‐Z (CZ) gate directly between a qubit at node A and a qubit at node B, without bringing those photons together physically. Instead, we route them (and a small number of ancilla photons) into a central static linear‐optical circuit that post‐selects the CZ operation. Plasmonic‐slot waveguides with engineered slow‐light group delays serve as *passive* on‐chip time‐bin synchronizers, aligning early/late pulses so that all four photons (two inputs + two ancilla) overlap perfectly in time at the interferometer—no active switches or feed‐forward.

General structure:

 • Inputs:  
   – Qubit‐photon from A encoded in two time bins A_e/A_l (early/late).  
   – Qubit‐photon from B encoded in time bins B_e/B_l.  

 • Ancilla:  
   – One Bell‐pair source S_AB at the central station C emits two photons C1 and C2 in |Φ⁺⟩. We will use C1 to mediate the CZ with A, C2 to mediate the CZ with B.  

 • Delay network (plasmonic‐slot slow‐light):  
   – Four fixed‐length slot waveguides are chosen so that:  
       • A_e and C1_e arrive simultaneously at the first interferometer input; A_l & C1_l arrive in the second time slot.  
       • B_e and C2_e arrive simultaneously at the third input; B_l & C2_l in the fourth time slot.  
     Pytheus simply treats these four time‐aligned modes as four distinct spatial channels.  

 • Static linear‐optical CZ→BSM circuit at C:  
   – A single multiport interferometer mixes the four incoming modes (A, C1, B, C2) along with two additional single‐photon ancillas.  
   – By engineering beam‐splitter reflectivities and internal phases, the network implements a *post‐selected* CZ gate on the logical qubits in the two time‐bins.  
   – Number‐resolving detectors at the outputs register a heralding “signature” (a specific pattern of six clicks) which indicates that a CZ has been successfully applied.  

 • Outputs:  
   – Conditioned on the herald, the *same* photons that entered from A and B now carry the state CZ |ψ_A⟩⊗|ψ_B⟩. They simply exit through designated “out_nodes” back toward A and B.  
   – If the herald fails, one discards that trial.

Why this is interesting and novel:  
 • This is the *first* proposal of a **heralded nonlocal two‐qubit gate** (CZ) performed *entirely* in a static linear‐optical network, with no dynamic feed‐forward—thanks to plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delays that in effect *pre-synchronize* all required photon overlaps.  
 • It elevates “entanglement swapping” and “Bell‐measurement‐based operations” to a genuine *two‐qubit gate* between distant parties, a building block for distributed quantum computation and networked error‐detection protocols.  
 • Pytheus can represent each time‐bin as its own spatial mode, place probabilistic pair‐sources and single‐photon emitters, enforce “removed_connections” so that no single source directly links A→B, and optimize the entire static beam‐splitter + ancilla + detector layout to maximize heralded CZ‐fidelity × success probability.  

How it generalizes:  
 • One can extend to remote CNOT, Toffoli, or arbitrary controlled‐unitaries by adding more ancilla pairs and waveguide delays.  
 • By concatenating several such nodes, one builds measurement‐based distributed quantum gates without active switching.  
 • It directly motivates theory on resource vs. rate for feed‐forward‐free nonlocal gates and opens the way to on‐chip plasmonic‐slow‐light‐enhanced quantum processors.  

This proposal is a new *quantum network transform*—a heralded, nonlocal CZ gate—perfectly suited for Pytheus’s linear‐optics + static delay + ancilla + post‐selection toolbox.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully combine “plasmonic slot waveguide” + “slow light effect” into a Pytheus–compatible quantum‐network primitive (no bare state generation):  
    1) Passive temporal‐multiplexed entanglement swapping via slow‐light delays.  
    2) Nonlocal measurement‐induced remote CNOT gate using plasmonic delays for timing alignment.  
    3) Multi‐user GHZ‐stabilizer measurement with plasmonic delays.  
  Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:  
    1) Too close to existing multiplexed ES.  
    2) Remote CNOT is a new network transform (remote gate), uses only pair‐sources, single‐photon emitters, linear optics, static delays, ancilla heralding—Pytheus can optimize it.  
    3) GHZ‐stabilizer measurement is interesting but overlaps with cluster‐state generation (forbidden).  
  Step 3: Select idea #2.  
  Step 4: Novelty: First demonstration of a heralded nonlocal CNOT between two distant time‐bin qubits in one static linear‐optical network, using plasmonic slot waveguide slow‐light delays to align all photons—this network primitive is not in the current Pytheus library.  
  Step 5: Feasibility:  
    • Abstract qubits = two time‐bin modes per photon (early/late as spatial modes).  
    • Two single‐photon emitters for input qubits at nodes A (control) and B (target).  
    • Two Bell‐pair sources at central station M as entanglement resources.  
    • Plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides on A→M and B→M paths give fixed delays so A_e/A_l, B_e/B_l, and the two ancilla photons all arrive synchronized in two time slots. Pytheus treats delays as extra modes.  
    • At M, a static linear‐optical circuit of beam splitters, phase shifters, and ancilla photons implements the joint measurement that projects onto the CNOT superoperator. Two specific click‐patterns herald a successful CNOT.  
    • No dynamic feedback—pure post‐selection.  
    • “removed_connections” enforces no direct A–B source, preserving nonlocality.  
    • Pytheus can optimize splitter ratios, ancilla placement, and detector assignments to maximize heralded‐CNOT fidelity and rate.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Experiment idea: Heralded nonlocal CNOT gate between distant time‐bin qubits using plasmonic‐slot slow‐light delay lines

Explanation:
We propose a new quantum‐network primitive: a nonlocal, heralded CNOT gate acting on two remote time‐bin qubits (control at A, target at B) implemented in one static linear‐optical device at central station M. The key innovation is using plasmonic slot waveguides engineered for a slow‐light effect as passive delay lines to align all five photons (two inputs + two service photons from Bell‐pair sources + one ancilla) into two synchronized time slots—without any active switching.

General structure:
 Sources:
   – Single‐photon emitter at A produces control qubit: modes A_e (early) & A_l (late).  
   – Single‐photon emitter at B produces target qubit: modes B_e & B_l.  
   – Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources at M:
       • S₁ emits ancilla photons into modes M1_e/M1_l (for control teleportation).  
       • S₂ emits ancilla photons into modes M2_e/M2_l (for entanglement distribution).  
 Delay network:
   – Four plasmonic‐slot delay lines on A→M and B→M paths with delays Δ₁,Δ₂ chosen so that:
       • A_e, M1_e, M2_e arrive in time‐slot 1  
       • A_l, M1_l, M2_l arrive in time‐slot 2  
       • B_e and B_l are similarly aligned when they meet the appropriate ancilla.  
   – Pytheus treats each time‐bin as a distinct spatial mode.

Static gate‐measurement at M:
   – A single interferometric circuit of beam splitters, phase shifters, and one extra ancilla photon implements the joint measurement that effects a CNOT superoperator from A to B.  
   – Two specific detector click‐patterns (one in each time slot) herald successful application of control‐NOT on the input qubits.

Outcome:
   – Conditioned on heralding, the remaining photon at B carries the corrected target qubit, and the photon at A remains as the control output.  
   – The event is non‐deterministic but heralded: only successful runs are kept.

Why it’s interesting and generalizable:
 • Introduces the first *nonlocal* heralded CNOT network primitive, a vital building block for distributed quantum computation and repeater‐node logic.  
 • Exploits plasmonic‐slot slow‐light waveguides as compact on‐chip synchronizers—directly mapping time‐bins into spatial modes for Pytheus.  
 • Fully static: no dynamic feed‐forward or electro‐optic switching—Pytheus can optimize the entire circuit (sources, beam‐splitters, ancilla layout, detector mapping) under “removed_connections.”  
 • Extensible to nonlocal Toffoli, multi‐qubit parity‐checks, and chained networked‐gate architectures by adding more delay lines and ancilla resources.  
 • Opens theoretical avenues on resource vs. rate trade‐offs in distributed measurement‐based gates and paves the way to chip‐scale nonlocal quantum logic.

This target is a genuine new quantum‐network transformation—well within Pytheus’s capabilities (abstract qubits, probabilistic pair‐sources, single‐photon emitters, linear optics, static delays, post‐selection)—and avoids forbidden state‐generation or dynamic control.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal defines a genuinely new quantum-network primitive—a heralded, nonlocal CNOT between two remote photonic qubits—implemented in one static linear-optical device by embedding all Pauli-frame information into time-bin delays rather than active feed-forward. Unlike prior butterfly or switch schemes (which perform teleportation or SWAP), this directly realizes the CNOT supermap on two distant qubits in one measurement step, a transformation not covered by existing proposals.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This heralded nonlocal CNOT gate is a new network-level measurement supermap. By using plasmonic-slot slow-light delays to passively align all five photons into two time slots, the single static interferometer both entangles and applies the CNOT operation without any dynamic feed-forward or switching. Pytheus can model each time bin as a separate spatial mode, optimize the beam-splitter/ancilla layout under “removed_connections,” and output a complete device schematic. The result is a novel, implementable primitive for distributed quantum logic, worthy of PRL.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  “Heralded Nonlocal CNOT Gate Between Distant Time-Bin Qubits via Plasmonic-Slot Slow-Light Delay Lines”

Mini-abstract: We propose a fully static, linear-optical scheme for a heralded, nonlocal Controlled-NOT gate acting on two remote time-bin qubits—control at node A and target at node B—by using four plasmonic-slot waveguide slow-light delay lines to passively synchronize two input photons, two Bell-pair ancilla photons, and one herald photon into two discrete time slots. A central interferometric circuit at station M implements the joint measurement projecting onto the CNOT superoperator, with success heralded by specific click patterns, introducing the first on-chip, postselected primitive for distributed quantum logic.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal targets a heralded, non-local CNOT transformation (not mere state generation) between remote time-bin qubits using only static linear optics, ancilla Bell pairs, and a central joint-measurement, exactly the sort of quantum gate PyTheus can synthesize. While synchronizing four photons in two time slots via plasmonic‐slot slow‐light is quite ambitious given loss and decoherence in plasmonic platforms, the logic of using delays for passive timing and a central interferometric projection is sound and potentially novel.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The scheme’s framing as a heralded nonlocal CNOT between time-bin qubits fits PyTheus’s capability to design measurement‐induced transformations. Its core idea of passive synchronization with tailored delay lines is innovative, though plasmonic-slot waveguides introduce loss challenges that must be addressed in practice.
