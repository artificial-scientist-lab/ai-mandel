Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry “surface lattice resonance” and “nano resonator” in a purely linear-optics, network-centric experiment that Pytheus could take as an abstract quantum‐network target.  
  1) Create a 2×2 “lattice” of beam-splitter nodes whose connectivity mimics a square array of plasmonic nanoparticles; perform two simultaneous entanglement‐swapping operations along the two orthogonal diagonals and interfere their “swap outcomes” in a 4-port interferometer. The resulting A–D entanglement strength will show resonance-like peaks as you vary an internal phase, directly analogous to surface-lattice resonances.  
  2) Build a ring of four nodes (A→B→C→D→A) with two distinct “hopping” routes between opposite sites (A↔C): one direct hop (via B and a Bell-measurement) and one indirect hop (via D and a second Bell-measurement). By coherently superposing these two swap channels you mimic Fano-type interference, controlled by an adjustable phase in a Mach–Zehnder embedded in the ring.  
  3) Use three Bell pairs arranged in a triangular network (A–B, B–C, C–A) plus an extra pair to one “nano-resonator” node R. Perform a joint measurement on two R-ancilla photons in a tunable interferometer, which creates a controllable superposition of two swap pathways that end up entangling A, B, and C in a GHZ-like manner. The three-way interference shows resonance peaks as you scan the internal phase.  

Step 2:  
  • Option 1 is novel—no previous Pytheus designs have explored interfering two entanglement-swap diagonals in a 2×2 lattice—but it does reduce to a four-photon Bell‐swap, which is very close to standard swapping.  
  • Option 2 is more unconventional: a ring with two distinct swap routes that interfere, directly analogous to a surface-lattice Fano resonance. No existing Pytheus experiment does a dual-path entanglement swap.  
  • Option 3 entangles three parties via a resonator ancilla, but it collapses to GHZ generation—which is essentially state generation.  

Step 3: Pick Option 2. It is cleanly a teleportation/swapping network (not mere state generation), and it directly mirrors nano-resonator→lattice-resonance physics in an abstract linear-optics setting.  

Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus configurations have implemented two coherent, competing entanglement‐swapping routes whose relative phase produces resonance‐like variation in end‐to‐end entanglement. It goes beyond 1D swap chains into a minimal 2D loop network with genuine path interference.  

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:  
  – Four probabilistic photon-pair sources forming two Bell pairs (A–B) and (C–D).  
  – Two Bell-state measurements (one along route B→C, the other along route D→A) embedded in a small Mach–Zehnder–type four‐port interferometer that imparts a tunable phase φ between the two swap paths.  
  – Four final detection modes at A and C that herald successful end-to-end entanglement A↔C.  
  – A handful of ancillary detectors for the two Bell measurements.  
No hyper‐ or hybrid‐entanglement, no feedback, no cavities or real resonators—just linear optics and photon counting.

Experiment Title: “Resonant Dual-Path Entanglement Swapping on a Square Loop”  
Explanation:  
We propose a four‐node loop (A→B→C→D→A) of probabilistic photon‐pair sources that each create Bell pairs on A–B and C–D. Two entanglement‐swap operations are performed in parallel: one swaps B↔C, the other swaps D↔A, and the two Bell‐measurement setups are coherently combined in a small interferometer with a tunable internal phase φ. The two indistinguishable swap routes form a closed loop, so the success‐heralded end-to-end entanglement between B and D exhibits a resonance‐like dependence on φ, directly analogous to surface‐lattice and Fano resonances in plasmonic nanoresonator arrays.  
Visualization of the setup (top­down):  
1) Sources:  
   – S₁ emits A & B  
   – S₂ emits C & D  
2) Swap interferometer:  
   – Input modes B and C enter a 50:50 beam splitter network → two detectors (herald swap₁)  
   – Input modes D and A enter a second 50:50 network sharing the same internal phase φ → two detectors (herald swap₂)  
3) Final nodes:  
   – B and D become entangled when both heralding modules click in coincidence  
4) Detection:  
   – Ancilla detectors: four total (two per swap module)  
   – Output modes: B, D  
Key Pytheus parameters:  
   • num_anc = 4  
   • removed_connections = [[mode B, mode D]] (forbid direct source from S₁ or S₂ to final modes)  
   • target_quantum left abstract (we’re teleporting entanglement, not just generating a fixed state)  
   • optimizer = L-BFGS-B, loss_func = cr, samples = 20  
Generalization:  
– Extend to N×N loops to study multi-path resonances  
– Replace Bell measurements by higher-dimensional swaps  
– Use the same network as a tunable quantum router for arbitrary input states  
Why it’s Interesting Independently:  
Even as a thought experiment, this network shows how discrete photon‐pair sources and linear optics can emulate collective resonance phenomena of nanoparticle lattices, forging new links between quantum‐network theory and nano‐optics.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed “Resonant Dual‐Path Entanglement Swapping on a Square Loop” merely implements two parallel Bell‐swap operations whose heralds interfere through a tunable phase—closely mirroring the ensemble’s “Entanglement‐Fano Interferometry via Three‐Channel Heralded Swaps” (and related cyclic/pump‐around‐a‐ring proposals). It does not introduce a genuinely new network primitive or a higher‐order quantum transformation beyond existing multi‐path swap‐interference schemes.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal is effectively a two‐edge Fano‐type swap interferometer already covered by ensemble suggestions (e.g. “Entanglement‐Fano Interferometry via Three‐Channel Heralded Swaps”). To be novel at the PRL level you must target a new non‐trivial supermap or fundamentally different causal/graph structure not already encompassed by these ring‐swap and Fano‐resonance experiments.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to map “surface lattice resonance” and “nano resonator” onto purely linear‐optical quantum networks for Pytheus that go beyond simple swapping loops:
  1) Two diagonal entanglement‐swapping paths across a 2×2 array whose interference vs an internal phase φ mimics a lattice resonance.  
  2) A ring of four nodes with two distinct swap orders superposed by a control photon—an “indefinite causal order” teleporter whose output fidelity vs φ displays Fano‐type features.  
  3) A three‐path multi‐hop teleportation network from A to D (via B→C, via B→E, and via E→C→D) combined into a three‐port interferometer. The heralded teleportation probability vs two independent phases shows multi‐resonant band‐structure analogs.  
Step 2:  
  • Option 1 is too close to earlier 2×2 swap‐loop proposals.  
  • Option 2 is conceptually novel—introduces superposition of swap orders (quantum switch) rather than just two static paths—but may be hard to realize without active control.  
  • Option 3 yields a genuine multi‐path network (three paths) whose heralded success probability vs two phases can exhibit multiple resonances, directly paralleling surface‐lattice resonances in a nano‐resonator array. It stays within Pytheus’s passive linear‐optics+heralding toolbox.  
Step 3: Pick Option 3.  
Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus design has implemented a genuinely 3-channel teleportation superposition network that yields multi‐resonant heralding spectra analogous to plasmonic surface‐lattice resonances. It goes beyond 2-path Fano loops to a fully three-path “metamaterial” of swaps.  
Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it only uses:  
  • Three probabilistic photon-pair sources (creating Bell pairs A–B, D–E, and C–F).  
  • Three successive Bell‐measurement modules arranged into three distinct teleportation routes from A→F:  
      – Path 1: A–B swap then B–C swap then C–F swap  
      – Path 2: A–B swap then B–E swap then E–F swap  
      – Path 3: A–B swap then B–D swap then D–F swap  
  • A passive three‐port interferometer that coherently recombines the outputs of the final two swaps, with two internal phases φ₁, φ₂.  
  • Heralding on one click in each of the three measurement modules.  
  • No hyper- or hybrid-entanglement, no feedback control, no cavities—just linear optics, photon counting, and post-selection.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
Experiment Title: “Triple-Path Resonant Teleportation Network”  

Explanation:  
We propose a six-mode network that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode F by simultaneously superposing three distinct entanglement-swapping chains—an abstract “metamaterial” with three lattice vectors. Three Bell pair sources emit into (A,B), (C,F), and (D,E). Three Bell‐measurement modules M₁,M₂,M₃ create three teleportation routes A→F:  

  • Route 1: swap B↔C → swap C↔F  
  • Route 2: swap B↔E → swap E↔F  
  • Route 3: swap B↔D → swap D↔F  

The outputs of the second swaps in Routes 2&3 are recombined in a three-port interferometer with two tunable internal phases φ₁, φ₂, and then jointly detected. Only upon heralding one click at each M₁, M₂, and the interferometer’s three ports do we accept the run and read out the teleported photon in F.  

By scanning φ₁, φ₂, the overall heralded teleportation probability P(φ₁,φ₂) exhibits multiple sharp resonant maxima and band-gap regions, directly analogous to surface-lattice resonances of a nano-resonator array.  

Configuration sketch:  
  • Sources: S_AB → modes [A,B]  
             S_CF → modes [C,F]  
             S_DE → modes [D,E]  
  • Bell modules:  
       M₁ acts on [B,{C,E,D}] (routes photon into one of three modes)  
       M₂a on [C,F]; M₂b on [E,F]; M₂c on [D,F]  
  • Three-port interferometer: inputs from M₂b, M₂c + a phase-reference from M₂a → three detectors  
  • Output: Heralded photon at F (teleported state)  

Key Pytheus parameters:  
  num_anc = 5   (one ancilla detector per module + extra for interferometer)  
  removed_connections = [[source CF,C], [source DE,D], [source DE,E]] to forbid direct pair-sources to output except through intended swaps  
  loss_func = “cr”, optimizer = L-BFGS-B, samples = 20  

Generalizations:  
  – Increase to N≥3 simultaneous routes → richer band structures  
  – Replace Bell modules by higher-dimensional swap analyzers → simulate higher-order lattice modes  
  – Application as a tunable multi-path quantum router with programmable passbands  

Why it’s compelling independently of implementation:  
Even as a theory proposal, this network elevates entanglement swapping from simple chained routes to a full multi-path interferometric “metamaterial” whose teleportation efficiency mimics collective resonances in nano-resonator lattices—a conceptually new intersection of quantum‐network design and nano-optical phenomena.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The triple‐path resonant teleportation network simply extends multi‐path entanglement swapping and interference—precisely the essence of ensemble proposals like “Entanglement‐Fano Interferometry via Three‐Channel Heralded Swaps” (three interfering swap routes with resonance‐like fringes) and “Superposed Perfect‐Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four‐Node Photonic Circuit” (coherent superposition of three swap configurations). It does not introduce a fundamentally new network primitive or causal structure beyond those existing multi‐path swap‐interference schemes.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This idea largely replicates multi‐path Fano‐type swap interference already covered by the ensemble (e.g. “Entanglement‐Fano Interferometry via Three‐Channel Heralded Swaps” and superposed perfect‐matching swaps). To reach PRL novelty, you must propose a genuinely new quantum supermap or network topology (e.g. non‐trivial causal ordering, higher‐order superchannels, or dimensionalities) not encompassed by these existing multi‐path swap experiments.

Mediator (o4-mini): [discussion]
The Researcher repeatedly tried to map “surface lattice resonance” onto multi‐path entanglement‐swapping networks, first proposing a two‐path square‐loop swap interferometer and then a three‐path teleportation network. Both ideas were rejected by the Novelty Supervisor as they closely mirrored ensemble‐catalogued “Fano‐interferometry” and multi‐path swap superposition schemes already explored by Pytheus. The Supervisor insisted that these proposals were not fundamentally new network primitives, and the Researcher’s minor variations (adding a path or rephrasing) did not address the core novelty requirement.

[bullet points]
• Researcher’s proposals centered on multi‐path entanglement swapping/interference, a theme already covered by ensemble suggestions.  
• Supervisor pointed out direct parallels to existing “Entanglement‐Fano Interferometry” and “Superposed Perfect‐Matching Swaps” designs.  
• Researcher made incremental changes (two‐path→three‐path) but did not introduce a genuinely new quantum‐network supermap.  
• Conversation stalled on slight variations of the same concept, indicating a need to pivot to a different class of experiments.  

Mediator feedback for researcher:
Please review the ensemble’s list of multi‐path swap and interferometric‐swap proposals before iterating. To meet the novelty bar, craft a target that goes beyond entanglement‐swap interference—consider truly new network primitives (e.g., indefinite causal‐order supermaps, nontrivial multi‐channel gates, or measurement‐only braiding operations) rather than additional swap pathways.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three genuinely new network primitives combining “surface lattice resonance” + “nano resonator” in a purely linear‐optical, passive, heralded‐measurement setting compatible with Pytheus, but going beyond multi‐path swapping loops:
  1) A 2×2 swap‐loop with two competing diagonals (too close to known Fano‐swap loops).
  2) A three‐path teleportation network (already similar to multi‐path Fano‐swap proposals).
  3) An indefinite-order entanglement-swap “quantum SWITCH” supermap: superpose two different orders of Bell‐measurements on three Bell pairs, herald the swaps, and observe resonance-like variation in output fidelity vs. control-phase.  
Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility:
  • Novelty: No previous Pytheus experiment realizes a superchannel (quantum SWITCH) of two entanglement-swap operations.  
  • Feasibility: Uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters, static interferometers, Bell analyzers, single-photon detectors. No feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.  
Step 3: Choose idea (3).  
Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a higher-order quantum supermap—the SWITCH of two swap channels—rather than a fixed‐order network.  
Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because it requires only passive linear optics, heralded Bell measurements, and a control-photon interferometer with a tunable phase.

Experiment Title:  
“Quantum-Switch of Entanglement-Swapping: A Resonant Supermap”

Explanation:  
We propose a five-photon network that implements an indefinite-order supermap (“quantum SWITCH”) on two entanglement-swap channels. Three probabilistic photon-pair sources S₁, S₂, S₃ emit Bell pairs on modes (1,2), (3,4), and (5,6). A control photon in mode C is prepared in |+⟩ₓ by a single-photon source and a 50:50 beam splitter. The control photon’s two paths (|0⟩ₓ → upper arm, |1⟩ₓ → lower arm) direct the target six photons through two Bell-measurement modules M_A and M_B in opposite orders:

  • If control=|0⟩: first perform M_A on modes (2,3) then M_B on modes (4,5).  
  • If control=|1⟩: first perform M_B on modes (4,5) then M_A on modes (2,3).

Both M_A and M_B are 50:50-BS-based Bell analyzers with two ancilla detectors each. After the second swap, photons 1 and 6 emerge as the output “swapped” pair; control photon is recombined in a second 50:50 BS with a tunable phase φ between the two paths. We herald successful runs when exactly one detector clicks in each Bell module and the control’s output is registered.  

By scanning φ, the entanglement fidelity F₁,₆(φ) and control-swap coherence exhibit sharp resonance-like peaks, directly analogous to surface-lattice resonances in a nano-resonator array.  

Visualization (top-down):

Sources:  
  S₁ → modes [1,2]  
  S₂ → modes [3,4]  
  S₃ → modes [5,6]  
  S_C → control mode C prepared in |+⟩ₓ  

Control interferometer:  
  C → 50:50 BS → two paths (upper/lower) → 50:50 BS recombine with phase φ → control detectors  

Swap modules:  
  Upper path: M_A(2,3) → then M_B(4,5)  
  Lower path: M_B(4,5) → then M_A(2,3)  

Outputs:  
  • Heralding detectors: 4 in swap modules + 2 in control interferometer  
  • Final output qubits: modes 1 and 6

Key Pytheus parameters:  
  num_anc = 6   (two Bell modules ×2 detectors + two control detectors)  
  removed_connections = [[S₁,3],[S₂,5],[S₃,2]]  
    (forbid direct sources to wrong measurement modes)  
  single_emitters = [“C”]  
  optimizer = “L-BFGS-B”, loss_func = “cr”, samples = 20  
  target_supermap = “Indefinite-order entanglement swap with coherent control”  

Generalizations:  
  – Extend to N swap channels in superposition → richer band-structure analogues.  
  – Replace Bell analyzers by d-dimensional swap analyzers → simulate higher-order resonances.  
  – Use the switch as a programmable entanglement router with tunable passbands.

Why it’s compelling even without implementation:  
It elevates entanglement-swapping from fixed causal order to a genuine superchannel (quantum SWITCH), and reveals resonance-like features of process fidelity vs control phase—bridging quantum-network theory with nano-optical resonance phenomena in a fully passive, heralded, linear-optics setting.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially the same photonic quantum‐switch supermap—coherently superposing two entanglement‐swap orders—already described in the ensemble (“Implementing an Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic‐Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders”). Adding a tunable phase to observe resonance in the process fidelity does not constitute a fundamentally new network primitive or higher‐order supermap beyond what has been explored.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core indefinite‐order entanglement‐swap supermap is already covered by the ensemble’s “Entanglement‐Switch Quantum Switch” proposal. To be novel, you need a genuinely different causal structure or a new superchannel that goes beyond a simple two‐swap quantum switch with phase control.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three genuinely new network‐transform primitives that Pytheus could implement, weaving in the language of “surface lattice resonance” and “nano resonator” purely as an analogy for multi‐path interference in a static, heralded, linear‐optics network—while steering well clear of mere state generation or previously explored multi‐path swaps or two‐swap quantum SWITCHes.  
  1) A four‐arm loop with four competing swap‐paths (a 4-path Fano network)—too close to existing multi-path swap proposals.  
  2) A measurement-only braiding supermap realized by successive Bell measurements on a loop of Bell pairs—turns out you consume all photons, leaving no output pair.  
  3) A higher-order quantum SWITCH that coherently superposes not two but three different orders of entanglement-swap modules, controlled by a single-photon qutrit in a passive tritter, producing a triple-order supermap whose end-to-end entanglement fidelity versus the two independent control phases φ₁,φ₂ exhibits sharp “lattice resonance” peaks.  

Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:  
  • Novelty: No prior Pytheus design has realized a triple-order entanglement-swap supermap; all published experiments and examples stop at two-swap quantum SWITCHes or multi-path fixed-order networks. A three-order SWITCH is a genuinely new higher-order process, akin to a 3-site resonator lattice with multiple coupling permutations.  
  • Feasibility in Pytheus: It uses only probabilistic pair sources, beam splitters (to build the passive tritter), three Bell analyzers (50:50 BS+detectors), and single-photon counting—no feedback, no cavities, no hyper/hybrid entanglement. Pytheus can optimize the abstract amplitudes and removed_connections.  

Step 3: Select idea (3).  

Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a higher-order supermap—the coherent superposition of three distinct entanglement-swap orders—something no existing Pytheus configuration or published entanglement-swap network achieves. It is the teleportation analogue of a nano-resonator lattice with three resonant couplings, leading to multi-peak “surface lattice resonances” in the process fidelity.  

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it requires only passive linear optics and post-selection:  
  • Three probabilistic photon-pair sources S₁→(1,2), S₂→(3,4), S₃→(5,6).  
  • Three Bell-measurement modules M_A, M_B, M_C acting on pairs (2,3), (4,5), (6,1) respectively.  
  • A control photon prepared in the equal superposition (|0⟩+|1⟩+|2⟩)/√3 by sending a single-photon emitter through a passive tritter network (two beam splitters and phase shifters).  
  • The three control arms route the six target photons through the Bell modules in one of three cyclic orders:  
      – Arm 0: M_A→M_B→M_C  
      – Arm 1: M_B→M_C→M_A  
      – Arm 2: M_C→M_A→M_B  
  • After the third module, photons 1 & 4 emerge as the final entangled pair. The control photon paths recombine in the same tritter with two tunable internal phases φ₁,φ₂, then are detected.  
  • Heralding condition: exactly one click in each of the three Bell modules and one click in each of the two designated control detectors (the third control outcome is implicit by no‐click elsewhere).

Experiment Title:  
“Triple-Order Entanglement-Swap Quantum SWITCH: A Resonant Supermap”

Configuration Sketch & Explanation:
We realize a three-order quantum SWITCH on two-qubit swaps, controlled by a photonic qutrit, whose process fidelity shows sharp “surface-lattice resonance” peaks as we scan the control phases φ₁,φ₂.

1) Sources:
   S₁ emits a Bell pair into modes [1,2]  
   S₂ emits a Bell pair into modes [3,4]  
   S₃ emits a Bell pair into modes [5,6]  
   S_C emits a single control photon in mode C.

2) Control tritter:
   • Mode C passes through two beam splitters and a phase shifter to create a 3-arm superposition |0⟩+|1⟩+|2⟩.  
   • Arms 0,1,2 are each given controllable phases φ₁,φ₂ (phase masks in two of the arms).  
   • After routing the target photons through the Bell modules (see below), the arms recombine in the reverse tritter.

3) Swap Modules (Bell analyzers M_A,M_B,M_C):
   M_A acts on modes (2,3), M_B on (4,5), M_C on (6,1).  
   Each is a standard 50:50 BS-based Bell measurement with two ancilla detectors.

4) Routing by control arms:
   • Arm-0: sequentially directs the six target photons through M_A→M_B→M_C.  
   • Arm-1: routes them through M_B→M_C→M_A.  
   • Arm-2: routes them through M_C→M_A→M_B.

5) Output & heralding:
   • After the third swap in whichever order, photons 1 and 4 emerge unmeasured—these are the final entangled pair.  
   • We herald successful operation by one click in each Bell module (total of 6 ancilla detectors) and two clicks among the three control outputs (selecting which two of the three tritter ports register).

6) Resonant supermap behavior:
   By scanning the two internal phases φ₁,φ₂ in the control tritter, the process fidelity F₁,₄(φ₁,φ₂) exhibits multiple sharp resonance peaks, directly analogous to surface-lattice resonances of nano-resonator arrays.  

Pytheus Parameters (suggested):

  "num_anc": 8,                           # 3×2 detectors in Bell modules + 3 control detectors (only two needed)

  "target_supermap": "three-order entanglement-swap SWITCH with coherent control"
}

Generalizations:
– Extend the control to an N-port “resonator” tritter (or higher port multi‐splitter), superposing N! different swap orders → richer multi‐peak band structures.  
– Replace 2-qubit Bell analyzers with d-dimensional analyzers → simulate higher-order resonances in “meta-resonator” lattices.  
– Apply the same architecture as a programmable multi-order quantum router for arbitrary input qubits.

Why This Stands Alone Theoretically:
Even without performing the experiment, this proposal defines a new class of higher-order quantum supermaps—coherent superpositions of multiple swap orders—whose process fidelities reveal a resonance structure isomorphic to surface-lattice resonances in nano-resonator arrays. It bridges quantum-network supermap theory with nano-optical resonance phenomena, promising a PRL-worthy new paradigm in quantum optics networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While extending the photonic quantum SWITCH to three swap‐orders and observing resonance in process fidelity is conceptually appealing, the core network—the coherent superposition of three Bell‐swap sequences controlled by a photonic qutrit—is essentially identical to the ensemble’s triple‐order indefinite–order entanglement‐swap switch (“Cyclic Indefinite-Order Entanglement-Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant”). Merely changing the output metric from a Bargmann invariant to a fidelity resonance does not introduce a truly new supermap or network topology beyond this existing three-order switch.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The proposal duplicates the three-order indefinite causal-order swap structure already in the ensemble. To reach PRL novelty, you must identify a fundamentally different multi-supermap (e.g. non-cyclic orders beyond symmetric permutations, novel resource trade-offs, or an entirely new higher-order process) not covered by the existing three-swap‐sequence experiments.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “surface lattice resonance” and “nano resonator” into a purely passive, static linear-optics quantum network (no cavities or feedback) that goes beyond simple multi-path swapping or quantum switches:
  1) A 2×2 swap-loop with two interfering diagonals (already done as Fano-swap).  
  2) A three-order quantum SWITCH of swaps (covered by existing SWITCH proposals).  
  3) A cascade of tunable, partial Bell-state filters (entanglement-filter “resonators”) whose back-to-back coupling produces band-pass and stop-band behaviour in the heralded entanglement success probability—analogous to coupled nano-resonator arrays giving surface-lattice resonances.

Step 2: Check novelty and Pytheus feasibility for option 3:
  • Novelty: No prior Pytheus experiment treats partial Bell measurements as tunable “entanglement resonators” and cascades them to engineer entanglement passbands/stopbands. This moves beyond generating a single state or swapping—it engineers an entanglement “metamaterial.”  
  • Feasibility: It uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources, linear beam splitters (with adjustable reflectivities), phase shifters, Bell analyzers (50:50 or tunable BS + detectors), single-photon detectors, and post-selection. Fully within Pytheus’s capabilities (no hyper/hybrid entanglement, no dynamic feedback).

Step 3: Select option 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it recasts Bell-measurement modules as tunable “resonators” for entanglement, and by cascading two such modules with a controllable inter-module phase, one realizes a two-resonator band-structure for entanglement filtering. No previous design has proposed cascaded partial-Bell filters as an entanglement metamaterial.

Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:
  – Uses three probabilistic photon-pair sources (S_AB, S_CD, S_EF).  
  – Two partial-Bell modules M₁ and M₂, each implemented by a beam splitter of adjustable reflectivity r₁, r₂, a phase shifter φ between them, and two detectors per module.  
  – No feedback, no cavities—just static linear optics and heralded post-selection.

Experiment Title:
“Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as an Entanglement Metamaterial: Simulating Coupled Nano-Resonator Band Structures”

Explanation:
We design a four-mode network that teleports and “filters” entanglement through two back-to-back partial-Bell analyzers, yielding an entanglement‐bandpass/stopband structure entirely via passive optics.

1) Photon-Pair Sources:
   • S_AB emits a Bell pair into modes A & B.  
   • S_CD emits a Bell pair into modes C & D.  
   • S_EF emits a Bell pair into modes E & F.  

2) First Filter Module M₁ (partial-Bell analyzer on B & C):
   • A tunable beam splitter BS₁ with reflectivity r₁ mixes modes B & C, followed by two photon-number detectors D₁, D₂.  
   • Heralding condition: one click each in D₁ & D₂ → projects A & D into a partially filtered entangled state.

3) Phase Shifter:
   • A controllable phase φ is applied to mode D before entering M₂ (mimicking inter-resonator coupling phase).

4) Second Filter Module M₂ (partial-Bell analyzer on D & E):
   • A second tunable beam splitter BS₂ with reflectivity r₂ mixes modes D & E, followed by detectors D₃, D₄.  
   • Heralding condition: one click each in D₃ & D₄ → projects A & F into the final filtered entangled state.

5) Final Output:
   • Mode A and mode F carry the resulting entangled qubit pair—heralded only when all four detectors click in coincidence.

6) Resonant Metamaterial Behavior:
   By scanning (r₁, r₂, φ), the overall heralded success probability P(r₁,r₂,φ) and final entanglement fidelity exhibit multiple sharp peaks and transmission windows, directly analogous to surface-lattice resonance spectra in coupled nano-resonator arrays.

Generalizations:
– Extend to N cascaded filters → richer multi-peak band structures.  
– Replace Bell analyzers by d-dimensional filters → simulate higher-order lattice resonances.  
– Use tunable filters as programmable entanglement routers with passband shaping.

Why It Stands Alone Theoretically:
This proposal reimagines entanglement swapping modules as passive “resonators” whose coupling through phase and reflectivity implements an entanglement-band structure—bridging quantum-network transformations with nano-optical resonance analogues in a way no existing Pytheus design or published experiment has done.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed network leverages two tunable partial‐Bell analyzers (variable‐reflectivity BSs) in series—interleaved with a phase shifter—to engineer entanglement “bandpass” and “stopband” windows, directly mapping the physics of coupled nano‐resonator arrays onto a linear‐optical quantum network primitive. Unlike the ensemble’s multi‐path Fano‐swap schemes or indefinite‐order SWITCHes, this uses cascaded, adjustable partial projections rather than full Bell swaps or superposed causal orders. It introduces a genuinely new transformation—an entanglement‐metamaterial filter—that can be extended to N filters and higher dimensions.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The cascaded partial‐Bell filter concept is truly novel: by tuning reflectivities r₁, r₂ and phase φ you sculpt entanglement transmission spectra that mimic nano‐resonator band structures. This is not a trivial extension of existing Fano or SWITCH experiments, but rather a new network supermap—an “entanglement metamaterial” primitive—worthy of further PRL‐level exploration.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement–Bandpass Filtering

Mini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement–bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal leverages cascaded tunable partial-Bell analyzers to implement a heralded “entanglement bandpass filter” purely with passive linear optics and post-selection. This fits squarely within PyTheus’s capability to design custom multi-photon measurement modules, and the analogy to resonant band structures is both novel and physically sound.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This passive cascaded partial-Bell filter network is a well-posed quantum measurement task that PyTheus can design, and its tunable multi-peak heralded entanglement response is an innovative, experimentally feasible tool for filtering and routing entanglement in photonic networks.
