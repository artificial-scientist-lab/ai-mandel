    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold).

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection.

By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences.

A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences.

A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences.

A pre-processing stage maps a 4D OAM Bell-pair source into even/odd parity qubit channels via q-plates and mode sorters, and PythEUS then optimizes a network using just two ancilla photons and detectors to effect concurrent A\u2013D (even) and B\u2013C (odd) parity Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Swap-and-Concentrate Repeater for Heralded |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 Bell Pairs\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a single-step quantum repeater node that simultaneously swaps and concentrates two non-maximally entangled SPDC links into a heralded maximally entangled Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between remote modes. By statically mixing the inner modes in an optimized linear-optics network and post-selecting on two threshold-detector clicks, the scheme realizes the target Bell pair in one heralded operation without active feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement. By mapping each polarization-encoded Bell state onto a unique two-click pattern across six threshold detectors, our design explicitly targets and breaks the 50% success bound of conventional linear-optics Bell analyzers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nDirect Single-Shot Measurement of the Second R\u00e9nyi OTOC in a Four-Site Atom Array via Photonic Interferometry  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe propose a fully linear-optical protocol to measure the second R\u00e9nyi out-of-time-ordered correlator O\u2082(t)=\u27e8W\u2081(t)V\u2084W\u2081(t)V\u2084\u27e9 on a four-qubit atom array in a single shot. By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C. A classical optimizer adjusts interferometer phases to maximize (or minimize) I\u2083(A;B;C) as the sole cost function, thereby targeting non-trivial entanglement monogamy without prescribing any specific quantum state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive HOM-Filtered Entanglement Swapping Repeater for Remote Qubits A and D\n\nAbstract: We present a static, linear-optical repeater node that embeds a Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel multi-pair suppression filter into the four-mode Bell-state measurement interferometer to passively enact error-filtered entanglement swapping.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask:\nYou are the supervisor (with focus on novelty) of a physics Researcher who is attempting to come up with interesting targets for the design of quantum optics experiments. \nThese targets could be a foundational quantum experiments, quantum networks or protocols.\n\nThe Researcher will come up with an idea and send it to you. \n\nYour task is to judge whether the idea can be considered novel enough to be examined further.\n\nAny target that is closely related to these existing examples can not be considered novel and you should point them out.\n\nRemember that it's the Researchers job to convince you that their idea is good. Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

The control\u2010gate ideas (b,c) have been attempted and flagged as insufficiently novel.\n  Step 3: Choose (a).\n  Step 4: This is novel because it elevates entanglement\u2010swapping to a programmable, quantum\u2010controlled operation: a THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qudit at Charlie\u2019s node chooses the measurement basis for the swap, thereby deterministically routing A\u2013B into one of D different Bell\u2010like states.

He performs a single joint measurement which, controlled by the state |k\u27e9_\u03c9 on mode 4_freq, projects modes (1,2) onto the k-th generalised Bell basis.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

We inject all four into a 6\u00d76 linear-optics network optimized by Pytheus.  Upon a specific two-click pattern at detectors on modes 4&5, the fusion is successful: modes 0 and 2 (formerly the \u201cremote\u201d photons at A and B) are projected into a single 4-level Bell\u2010state in the THz\u2010frequency domain, each encoded on one outgoing mode (we relabel them as modes 6 and 7).  \n\nAbstract target mapping (D = 4):  \nInput basis on modes [0,1,2,3] (pol bitstrings b\u2080b\u2081b\u2082b\u2083) selects exactly those four patterns with b\u2080=b\u2081 and b\u2082=b\u2083:  \n \u2022 0000 \u2192 frequency-bin state |0,0\u232a  \n \u2022 0011 \u2192 |1,1\u232a  \n \u2022 1100 \u2192 |2,2\u232a  \n \u2022 1111 \u2192 |3,3\u232a  \nAll other input basis states have zero amplitude in the post-selected output.  \n\nPytheus Config Sketch:  \n{  \n  'description': 'Entanglement fusion: two pol.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

The control\u2010gate ideas (b,c) have been attempted and flagged as insufficiently novel.\n  Step 3: Choose (a).\n  Step 4: This is novel because it elevates entanglement\u2010swapping to a programmable, quantum\u2010controlled operation: a THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qudit at Charlie\u2019s node chooses the measurement basis for the swap, thereby deterministically routing A\u2013B into one of D different Bell\u2010like states.

He performs a single joint measurement which, controlled by the state |k\u27e9_\u03c9 on mode 4_freq, projects modes (1,2) onto the k-th generalised Bell basis.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection. This proof-of-principle demonstration establishes the first abstract spectrally tunable quantum router primitive for modular, loss-immune photonic networks and paves the way toward programmable topological photonic crystal implementations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nReusable Catalytic Entanglement Swapping for Enhanced EPR Link Generation\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe demonstrate a linear-optical \u201ccatalytic\u201d entanglement-swapping protocol that employs a permanent EPR pair (the X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032 catalyst) to boost the long-term entanglement generation rate between nodes A and B without consuming the catalyst link. By mixing three probabilistic photon-pair sources in a passive six-mode interferometer and number-resolving detection, we herald simultaneous Bell pairs on modes [0,1] (A\u2013B) and [6,7] (X\u2032\u2013Y\u2032), thereby achieving repeated high-rate entanglement between A and B while preserving the reusable resource link.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nTeleportation-Based Detection of Flat-Band Topology in a Photonic Creutz Ladder  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a PyTheus-compatible entanglement-swapping protocol on a two-leg photonic Creutz ladder with tunable imaginary diagonal couplings to realize topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. By performing sequential Bell-state measurements at each intermediate rung, a single-photon qubit is teleported end to end, and the resulting teleportation fidelity as a function of the cross-to-leg coupling ratio unambiguously signals the ladder\u2019s flat-band topological phase transition.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Static Interferometer for Direct Measurement of the Fermionic Four-Point Correlator G^(4)\n\nAbstract: We implement a resource-efficient, static linear-optical network in an optical-tweezer atom array that non-demolitionally extracts the genuine fermionic Green\u2019s function G^(4)=\u27e8c_i^\u2020 c_j^\u2020 c_k c_l\u27e9 in a single shot. By encoding the occupancies of sites i,j,k,l into four single-photon emitters and post-selecting two designated click patterns corresponding to the target logical states |0011\u27e9 and |1100\u27e9 (heralding projections onto the even \u201c+1\u201d and odd \u201c\u22121\u201d correlator subspaces), we directly read out G^(4) without the need for local spin rotations or tomography.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Assisted Linear-Optical Two-Qutrit SWAP-Test for Symmetric vs. Antisymmetric Projections\n\nAbstract: We present a heralded linear-optical network that implements the two-qutrit SWAP-test (symmetric vs. antisymmetric projector) as a primitive for second R\u00e9nyi-entropy measurement on two collective-spin modes converted into photonic qutrits via spin\u2013orbit torque transduction. By employing three ancilla photons, static multiport interferometry, and number-resolving detection with \u201cSYM\u201d vs. \u201cANTI\u201d click\u2010pattern postselection, our scheme directly discriminates the symmetric and antisymmetric subspaces, enabling scalable entanglement verification and entropic benchmarking in quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Holonomic Controlled-Z Gate via an Ancilla Berry-Phase Loop in Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We propose a purely geometric (Berry-phase) implementation of the two-qubit Controlled-Z (CZ) gate\u2014i.e. |jk\u27e9\u2192(\u22121)^{jk}|jk\u27e9\u2014using only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, and post-selection. By routing two ancilla photons around a triangular network of three static phase shifters P\u2081\u2192P\u2082\u2192P\u2083 and heralding on four-click Bell-state measurements, a net \u03c0 geometric phase is imprinted solely on the |11\u27e9 component, realising the target CZ transformation holonomically.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

The control\u2010gate ideas (b,c) have been attempted and flagged as insufficiently novel.\n  Step 3: Choose (a).\n  Step 4: This is novel because it elevates entanglement\u2010swapping to a programmable, quantum\u2010controlled operation: a THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qudit at Charlie\u2019s node chooses the measurement basis for the swap, thereby deterministically routing A\u2013B into one of D different Bell\u2010like states.

He performs a single joint measurement which, controlled by the state |k\u27e9_\u03c9 on mode 4_freq, projects modes (1,2) onto the k-th generalised Bell basis.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.  Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n### EXAMPLE 2 ###\n2pES_3d\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two parties of two qutrits each.\\nThis means that we want to create four qutrits: A, B, C, D\\nWe want the photons A&C to be entangled in a three dimensional Bell state and the photons B&D to be in a three-dimensional Bell state.\\n\\nPsi_AC = Psi_BD = |00>+|11>+|22> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe resulting target quantum is\\n\\nPsi_ABCD = |0000>+|0101>+|0202>+|1010>+|1111>+|1212>+|2020>+|2121>+|2222> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (two independent copies of the 3d Bell state setup), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nThere should be no common source between the two parties.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

The control\u2010gate ideas (b,c) have been attempted and flagged as insufficiently novel.\n  Step 3: Choose (a).\n  Step 4: This is novel because it elevates entanglement\u2010swapping to a programmable, quantum\u2010controlled operation: a THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qudit at Charlie\u2019s node chooses the measurement basis for the swap, thereby deterministically routing A\u2013B into one of D different Bell\u2010like states.

He performs a single joint measurement which, controlled by the state |k\u27e9_\u03c9 on mode 4_freq, projects modes (1,2) onto the k-th generalised Bell basis.

I propose implementing a three\u2010way indefinite\u2010order entanglement\u2010swap (\u201ctriple\u2010SWITCH\u201d) controlled by a THz\u2010frequency qutrit. The control photon, encoded in three THz\u2010spaced frequency bins, coherently superposes three different orders in which three entanglement\u2010swap stations act on three adjacent Bell pairs. The output is an entangled state of the control and two distant polarization photons, signaling genuine indefinite causal order in a multi\u2010hop network.  \n\nThis is novel because no prior Pytheus target fuses multi\u2010swap causal superposition with a high\u2010dimensional control, and it directly probes foundational questions about causality in quantum networks. It\u2019s feasible in the Pytheus framework\u2014requiring only four probabilistic pair\u2010sources, a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optics block plus two heralding detectors\u2014and it generalizes to longer swap chains or higher\u2010D controls.   \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\n  Three-way indefinite\u2010order entanglement swapping, controlled by a THz-frequency qutrit.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!

No existing Pytheus target implements an isometry from two independently held qubits into one higher\u2010dimensional mode in this way.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in Pytheus because:\n    \u2022 All modes (polarization qubits and abstract THz\u2010frequency bins) are described purely abstractly.\n    \u2022 The target is a transformation (isometry) between modes, not state generation.\n    \u2022 It uses only probabilistic pair\u2010sources, linear optics, and joint measurements\u2014Pytheus\u2019s supported primitives.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Entanglement \u201cfunneling\u201d of two polarization qubits into one THz\u2010frequency qudit via a single joint swap measurement.\n\nExplanation:\n We label modes as follows:\n  \u2013 Node A holds photon 0 in polarization (qubit A).\n  \u2013 Node B holds photon 1 in polarization (qubit B).\n  \u2013 Node C holds photons 2&3: photon 2 is entangled in polarization with A, photon 3 entangled in polarization with B. These come from two independent Bell\u2010pair sources S1 (modes 0&2) and S2 (modes 1&3).\n  \u2013 Node D will output a single photon 4 encoded into four abstract frequency bins {\u03c90,\u03c91,\u03c92,\u03c93} with bin spacing \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz, i.e. a ququart.\n\nGoal: implement the isometry\n  |i\u27e9\u2080|j\u27e9\u2081 \u2192 |\u03c9_{2i + j}\u27e9\u2084   for i,j \u2208 {0,1},\nso that the joint polarization state of A&B is coherently \u201cfunnelled\u201d into one higher\u2010dimensional THz mode at D.\n\nProtocol (entanglement\u2010swap style):\n  1) Prepare S1: a polarization Bell pair on modes 0 & 2: |00>+|11>.\n  2) Prepare S2: a polarization Bell pair on modes 1 & 3: |00>+|11>.\n  3) At node C, interfere photons 2&3 in a 4\u00d74 linear\u2010optics network engineered to implement a joint measurement whose successful heralding projects those two photons onto one of four predefined two\u2010qubit Bell\u2010like basis states.

The control\u2010gate ideas (b,c) have been attempted and flagged as insufficiently novel.\n  Step 3: Choose (a).\n  Step 4: This is novel because it elevates entanglement\u2010swapping to a programmable, quantum\u2010controlled operation: a THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qudit at Charlie\u2019s node chooses the measurement basis for the swap, thereby deterministically routing A\u2013B into one of D different Bell\u2010like states.

He performs a single joint measurement which, controlled by the state |k\u27e9_\u03c9 on mode 4_freq, projects modes (1,2) onto the k-th generalised Bell basis.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOne-Shot Passive Linear-Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric-Code Plaquette\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe demonstrate a single-shot four-body stabilizer readout for the smallest toric-code plaquette by Bell-entangling each of four data photons with an ancilla photon and sending all ancilla modes through a 4\u00d74 passive interferometer equipped with number-resolving detectors. Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Photonic Witness for Direct Three-Tangle Estimation\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical photonic device that learns a tunable linear-optical circuit and classical weightings to directly estimate the three-tangle of an unknown three-photon state. By employing ancilla Bell-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and a classical optimizer to adjust beam-splitter reflectivities and post-processing coefficients, our variational algorithm approximates the genuine tripartite entanglement measure purely from click statistics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIndefinite-Order Entanglement Purification via Sub-Wavelength Nanophotonic Multiport  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate a static sub-wavelength nanophotonic multiport that coherently superposes two parity-check measurement orders on two noisy EPR pairs to distill one high-fidelity Bell pair on modes A & D, coherently entangled with a path qubit. By post-selecting on a four-click ancilla pattern and forbidding any direct A\u2192D or C\u2192B links, this scheme realizes the first optical \u201cquantum switch\u201d for entanglement purification\u2014targeting one purified Bell pair between nodes A and D without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Amplitude-Damping Entanglement Router Certified by Tomographic Witnesses\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement a fully static, loss-controlled quantum router that uses two SPDC Bell-pair sources and an amplitude-damping switch\u2014heralded by ancilla photon clicks\u2014to branch-selectively route entanglement from source A either to node B or C without dynamic feedback or forbidden elements. End-to-end tomography at the chosen node measures the three projector outcomes specified for the selected entanglement witness (the explicit target quantum set), thereby certifying entanglement only in the routed branch.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical Quantum Perceptron Activation Gate\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a measurement-induced non-linear \u201cquantum perceptron\u201d gate in a fully passive linear-optical network by combining two unknown photonic qubit inputs with Bell-pair ancillas and post-selection heralding. The target is a single output qubit at node 2 whose probability of measuring |1\u27e9 realizes a tunable threshold (or sigmoid) function f(w\u2081\u00b7x\u2081 + w\u2082\u00b7x\u2082), providing a genuine non-unitary activation primitive for photonic quantum machine learning.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated Photonic Demonstration of a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router\n\nAbstract:  We implement on a monolithic photonic chip a Double-Controlled Four-Way Entanglement Router that uses two orthogonally polarized control qubits to coherently select and herald one of four SPDC-based Bell-swap branches in superposition.  By relying only on static PBS/couplers and number-resolving detectors for Bell measurements, our experiment realizes a programmable four-way entanglement-routing primitive without active feed-forward, paving the way toward scalable quantum network fabrics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Entanglement-Swapping Network for Distributed Sum-Phase Quantum Sensing\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a cascaded entanglement-swapping protocol in PytHeus that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and two sequential Bell measurements to fuse three locally phase-imprinted photons into the target two-photon entangled state |\u03c8_out\u27e9 = |00\u27e9 + e^{i(\u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083)}|11\u27e9. A single two-port interference measurement on this state directly yields fringes at the total phase \u03c6\u2081+\u03c6\u2082+\u03c6\u2083, realizing Heisenberg-limit scaling for three-node sum-phase estimation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Driven Photonic Ring Measurement of the Entanglement-Spectrum Form Factor\n\nAbstract: We propose to target the entanglement-spectrum form factor K(k,2)=|Tr[\u03c1_A(k)^2]|^2 in a small, stroboscopically driven photonic ring by correlating two-copy swap-test \u201cHBT\u201d heralding coincidences. By preparing and Floquet-driving two identical ring copies in parallel, then routing subsystem A modes into independent swap-test interferometers, we directly map K(k,2) versus drive depth k and thereby reveal level-spacing correlations in the entanglement spectrum.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors.

Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nThe target \u201cChiral-Edge Multi-Hop Entanglement Swapping on a Chern Photonic Lattice\u201d implements a linear-optical network in which sequential Bell measurements and ancilla photon swaps are forced to propagate strictly along a topologically protected one-way edge of a 2D Chern lattice, thereby distributing high-fidelity entanglement between distant output modes without generating forbidden multi-photon states. By restricting all Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors to allowed edge bonds, the scheme exploits the nontrivial Chern band topology to maintain robustness against static bulk defects and connectivity disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Anti-PT Topological Bell-State Analyzer for Deterministic Four-State Discrimination\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a linear-optics network incorporating an anti-PT\u2013symmetric SSH loop of beam splitters driven by two ancillary photon-pair sources to realize a complete four-outcome Bell measurement.

By encoding each \u201catom\u201d qubit as a dual-rail single photon, inserting Pauli-X operations through local phase flips, and deploying two Bell-pair ancillas for parallel swap-test subcircuits, a Pythues-optimized 4\u00d74 interferometer implements U(t) and U\u2020(t) and heralds the OTOC value via zero-click correlations on number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Three-Node Entanglement Router Optimizing Genuine Tripartite Mutual Information\n\nMini-abstract: We implement a static photonic linear-optical network in Pytheus\u2014comprising three SPDC pair sources, a tunable three-mode interferometer, and heralding ancilla detectors\u2014to variationally extremize the genuine tripartite mutual information I\u2083(A;B;C) among remote modes A, B, and C.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Z\u2083 Topological Teleportation of a Qutrit via Triple-Path Superposition\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate an all-linear-optical protocol that teleports an arbitrary input qutrit |\u03c8\u27e9 from source node S to the target qutrit at node T by coherently superposing three disjoint Bell-swap entanglement paths through intermediate nodes A, B, and C.  Post-selected detection of one photon per ancilla and one click at T heralds a U_Z\u2083 phase imprint diag(1,e^{2\u03c0i/3},e^{4\u03c0i/3}) on the teleported qutrit basis {\u22230\u27e9,\u22231\u27e9,\u22232\u27e9}, directly encoding the network\u2019s Z\u2083 loop homology class as a genuine higher-order topological invariant of the teleportation channel.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Bell-State POVM with Two-Mode Squeezed-Vacuum Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We design a near-deterministic Bell-state analyzer by interfacing an unknown two-photon Bell state with two two-mode squeezed-vacuum ancilla pairs, a fully parameterized 6\u00d76 linear-optical interferometer, and threshold detectors, then use a classical variational optimizer to tune beam-splitter ratios and phase shifts. The target is the four-outcome POVM specified by the Bell basis {\u2502\u03a6\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a6\u207b\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207a\u27e9,\u2502\u03a8\u207b\u27e9}, and our algorithm maximizes the conditional probability of correctly identifying each Bell state beyond the 50% bound of passive optics.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum tomography of structured light patterns from simple intensity\n  measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Iso-entangled bases and joint measurements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Quantum Kinetic Rates within the Nonequilibrium Steady State\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\n3pES\n{'explanation': 'In this example we create entanglement between two parties of three qubits each.\\nThis means that we want to create six qubits: A, B, C on one side and D, E, F on the other side.\\n\\nThe goal is to have each corresponding pair (A&D, B&E, C&F) form a two-dimensional Bell state. In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

On one side, encode a polarization qubit; on the other, encode a qubit into two specific THz\u2010separated frequency modes. Perform a Bell\u2010state measurement that \u201cswaps\u201d the polarization qubit into the frequency\u2010bin DOF, effectively simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling (polariton) interface between polarization and frequency. Then teleport that qubit onward.\n    b) Hybrid Node Network Emulating THz Strong Coupling via Ancillary High\u2010Dimensional Mode:\n       \u2013 Build a three\u2010node network A\u2013C\u2013B. A\u2013C share a 2D Bell pair, C\u2013B share a D\u2010dimensional Bell pair (D\u226b2), where the extra dimensions emulate matter excitations at THz energy splittings. At C, perform a joint measurement across the 2D and D\u2010dimensional systems (a \u201chybrid\u201d Bell measurement) that enacts an entanglement swap and simulates the strong coupling between light (2D) and matter (D\u2010dimensional THz manifold). This teleports A\u2019s qubit into B\u2019s high\u2010D mode.\n    c) Teleportation of a Qubit through Simulated Polaritonic Modes Using Ancillary THz\u2010Bin Photons:\n       \u2013 Prepare two three\u2010party entangled GHZ\u2010like links: one in polarization and one in THz\u2010frequency bins. Use ancillary THz\u2010frequency photons to mediate a three\u2010photon joint measurement that swaps entanglement between the polarization GHZ and the THz\u2010GHZ, simulating the formation and decay of polaritons under strong coupling. Then use that to teleport a polarization qubit from node A to node B via the THz network.\n  Step 2: Novelty & Obstacles:\n    a) Novel\u2014no prior Pytheus experiment mixes 2D polarization with THz\u2010spaced frequency bins in a swapping protocol. Obstacle: Pytheus requires abstract bins; however frequency bins are just abstract high\u2010dimensional modes, so feasible.\n    b) Novel\u2014hybrid Bell measurement between different dimensions; no direct analog in list. Obstacle: specifying a joint measurement across different subsystems is expressible as target amplitudes.\n    c) More complex\u2014GHZ in two DOFs and GHZ\u2010swap; likely too intricate and may strain Pytheus\u2019s loss\u2010function calibration.\n  Step 3: Pick (a) Frequency\u2010Bin Teleportation;\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it explicitly combines a two\u2010dimensional polarization qubit with a THz\u2010spaced high\u2010dimensional frequency\u2010bin entangled channel in an entanglement\u2010swapping/teleportation protocol. No previous Pytheus target mixes low\u2010D and high\u2010D modes in this manner or references THz spacing.\n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:\n    \u2022 It defines an abstract two\u2010mode (polarization) system and an abstract N\u2010mode (frequency bins) system\u2014both allowed.\n    \u2022 The target is an entanglement swapping/teleportation of an abstract qubit, without focusing on physical state generation.\n    \u2022 No feedback control or cavities are needed\u2014only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, and joint measurements.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription: Teleportation of a polarization qubit into a THz\u2010spaced frequency\u2010bin qudit via entanglement swapping, simulating a strong light\u2013matter coupling interface.\nExplanation:\n  We consider two distinct DOFs:\n    \u2013 Qubit (polarization) at node A.\n    \u2013 Qubit encoded into two THz\u2010separated frequency bins at node B.\n  We start with:\n    1) A polarization Bell pair between A (photon 0) and C (photon 1): |00>_pol + |11>_pol.\n    2) A 2\u2010bin frequency\u2010bin Bell pair between C (photon 2) and B (photon 3): |\u03c91,\u03c91> + |\u03c92,\u03c92>, where \u0394\u03c9 \u2248 THz.\n  Goal: teleport an arbitrary polarization state |\u03c8> on photon 0 to the two\u2010bin frequency qubit on detector 3.\n  Protocol:\n    \u2013 Alice (node A) holds photon 0 in unknown polarization |\u03c8>.\n    \u2013 Charlie at node C holds photons 1 and 2 (one in polarization, one in frequency bins).\n    \u2013 Charlie performs a joint Bell\u2010state measurement between photons 0 and 1 across polarization modes. This measurement swaps entanglement onto photons 2 (freq) and 0\u20131 pair, effectively imprinting |\u03c8> onto the frequency\u2010bin DOF of photon 2.\n    \u2013 Photon 2 is then already the teleported state in frequency bins; to complete, one can swap frequency\u2010bin labels via a swap test into photon 3.\n  Abstract Target Quantum (over four modes 0\u20133):\n    List amplitudes for the four\u2010mode basis that encode this teleportation (cf. standard qubit teleportation but replacing the teleported output mode with frequency\u2010bin labels).\n  Config Sketch:\n    \u2022 num_pre: 1 (one prepare stage with two probabilistic pair sources)\n    \u2022 num_anc: 0 (no extra ancillas; all four photons used)\n    \u2022 removed_connections: none (pairs define which detectors they feed)\n    \u2022 single_emitters: []\n    \u2022 heradling_out: None\n    \u2022 loss_func: \u2018cr\u2019 (complex\u2010amplitude matching)\n    \u2022 target_quantum: amplitudes for teleportation map      \t\nVisual Layout:\n  Pair source S1 \u2192 photons 0 & 1 (pol qubit)\n  Pair source S2 \u2192 photons 2 & 3 (freq qubit bins)\n  Linear\u2010optics network mixes modes of photons 0&1 at Charlie\u2019s Bell\u2010measurement block, leaving photons 2&3 untouched until output.\n  Detectors: [0(pol)] [1(pol)] [2(freq)] [3(freq)].\n\nThis network acts as an abstract teleportation channel from polarization (photon 0) to THz\u2010frequency\u2010bin qubit (photon 3), capturing the essence of strong light\u2013matter coupling via an entanglement swap between different modal spaces.\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: The scheme reduces to ordinary qubit teleportation between two DOFs and closely parallels existing frequency-bin teleportation proposals; you need a genuinely new network primitive, nonstandard resource conversion, or higher-order effect to be considered novel.\n\nImportant reminder about task:\n\nREMEMBER: KEEP THE FEEDBACK RECORD FROM ABOVE INTO ACCOUNT!!!\nALSO: SUPER IMPORTANT: DO NOT SUGGEST STATE GENERATION!!!!!!!!!
