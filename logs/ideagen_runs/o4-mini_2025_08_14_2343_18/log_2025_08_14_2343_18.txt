    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: A Computational Separation Between Quantum No-cloning and\n  No-teleportation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: 40 km Fiber Transmission of Squeezed Light Measured with a Real Local\n  Oscillator\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Dynamic conditioning of two particle discrete-time quantum walks\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries U\u2093=exp(\u2212i\u03c0X\u2081X\u2082X\u2083X\u2084/4) and U_z=exp(\u2212i\u03c0Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement.

Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links.

By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries U\u2093=exp(\u2212i\u03c0X\u2081X\u2082X\u2083X\u2084/4) and U_z=exp(\u2212i\u03c0Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  Integrated-Photonic Entanglement\u2010Dimension Splitting Supermap via Optical Metasurface  \n\nAbstract:  We propose an on-chip supermap that passively converts a single d\u00b2-dimensional Bell link between nodes A and B into two independent d-dimensional Bell links A\u2013C and B\u2013D, targeting the coherent \u201cdimension splitting\u201d of entanglement without active feed-forward.  The scheme employs two probabilistic photon-pair sources, one ancilla photon, a static (d\u00b2+1)\u00d7(d\u00b2+1) metasurface multiport and number-resolving heralding detectors, and is fully optimizable within the PyTheus framework as a new resource-multiplexing primitive for quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nMulti-Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present an all\u2010linear\u2010optical protocol, \u201cMulti\u2010Path Entanglement Percolation via Parity Filtering in Irreversible Scattering,\u201d that fuses two Bell pairs A\u2013B\u2080 and C\u2080\u2013D into a high-fidelity link between remote photons A and D. By steering both B\u2080 and C\u2080 through unknown multimode scattering channels U\u2081,U\u2082 with programmable wavefront shapers and performing a single ancilla\u2010mediated parity filter across the combined outputs, an even-parity detection event heralds successful entanglement percolation without ever fully inverting the scattering matrices.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable Integrated Three-Photon GHZ-Basis Analyzer on Pytheus\n\nAbstract: We implement the target Pytheus-configurable three-photon GHZ-basis analyzer by injecting three unknown photonic qubits and an ancilla Bell pair into a fixed mesh of 50:50 beam splitters augmented with three on-chip electro-optic phase shifters and heralding detectors, thereby unambiguously mapping any incoming triple onto one of the four GHZ basis states. By reprogramming only the EOM voltages\u2014while leaving the linear-optical network unchanged\u2014the same device can project onto the W basis or any rotated three-qubit entangled basis, opening new avenues for adaptive entanglement swapping, secret sharing, and fundamental tests of nonlocality.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cHeralded Spectral-Control Quantum Router via Linear-Optical Controlled-SWAP\u201d\n\nAbstract: We realize the target two-node quantum router transformation \n|c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083 \u2192 |c\u27e9\u2080,\u2081\u2297(swap_if_c=1\u2009|d\u27e9\u2082,\u2083) \nby implementing a heralded 4\u00d74 controlled-SWAP in a compact linear-optical circuit, in which a single control qubit encoded in two spectral modes at Alice coherently routes an arbitrary spatially encoded data qubit to remote nodes Charlie (modes 4,5) or David (modes 6,7) with number-resolving ancilla detection.

Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Bell-Measurement Node for Loss-Robust Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose replacing the fixed Bell-state analyzer at a quantum repeater node with a small, tunable linear-optics ansatz circuit U(\u03b8) acting on incoming modes B\u2081, B\u2082 and ancilla photons to interpolate between ideal Bell measurements and alternative joint detections. Using PyTheus, the experiment targets finding the minimal-depth configuration of beam splitters and phase shifters that maximizes the post-heralded teleportation fidelity of the A\u2013C channel created by entanglement swapping under realistic loss constraints.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target \u201cheralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,\u201d realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD\u2009+\u2009PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Topologically Protected On-Demand Entanglement Switch in an SSH-Star Nanofiber Network\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a star-shaped quantum switch composed of N identical optical nanofiber SSH chains that meet at a single topological defect, whose zero-energy hub modes are mixed in a programmable multiport beam-splitter to route entanglement. By injecting probabilistic Bell-pair photons at each branch tip, engineering alternating strong/weak static beam-splitter couplings, and performing a heralded Bell measurement on any two chosen hub modes, the device projects the corresponding edge photons into the target two-qubit Bell state on-demand, all realized within PythEus\u2019s linear-optics optimization framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Square-Network Bell Test via Wavefront\u2010Shaped Nanophotonic Resonator Analyzers\n\nAbstract: We propose a fully static four\u2010node cycle experiment (A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D\u2013A) that employs four independent entangled photon\u2010pair sources and two 4\u00d74 multiport Bell\u2013state analyzers implemented by wavefront shaping of nanophotonic resonator arrays at nodes B and D, while nodes A and C perform local single\u2010photon measurements. By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Too close to existing entanglement\u2010swapping examples.\n    2. Pytheus cannot encode physical OAM coupling.\n    3. No prior 4D BSA in the explored list; this is purely a linear\u2010optical measurement network\u2014fully within Pytheus\u2019s scope.\n  Step 3: Select idea #3 as most promising.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because existing Pytheus targets include qubit and qutrit BSAs and high\u2010D entanglement swapping, but none tackle the full discrimination of four\u2010dimensional cyclic Bell states using a single static linear network. Embedding it conceptually as a metasurface\u2010inspired multiport coupler on an integrated chip adds a clear, new physical\u2010implementation angle and promises a novel interference effect: unique cyclic phase relationships only realizable in D\u22654 BSA.\n  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because:\n    \u2022 It\u2019s a projective measurement network (Bell\u2010state analyzer), not state generation.\n    \u2022 Only uses probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, ancilla photons, linear optics (multiport + beam splitters), and photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors.\n    \u2022 Requires no dynamic feed-forward; all modes are abstract.\n    \u2022 Can be described by a target_quantum of the 16 cyclic 4D Bell states and ancilla heralding, exactly what Pytheus excels at.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Integrated Metasurface-Inspired 4D Bell-State Analyzer\",\n  \"foldername\": \"4d_BSA_metasurface\",\n  \"bulk_thr\": 0.01,\n  \"edges_tried\": 40,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-06,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"num_anc\": 4,\n  \"num_pre\": 1,\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"imaginary\": false,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"samples\": 20,\n  \"target_quantum\": [\n    \"00\",\"11\",\"22\",\"33\",    // a=0\n    \"01\",\"12\",\"23\",\"30\",    // a=1\n    \"02\",\"13\",\"20\",\"31\",    // a=2\n    \"03\",\"10\",\"21\",\"32\"     // a=3\n  ],\n  \"in_nodes\": [],\n  \"out_nodes\": [],\n  \"thresholds\": [0.25, 0.05],\n  \"heralding_out\": [4,5,6,7],\n  \"single_emitters\": [],\n  \"amplitudes\": [],\n  \"tries_per_edge\": 5,\n  \"removed_connections\": [],\n  \"unicolor\": false,\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"anc_detectors\": []\n}\n\nExplanation:\nWe ask Pytheus to design a static linear-optical network\u2014interpreted physically as an on-chip metasurface multiport coupler followed by beam splitters\u2014that takes two ququarts (each encoded abstractly in 4 modes) plus four ancilla photons, and performs a projective measurement unambiguously discriminating all four cyclic 4D Bell states |\u03a8\u2090\u27e9=\u2211\u2096|k,k+a\u27e9, a\u2208{0\u20263}. Each Bell state corresponds to a unique coincidence pattern among the eight detectors; the four ancilla detectors herald success. By conceptualizing the central multiport as a reconfigurable \u201coptical metasurface\u201d integrated in the photonic structure, we highlight a route toward ultra-compact, programmable, high-dimensional Bell analyzers for quantum networks."

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries U\u2093=exp(\u2212i\u03c0X\u2081X\u2082X\u2083X\u2084/4) and U_z=exp(\u2212i\u03c0Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C.

Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic SWAP-Test Network for Direct Measurement of Quadratic Fermion Entanglement Spectrum\n\nAbstract: We propose a static linear-optical network whose target transformation is the global SWAP operator enacted across two N-mode photonic registers encoding identical copies of a quadratic fermionic ground state, realized via parallel Bell-pair ancillas and entanglement-swapping modules. By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries U\u2093=exp(\u2212i\u03c0X\u2081X\u2082X\u2083X\u2084/4) and U_z=exp(\u2212i\u03c0Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nThere is an ensemble of Researchers and their best ideas are collected in a shared list.

By heralding symmetric versus antisymmetric outcomes in the ancilla detectors and recording parity-resolved coincidences, the scheme directly yields the second R\u00e9nyi entropy of a chosen subsystem, providing a scalable, cavity-free protocol to probe the entanglement spectrum of free fermions using only SPDC sources and beam splitters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Nonlocal SWAP Gate Between Remote Photonic Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We target the realization of a fully heralded nonlocal SWAP gate between two unknown photonic qubits |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9_B at node B using only static linear optics, probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources, and post-selected detection. A central four-photon interferometric measurement on ancilla photons heralds the successful one-shot exchange of the unknown qubits between output modes A_out and B_out, without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe introduce a static, post-selected linear-optical gadget that implements the four-qubit parity-phase unitaries U\u2093=exp(\u2212i\u03c0X\u2081X\u2082X\u2083X\u2084/4) and U_z=exp(\u2212i\u03c0Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084/4) corresponding to the star and plaquette terms of the Kitaev Hamiltonian via Bell-pair ancillas, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors. Concatenating U\u2093 then U_z in a single heralded Trotter step realizes one digital interaction unitary e^{\u2212i\u03b8H_Kitaev} on four photonic qubits, enabling network-based simulation of topological codes without requiring state generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Floquet-Walk Entanglement-Swap Measurement of Topological Winding in a 1D Synthetic Photonic Band\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a Floquet-walk entanglement-swap measurement of a dynamical topological order parameter in a one-dimensional synthetic photonic band by injecting Bell-pair photons into a discrete-time quantum-walk lattice of beam splitters and phase shifters.  By performing Bell-state projections between time-evolved modes at layers k and N\u2013k and recording the swapped correlation rates as k is varied, one directly reconstructs the Floquet winding number using only linear-optical elements and post-selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nParity-Checked Multi\u2010Mode Entanglement Swapping Repeater for High\u2010Fidelity A\u2013D Link  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe implement a single-herald loss-tolerant repeater that performs two simultaneous Bell-swaps and a parity check via a joint six-mode linear-optical interferometer measurement with two vacuum ancillas, mixing photons from A\u2013B and C\u2013D Bell\u2010pair sources.  Conditioning on the unique sixfold coincidence herald pattern yields a high\u2010fidelity Bell state between end nodes A and D, demonstrating an efficient repeater for long-distance quantum communication.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Dissipative Cyclic Entanglement Shifter for Photonic Bell Pairs\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a static, single-step dissipative network primitive that cyclically reconfigures three pre-existing photonic Bell pairs (modes AB, CD, EF) into the target six-photon cyclic permutation subspace, yielding new entangled pairs AD, CF, and EB via a two-ancilla-photon heralding event. By mixing only the \u201cmiddle\u201d modes with two ancilla photons through beam splitters and phase shifters\u2014and detecting exactly one photon on each ancilla detector\u2014this passive linear-optical protocol achieves the desired entanglement shift without active feedback or cavities and plugs directly into the Pytheus toolkit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Noiseless Linear Amplification of a Fock\u2010Qubit via Photon-Blockade Ancillas\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose and analyze a PythEus-compatible, measurement-induced noiseless linear amplifier that implements the non-unitary map  \n\u2003\u2003M|0\u27e9=|0\u27e9,  \n\u2003\u2003M|1\u27e9=g\u2009|1\u27e9  (g>1)  \non an unknown photonic qubit encoded in the Fock basis {\u2009|0\u27e9,|1\u27e9\u2009}. The scheme employs one SPDC-generated nonclassical signal\u2013idler pair together with two pure single-photon \u201cphoton-blockade\u201d ancillas and a specific two-click PNR-detector heralding pattern, using only beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number\u2013resolving detectors, and no cavities or dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ring\u2010Swapped Tri\u2010Mode Optical Interferometer for Simultaneous Estimation of Three Relative Phases\n\nAbstract: We implement a closed\u2010loop network of three SPDC two\u2010mode squeezed\u2010vacuum sources linked by sequential Bell swaps at a central node X, apply unknown phase shifts \u03c6A, \u03c6B, and \u03c6C at parties A, B, and C, and route the resulting modes through a PythEUS\u2010optimized 3\u00d73 linear\u2010optical multiport with photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors. The joint detection probability P(nA,nB,nC | \u03c6A,\u03c6B,\u03c6C) exhibits interference fringes \u221d cos(\u03c6i \u2212 \u03c6j) for each mode pair (i,j), thus realizing the pure\u2010measurement transformation that directly encodes and enables simultaneous estimation of the phase differences \u03c6A\u2212\u03c6B, \u03c6B\u2212\u03c6C, and \u03c6C\u2212\u03c6A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Number\u2013Resolving W-State Analyzer for Free-Space Conference QKD\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a static linear-optics module that uses two probabilistic Bell-pair ancilla sources and six photon-number-resolving detectors to unambiguously project three incoming qubit-encoded photons onto a chosen target W-basis state via distinct post-selected detection patterns.

Upon a specific four-click detection pattern, the unmeasured remote modes collapse into the target qubit Bell state, achieving the conversion from two qutrit Bell pairs to one qubit Bell pair.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback.

    "output": "Thought: The proposal targets a genuinely new measurement primitive\u2014minimizing ancilla photons to just two while still unambiguously discriminating all sixteen cyclic 4-dimensional Bell states\u2014rather than simply rebranded dimension lifts of known qubit/ququart analyzers. No prior ensemble entry attempts a resource-optimized high-D Bell analyzer with fewer ancillas, so this addresses a nontrivial question about the linear-optics ancilla\u2013success\u2013probability trade-off. Action: accept Action Input: By asking for only two ancilla photons (instead of the usual four) and claiming higher average success probability, this design tackles an open problem in high\u2010dimensional Bell\u2010state discrimination. It pushes beyond existing 4-ancilla schemes, defines a clear optimization goal in resource economy, and\u2014if realized\u2014would represent a novel PRL-worthy advance in metasurface-based integrated photonic measurement."
