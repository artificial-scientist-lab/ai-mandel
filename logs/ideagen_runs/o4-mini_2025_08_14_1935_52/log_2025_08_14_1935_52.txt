    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s a standard 2\u2010qubit swapping target, Pytheus can optimize any 4\u00d74 linear network. \n    B) Requires dynamic re\u2010routing (multiple separate static set\u2010ups) or feedback control \u2013 Pytheus can only design static networks, so implementing true on\u2010demand switching is tricky without external feedforward.\n    C) High\u2010dimensional swap through many ancilla modes risks state\u2010generation flavor and complexity; Pytheus can handle higher dimensions, but it\u2019s less clearly formulated as a simple swap target.\n  Step 3: Pick A as most promising: novel, feasible, stays within swapping (no forbidden state generation), and only uses static linear optics.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because using a disordered nano\u2010resonator array\u2014taught by wavefront shaping\u2014as a programmable Bell\u2013state analyzer for entanglement swapping has not been proposed in existing Pytheus examples or the literature.  \n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all given constraints because it reduces to designing a static 4\u00d74 linear optical unitary (the scattering medium) and two Bell\u2010pair sources plus ancilla detectors. Pytheus can optimize the equivalent network of beamsplitters and phase shifters; there is no dynamic feedback or state\u2010generation target, only a standard entanglement\u2010swapping network with a novel \u201cdevice\u201d in the middle.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input: \nDescription:\nIn this experiment we demonstrate entanglement swapping of two photons that never meet by performing the intermediate Bell\u2013state projection inside a disordered nano\u2010resonator array whose random 4\u00d74 unitary U is \u201cprogrammed\u201d via wavefront shaping.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0.

Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Path Teleportation Emulation of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer\n\nAbstract: We implement a Pyth e us-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a qubit from node A to node C via two competing Bell-swapping paths with tunable source amplitudes encoding the J\u2081 and J\u2082 couplings of a two-spin Heisenberg dimer. By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection. The successful eight-fold coincidence projects detectors 0\u20133 and 12\u201315 onto the unnormalized target quantum state  \n[\"00000000\", \"00001111\", \"11110000\", \"11111111\", \"00110011\", \"00111100\", \"11000011\", \"11001100\"],  \nheralding a fault-tolerant logical Bell pair between A and D without any feed-forward correction.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

It should be taken very seriously. Take it into account when coming up with your own idea. TAKE IT SERIOUS, THE FEEDBACK IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!!! BEFORE CREATING AN IDEA, THINK ABOUT WHETHER MY PREVIOUS FEEDBACK WOULD ALLOW IT!!!\n\nBe constructively critical of your own idea and check if it is novel. Refine it and aim for producing a truly novel idea.\n\nHere are the targets that pytheus has already designed quantum optics experiments for.  A new idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No dynamic feedback is needed; we only postselect on a 3\u2010click pattern. This is novel relative to all previous Pytheus swaps.\n    3) Reconfigurable routing requires dynamic control or switching, not allowed.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 2.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it generalizes entanglement swapping to three independent Bell pairs, performing a single joint GHZ\u2010basis projection on the three ancilla photons inside a static, wavefront\u2010shaped nano\u2010resonator interferometer. No prior Pytheus experiment realizes multipartite entanglement swapping into a GHZ network.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a 6\u00d76 (or 3\u00d73 with vacuum ancilla) linear\u2010optical unitary, mixing three ancilla photons (the second halves of three Bell pairs) plus any required vacuum modes, and postselecting on the three\u2010fold click that heralds the GHZ projection. There is no dynamic feedback, hyper\u2010entanglement, or forbidden healing\u2014the network is static, uses only probabilistic pair sources, vacuum inputs, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

Heralded two-photon click patterns in even or odd detector pairs directly project the data qubits onto the \u00b11 eigenstates of Z\u2081Z\u2082Z\u2083Z\u2084, realizing a direct stabilizer measurement without any feed-forward or dynamic control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel Interferometry\n\nMini-abstract: We present a fully passive silicon-photonic circuit\u2014an On-Chip Three-Photon GHZ Basis Analyzer via Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel interferometry\u2014that projects three unknown single-photon qubits onto the tripartite GHZ basis (|000\u27e9\u00b1|111\u27e9)/\u221a2 using only integrated waveguides, 50\u223650 beam splitters, three SPDC-sourced Bell-pair ancillas and number-resolving detectors without any active feed-forward. This novel static linear-optics supermap paves the way for scalable on-chip multiparty entanglement analysis, enabling quantum-network tasks such as conference key distribution and secret sharing directly in silicon.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: A Pythreus-Compatible Multiplexed Quantum Entanglement Router via Hybrid Plasmonic\u2013Nanophotonic Waveguides\n\nAbstract: We develop a pythreus quantum network target\u2014the Quantum Entanglement Router\u2014that multiplexes heralded Bell-state projections among two remote nanophotonic chips (Alice, Bob) and a central hybrid plasmonic\u2013nanophotonic routing node (Charlie) to distribute entanglement on demand. Leveraging probabilistic photon-pair sources, a four-mode linear-optical mesh, and ancilla-assisted detectors, our scheme post-selectively routes entangled pairs between Alice\u2013Bob, Alice\u2013Charlie, or Bob\u2013Charlie using flexible heralding patterns.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t.

Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states.

By measuring the teleportation fidelity of the explicit Bell-state target |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 between A and C as a function of the amplitude ratio J\u2082/J\u2081, we directly reproduce the ground-state crossover and frustration physics of the J\u2081\u2013J\u2082 model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement Swapping of 2\u00d72 Toric-Code Logical Qubits via Linear Optics\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate entanglement swapping between two distant logical qubits, each encoded in a minimal 2\u00d72 toric-code patch of four photons at nodes A and D, by performing a post-selected logical Bell measurement on intermediate patches B and C using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, passive linear optics, and ancilla detection.

Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

Four remote users A,B,C,D each hold one photon of a Bell pair; their partners (ancilla photons) are sent into a single nanophotonic scattering medium whose 6\u00d76 unitary is set by wavefront shaping. By postselecting on *different* two-click patterns at the outputs, the same device swaps entanglement into *any* one of the \\(\\binom{4}{2}=6\\) user-pairs, without moving parts or active switching.\n\nVisualization (photons travel top\u2192bottom):\n\nSources:\n  S_A emits Bell pair \u2192 modes (A_out=0, a\u2081=4)  \n  S_B emits Bell pair \u2192 modes (B_out=1, a\u2082=5)  \n  S_C emits Bell pair \u2192 modes (C_out=2, a\u2083=6)  \n  S_D emits Bell pair \u2192 modes (D_out=3, a\u2084=7)\n\nNetwork:\n  Inputs [4,5,6,7] (the four ancilla photons) + [8,9] (vacuum ancilla)\n  \u2193 enter the 6\u00d76 scattering medium (wavefront-shaped nano\u2010resonator array)\n\nDetectors:\n  D\u2080\u2192mode 0 (A\u2019s output)  \n  D\u2081\u2192mode 1 (B\u2019s output)  \n  D\u2082\u2192mode 2 (C\u2019s output)  \n  D\u2083\u2192mode 3 (D\u2019s output)  \n  D\u2084\u2013D\u2089 measure the six outputs of the medium\n\nHeralding & Routing:\n  \u2022 If clicks at {D\u2084,D\u2085}\u200a\u2192\u200aswap entanglement between A&B (modes 0,1)  \n  \u2022 If clicks at {D\u2084,D\u2086}\u200a\u2192\u200aswap A&C  \n  \u2022 \u2026  \n  \u2022 If clicks at {D\u2088,D\u2089}\u200a\u2192\u200aswap C&D  \n  Each two-click pattern corresponds to a distinct Bell-measurement on that pair of ancilla inputs.

    "output": "Thought: While using a disordered scattering medium as a single static multiport to route entanglement among different user pairs is a clever hardware trick, it does not introduce a new quantum\u2010information primitive or fundamental effect. Any fixed interferometer of the same size could be programmed (via wavefront shaping or synthesis) to implement those same Bell projections; you are merely repackaging multiple standard Bell swaps in one big unitary.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

It\u2019s a standard 2\u2010qubit swapping target, Pytheus can optimize any 4\u00d74 linear network. \n    B) Requires dynamic re\u2010routing (multiple separate static set\u2010ups) or feedback control \u2013 Pytheus can only design static networks, so implementing true on\u2010demand switching is tricky without external feedforward.\n    C) High\u2010dimensional swap through many ancilla modes risks state\u2010generation flavor and complexity; Pytheus can handle higher dimensions, but it\u2019s less clearly formulated as a simple swap target.\n  Step 3: Pick A as most promising: novel, feasible, stays within swapping (no forbidden state generation), and only uses static linear optics.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because using a disordered nano\u2010resonator array\u2014taught by wavefront shaping\u2014as a programmable Bell\u2013state analyzer for entanglement swapping has not been proposed in existing Pytheus examples or the literature.  \n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all given constraints because it reduces to designing a static 4\u00d74 linear optical unitary (the scattering medium) and two Bell\u2010pair sources plus ancilla detectors.

No prior Pytheus experiment realizes multipartite entanglement swapping into a GHZ network.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a 6\u00d76 (or 3\u00d73 with vacuum ancilla) linear\u2010optical unitary, mixing three ancilla photons (the second halves of three Bell pairs) plus any required vacuum modes, and postselecting on the three\u2010fold click that heralds the GHZ projection. There is no dynamic feedback, hyper\u2010entanglement, or forbidden healing\u2014the network is static, uses only probabilistic pair sources, vacuum inputs, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

No prior Pytheus experiment realizes multipartite entanglement swapping into a GHZ network.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a 6\u00d76 (or 3\u00d73 with vacuum ancilla) linear\u2010optical unitary, mixing three ancilla photons (the second halves of three Bell pairs) plus any required vacuum modes, and postselecting on the three\u2010fold click that heralds the GHZ projection.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.

The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles. However, by integrating all three pairs into a single combined setup and using a clever measurement scheme inspired by entanglement swapping, fewer ancillary particles are needed overall.', 'config': {'description': 'Entanglement swapping between two parties of three qubits each.', 'foldername': '3pES', 'bulk_thr': 0.01, 'edges_tried': 30, 'ftol': 1e-06, 'loss_func': 'cr', 'num_anc': 4, 'num_pre': 1, 'optimizer': 'L-BFGS-B', 'imaginary': False, 'safe_hist': True, 'samples': 10, 'target_quantum': ['000000', '001001', '010010', '011011', '100100', '101101', '110110', '111111'], 'in_nodes': [], 'out_nodes': [], 'thresholds': [0.3, 0.1], 'heralding_out': None, 'single_emitters': [], 'amplitudes': [], 'tries_per_edge': 5, 'removed_connections': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [0, 5], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5]], 'seed': None, 'unicolor': False, 'number_resolving': True, 'novac': None, 'loops': None, 'topopt': None, 'dimensions': [], 'brutal_covers': None, 'verts': [], 'anc_detectors': []}}\n\n\n\n\nHere is one last, but absolutely necessary condition:\nYour proposed research idea should combine these two scientific concepts in a meaningful way.\n\"wavefront shaping\" and \"nano resonator\"\n\nTry your best to combine these concepts even if it means suggesting experiments that are very different from the examples you have seen.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource.

Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Hybrid-Dimensional Qubit\u2013Qutrit Entanglement Swapping via a Full 2\u00d73 Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in PyTheus a probabilistic protocol that entangles a Rydberg-encoded qubit (mode 0) with a condensate-encoded qutrit (mode 3) by performing a full 2\u00d73 Bell measurement on a shared qubit\u2013qutrit mediator (modes 1&2).  Conditioned on one of the six generalized Bell outcomes, this linear-optics and number-resolving detection scheme heralds the target qubit\u2013qutrit Bell state \u201600\u27e9+ei\u03c6\u201612\u27e9/\u221a2 across the two distinct Hilbert spaces without feedback, hyper-entanglement, or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nZak Phase Tomography via Closed-Loop Teleportation on a Photonic SSH Ring  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose a purely measurement-based photonic quantum network protocol that targets the Zak phase of the one-dimensional Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger (SSH) model by teleporting a qubit sequentially around a four-site periodic ring using four probabilistic Bell swaps. Conditioned on four ancilla heralding clicks, the qubit returns to its original spatial mode with a relative phase shift exactly equal to the target Zak phase of the SSH band, which is then read out by a simple two-mode interferometer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Certification of Genuine Tripartite Entanglement in a Minimal Triangle Network\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We implement a fully static linear\u2010optical triangle network of three probabilistic photon\u2010pair sources, where each node executes a small ancilla\u2010assisted bipartite entanglement witness circuit. Upon simultaneously observing the target 6-bit click pattern \u201c110110,\u201d corresponding to two-click heralds at each node, we certify genuine tripartite entanglement in the network without any global GHZ state preparation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Mode\u2010Division\u2010Multiplexed On\u2010Chip Purification of 3-Dimensional Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We propose an integrated\u2010optics node that purifies two probabilistic qutrit photon\u2010pair sources into the target high\u2010fidelity 3-dimensional Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9+|22\u27e9 by routing Alice\u2019s spatial modes and Bob\u2019s mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed channels through a 6\u00d76 linear\u2010optic parity\u2010check circuit with two ancilla heralding detectors. This design constitutes the first demonstration of on\u2010chip, mode\u2010division\u2010multiplexed entanglement purification in three dimensions, establishing a vital primitive for scalable, multi\u2010stage high\u2010dimensional quantum networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal. The resulting single\u2010click detector events yield a fully quantized classifier response targeting photonic qudit state discrimination as a new quantum\u2010metric machine\u2010learning primitive.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order. Using three probabilistic EPR sources, linear-optics routing into two Bell-measurement stations, and post-selection on the control measurement, this experiment realizes the target entanglement-switch quantum switch primitive without state-generation or dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Programmable Teleportation of CNOT and SWAP Gates onto Two Neutral-Atom Qubits\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fixed interferometer module that, depending on the internal state of a control atom (C) and heralding detector clicks, teleports either a CNOT\u208dA\u2192B\u208e or SWAP\u208dA\u2194B\u208e gate onto two remote target neutral-atom qubits A and B. Relying solely on single-emitter photons, probabilistic ancilla, linear optics and number-resolving heralds\u2014without cavities or active feed-forward\u2014this scheme realizes pure quantum-network transformations and is directly extensible to larger gate sets and control registers.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Cluster-Style Fusion for High-Fidelity Alice\u2013Bob Bell Pair Generation\n\nAbstract: We realize a one-shot entanglement purification and swapping node by performing a two-mode cluster-style fusion measurement at an intermediate station (Charlie), which simultaneously projects out parity errors and teleports entanglement.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

It\u2019s a standard 2\u2010qubit swapping target, Pytheus can optimize any 4\u00d74 linear network. \n    B) Requires dynamic re\u2010routing (multiple separate static set\u2010ups) or feedback control \u2013 Pytheus can only design static networks, so implementing true on\u2010demand switching is tricky without external feedforward.\n    C) High\u2010dimensional swap through many ancilla modes risks state\u2010generation flavor and complexity; Pytheus can handle higher dimensions, but it\u2019s less clearly formulated as a simple swap target.\n  Step 3: Pick A as most promising: novel, feasible, stays within swapping (no forbidden state generation), and only uses static linear optics.  \n  Step 4: This idea is novel because using a disordered nano\u2010resonator array\u2014taught by wavefront shaping\u2014as a programmable Bell\u2013state analyzer for entanglement swapping has not been proposed in existing Pytheus examples or the literature.  \n  Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all given constraints because it reduces to designing a static 4\u00d74 linear optical unitary (the scattering medium) and two Bell\u2010pair sources plus ancilla detectors.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced.

No prior Pytheus experiment realizes multipartite entanglement swapping into a GHZ network.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a 6\u00d76 (or 3\u00d73 with vacuum ancilla) linear\u2010optical unitary, mixing three ancilla photons (the second halves of three Bell pairs) plus any required vacuum modes, and postselecting on the three\u2010fold click that heralds the GHZ projection.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition.

For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This is novel relative to all previous Pytheus swaps.\n    3) Reconfigurable routing requires dynamic control or switching, not allowed.\n  Step 3: Pick idea 2.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because it generalizes entanglement swapping to three independent Bell pairs, performing a single joint GHZ\u2010basis projection on the three ancilla photons inside a static, wavefront\u2010shaped nano\u2010resonator interferometer. No prior Pytheus experiment realizes multipartite entanglement swapping into a GHZ network.  \n  Step 5: This is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to designing a 6\u00d76 (or 3\u00d73 with vacuum ancilla) linear\u2010optical unitary, mixing three ancilla photons (the second halves of three Bell pairs) plus any required vacuum modes, and postselecting on the three\u2010fold click that heralds the GHZ projection. There is no dynamic feedback, hyper\u2010entanglement, or forbidden healing\u2014the network is static, uses only probabilistic pair sources, vacuum inputs, and number\u2010resolving detectors.

By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Chirality-assisted enhancement of tripartite entanglement in waveguide\n  QED\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Long-distance distribution of qubit-qubit entanglement using\n  Gaussian-correlated photonic beams\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits. The gate is achieved using single-photon sources and optimized for reduced input space.\n\n8. **Post-Selected Toffoli Gate (3,3)**:\n   - A post-selected Toffoli gate with three control and three target qubits. Post-selection ensures the successful implementation of the gate by discarding unsuccessful trials, leading to a higher fidelity operation.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\nHere are some configurations of previously found experiments to inspire you\n\n### EXAMPLE 1 ###\nES_246\n{'explanation': \"In this example we create entanglement between two photons with four modes.\\nWe want the created photons to be entangled in a four dimensional Bell state\\n\\nPsi = |00>+|11>+|22>+|33> (without normalization)\\n\\nThe setup we are optimizing for here is constructed from probabilistic photon pair sources.\\n\\nThe setup to create this state would usually have a relatively simple layout (with four probabilistic pair sources creating the correlated photons), but we want to create this state in a way that is inspired by entanglement swapping.\\n\\nWe can visualize the setup in the following way (with the photons going from top to bottom):\\nsetup of photon pair sources: [elements to be optimized]\\ndetectors: [0][1][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.][anc. det.]\\nthere are four ancillary detectors as specified by 'num_anc'.\\n\\nIn the context of probabilistic photon-pair sources, the keyword 'removed_connections' excludes sources emitting to the specified pairs of detectors.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3).

By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Temporal-Mode Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping with Single Ancilla\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical station that uses one ancilla Bell pair and a single delay loop to perform two sequential entanglement swaps on unknown qubit pairs arriving in time bins t\u2081 and t\u2082, halving the ancillary resource requirement. The experiment explicitly targets eight two-click detection patterns (four at t\u2081, four at t\u2082) on number-resolving, time-tagging detectors, each pattern heralding a successful swap and showcasing a resonator-inspired temporal coupling strategy for resource-efficient quantum network primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module. Heralding coincidences in M_Z versus M_X project the target remote nodes A and C onto \u03a6\u207a_Z or \u03a6\u207a_X respectively, and by scanning \u03c6 and performing two-qubit tomography we observe high-visibility fringes certifying a coherent superposition of distinct Bell-state swap bases beyond ordinary swapping or switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Discrete Quantum\u2010Metric Classification of Photonic Qudits via Parallel SWAP\u2010Test Network\n\nAbstract: We implement a fixed linear\u2010optical network that routes a single unknown D\u2010level photonic qudit into one of K output ports by performing K parallel SWAP\u2010test and entanglement\u2010swapping modules against K reference states, thereby selecting the port whose Fubini\u2013Study distance to the input is minimal.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions. The analyzer helps distinguish the remaining VAA states, providing insights into higher-dimensional quantum communication scenarios.\n   \n7. **Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)**:\n   - This experiment showcases a heralded CNOT gate with three control qubits and three target qubits.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Superposed Perfect-Matching Entanglement Swaps in a Four-Node Photonic Circuit\n\nMini\u2013Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate an integrated-optics protocol that heralds and projects a coherent superposition of the three perfect-matching entanglement-swap configurations (AB&CD, AC&BD, AD&BC) among four ring-resonator photon-pair sources. By routing ancilla photons through a static 4\u00d74 multipath interferometer to erase which-swap information and postselecting on four-click coincidences, we realize in one shot the coherent entanglement routing across all pairing geometries.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cLinear-Optical Measurement-Based F-Move for Four Majorana Parity Qubits\u201d\n\nAbstract: We propose and analyze a purely linear-optical, post-selected network that implements the nontrivial F-move unitary on the total-charge-0 subspace of four Majorana parity qubits by fusing and re-coupling two ancillary Bell-pair sources via three sequential Bell measurements. The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: One-Shot Linear-Optical S\u2083 Schur Analyzer for Measuring the Entanglement Spectrum of an Unknown Photonic Subsystem\n\nAbstract: We introduce a passive linear-optical network that mixes three independent SPDC-generated copies of an unknown subsystem A (modes 0,2,4) with vacuum ancilla and projects onto the symmetric, mixed, and antisymmetric S\u2083 irreducible subspaces via three ancillary detectors. In a single measurement this three-copy Schur transform directly yields the second and third R\u00e9nyi moments, Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b2] and Tr[\u03c1_A\u00b3], thereby fully characterizing the entanglement spectrum of the target subsystem A.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Reconfigurable 3-Qubit GHZ-Basis Analyzer on a Hybrid-Waveguide Optical Phased Array\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip 5\u00d75 hybrid-waveguide interferometer that, by feeding in three unknown photonic qubits and two ancilla photons and programming five integrated phase shifters, realizes on-demand projections onto any of the eight three-qubit GHZ basis states. Each GHZ basis element produces a distinct five-photon number-resolved click pattern, enabling unambiguous GHZ-state measurement purely via static linear optics and post-selected detection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nEntanglement-Fano Interferometry via Three-Channel Heralded Swaps in a Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose a discrete-vs-continuum Fano-resonance experiment between distant nodes A and C in which the two-photon Bell-state amplitude from a direct Bell-pair source coherently interferes with amplitudes generated by successive two-hop (via B) and three-hop (via D\u2192E) heralded entanglement swaps, with static polarization phase shifts \u03c6\u2082 and \u03c6\u2083 controlling the interference.  The resulting asymmetric coincidence fringe at A\u2013C reproduces the characteristic Fano line shape of a micro-ring resonator in a purely linear, static network\u2014implementable in Pythueus using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, abstract phase shifters, Bell measurements, and photon-number-resolving detectors.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Continuous Topological Phase Transition of a Kitaev 1D Majorana Chain via Bell-Measurement Tuning in a Linear-Optical Entanglement-Swapping Network\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and simulate in Pytheus a linear-optical quantum network of probabilistic photon-pair sources and intermediate Bell-state measurements whose beam-splitter reflectivity r acts as a continuous control parameter, reproducing the continuous topological phase transition of the target Kitaev 1D Majorana chain. As r crosses a critical threshold r_c, long-range end-to-end entanglement between edge nodes A and Z suddenly emerges, faithfully mapping onto the onset of Majorana zero-mode correlations in the original topological model.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Direct Memory Witnessing of Non\u2010Markovian Entanglement Swapping in Linear\u2010Optic Networks\n\nAbstract: We realize two successive amplitude\u2010damping beam\u2010splitter couplings between system mode S\u2082 and entangled ancilla modes E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66, followed by a heralded Bell\u2010state measurement on S\u2082, S\u2083 to swap entanglement onto S\u2081, S\u2084. By running parallel four\u2010mode Bell analyzers on (S\u2081,S\u2084) and (S\u2081,E\u2082\u1d66), we directly observe nonmonotonic entanglement revival and correlation back\u2010flow in the post\u2010selected pure four\u2010mode state on S\u2081, S\u2084, E\u2082\u2090, E\u2082\u1d66 for each (p\u2081,p\u2082), thus operationally certifying non\u2010Markovian memory.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Driven Long-Range Quantum Walk on Four Photonic Modes\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a teleportation-based single-step analog quantum walk on a four-node chain A\u2013B\u2013C\u2013D by teleporting a single photon prepared at node A (mode 0) into a programmable superposition across nodes B, C, and D (modes 1, 2, 3) using only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics and an interfering Bell measurement. This directly realizes the Pytheus target network transformation\u2014mapping one photon in mode 0 onto modes 1, 2, 3 with tunable amplitudes\u2014in one discrete time-step of a long-range hopping Hamiltonian.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Interferometric Corner-Pump: Two-Arm Teleportation MZI for Quantized \u03c0-Phase and Corner-State Localization\n\nAbstract: We implement the target unitary mapping of a dual-rail qubit  \n|10\u27e9\u2192(|10\u27e9+e^{i\u03d5}|01\u27e9)/\u221a2, |01\u27e9\u2192(|01\u27e9\u2212e^{i\u03d5}|10\u27e9)/\u221a2 via two parallel boundary arms of sequential Bell-swap teleportation and a final balanced beam-splitter, yielding a quantized \u03c0-phase jump in the interference fringes at \u03d5=\u03c0. By removing one teleportation link (forbidden by disconnected connections), the interferometer collapses to a single-path and the photon localizes at the far corner C, directly manifesting the synthetic-flux\u2013corner-state correspondence in a purely linear-optics experiment.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Noisy Entanglement Swapping with Coherent Quantum Noise Cancellation  \n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an entanglement-swapping experiment in which two independent noisy links are modelled by ancilla photon-pair sources and, at the central station, a standard Bell-state projection on the signal modes is combined with Mach\u2013Zehnder interference on the noise modes to enact coherent cancellation of correlated mechanical-like noise. Conditioned on fourfold heralding of the ancilla detections, the remote signal modes at Alice and Bob collapse into the target two-photon Bell state |00\u3009+|11\u3009 despite originating from noisy channels, demonstrating a teleportation-style network implementation of coherent quantum noise cancellation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \n\u201cCyclic-Graph Teleportation with Passive Pauli Cancellation and Measurement-Controlled Phase Gate\u201d\n\nAbstract  \nWe implement a static linear-optical protocol that teleports an unknown qubit from Alice (mode 0) to Bob (mode 3) by entangling four probabilistic Bell pairs into a cycle graph, passively canceling all Pauli by-products and embedding a measurement-controlled Z-rotation on the teleported state without any active feed-forward. Rotated-basis joint measurements at repeater nodes X and Y (modes 1 & 2) jointly set the phase \u03c6, yielding deterministic teleportation and a \u03c6-dependent two-photon click pattern at herald detectors [0, 3] that confirms the controlled-phase signature.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Non-Abelian Wilson Loop via a Four-Step Teleportation Ring\n\nAbstract: We implement the proposed Pytheus target\u2014a closed \u201cteleporter loop\u201d around a four-site square\u2014by chaining four probabilistic photon-pair sources and sequential two-photon Bell measurements to teleport an input qubit around a plaquette and accumulate a non-trivial Pauli by-product holonomy. By post-selecting on a fixed pattern of Bell outcomes and contrasting clockwise versus counterclockwise traversal, we directly reveal a non-commuting (non-Abelian) Wilson-loop effect in a purely linear-optical quantum network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Single-Shot GHZ-Based Entanglement Percolation on an Integrated Photonic Chip\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a single-shot multi-photon GHZ-projection percolation protocol on an integrated photonic chip with ultra-high-Q microring delays, explicitly targeting a joint six-mode GHZ\u2297Bell measurement across three adjacent Bell-pair sources to herald end-to-end entanglement between two distant nodes. By replacing sequential two-photon swaps with one coherent four-port interferometer projection, our scheme uses only probabilistic sources, passive timing synchronization, and photon-counting detectors to introduce a new primitive for scalable entanglement-percolation in arbitrary graph networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nSymmetry-Protected Bound-State Router for Heralded Bell-State Generation in a Three-Node Quantum Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe employ a C\u2083-symmetric tritter to engineer a symmetry-protected bound state in the continuum (BIC) that traps an intermediate photon until a three\u2010fold no-click heralding event triggers entanglement swapping between remote nodes. Conditioned on this herald, the protocol projects the target two-photon Bell state onto modes A and D using only static linear optics and photon-number\u2013resolving detection, demonstrating a programmable route for scalable entanglement distribution.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Four-Party GHZ Entanglement-Swapping Star with 3\u21921 Network Steering\n\nAbstract: We implement a single-step four-photon GHZ entanglement-swapping star that fuses four independent probabilistic Bell-pair sources at a central station via a linear-optical 4-photon GHZ projector to realize the target 4-party GHZ resource. Conditioned on the heralding event, three remote parties perform mutually unbiased-basis measurements whose correlated outcomes, together with tomography data at the fourth party, violate a 3\u21921 multipartite EPR-steering inequality\u2014demonstrating genuine network steering without nonlinear elements or feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Post-Selected Linear-Optics Teleportation of Wigner-Negative Qutrits in d = 3\n\nAbstract: We design a discrete-variable teleportation channel in dimension d = 3 using a pre-shared probabilistic qutrit Bell pair, four single-photon ancillas, and number-resolving detectors within a linear-optics interferometer to probabilistically teleport any unknown qutrit input.  Leveraging the PytHeus framework, we optimize beam-splitter angles and routing to maximize the teleportation fidelity of representative Wigner-negative test states (\u03a8\u2081,\u03a8\u2082), explicitly targeting the preservation of Wigner function negativity as the primary performance metric.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Entanglement-Dimension Adapter for d\u21922 Bell State Conversion\n\nMini-abstract: We design a linear-optical network that probabilistically compresses a d-dimensional Bell pair emitted by a Kerr resonator and a two-level Bell pair from a transmon into the canonical two-qubit Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 across modes A\u2081 (node 0) and B\u2082 (node 3). By mixing modes A\u2082 and B\u2081 with ancilla photons in an optimized interferometer and employing photon-number-resolving detection, the scheme heralds successful swapping and compression of multi-level entanglement into a qubit link between the Kerr and transmon nodes without feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Measurement-Only Linear-Optical Network for Modular S-Matrix Negativity in Non-Abelian Anyon Models\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose an explicit linear-optical, measurement-only scheme that simulates the modular S-matrix element S\u208di,j\u208e of a chosen non-Abelian anyon theory via entanglement swapping and heralded Bell\u2013fusion measurements. By performing a two-copy SWAP-test on the network\u2019s outputs, four-fold coincidence rates directly yield the second-R\u00e9nyi entanglement negativity \u221d|S\u208di,j\u208e|\u00b2, providing an operational readout of topological data using only probabilistic Bell-pair sources, static interferometers, phase-shifters, and number-resolving detectors in Pytheus.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear\u2010Optical Partial-SWAP Gate for Emulating Coherent Rabi Oscillations and Ultrastrong Coupling in Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose a heralded linear-optical implementation of the tunable partial-SWAP unitary  \nU(\u03b8)=cos \u03b8 I + i\u2009sin \u03b8 SWAP on two photonic-qubit modes, which continuously maps the \u03b8-dependent population exchange |10\u27e9\u2194|01\u27e9 (analogous to coherent Rabi oscillations) into the ultrastrong-coupling regime at \u03b8\u2192\u03c0/2 (full SWAP with multi-photon excitations). Using ancilla photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and static interferometry for post-selection, this building block realizes a modular \u201cquantum bus\u201d for coherent excitation transfer, ultrafast entanglement swapping, and teleportation across N-node networks.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Phase-Detuned Asymmetric 1\u21922 Single-Photon Quantum Cloning\n\nMini-abstract:  \nWe propose and simulate in Pythreous a novel 1\u21922 heralded, phase-detuned asymmetric quantum cloning circuit for an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9, using only an SPDC ancilla pair, a single-photon emitter, two static beam splitters, a tunable phase shifter, and photon-number-resolving detectors. Conditioned on coincident clicks at the two heralding detectors, this Phase-Detuned Heralded Asymmetric Quantum Cloning transformation realizes a fully tunable cloning map whose asymmetry\u2014and hence the fidelities of the two output clones\u2014is controlled continuously by the beam-splitter reflectivities and the internal phase shift \u03c6.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Implementing an Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch via Photonic-Controlled Superposition of Swap Orders\n\nAbstract: We report a PytHeus-compatible demonstration of the \u201centanglement-switch quantum switch,\u201d in which a single-photon control qubit coherently superposes two entanglement-swapping sequences (B\u2192C\u2192D vs. C\u2192B\u2192D) across four nodes A, B, C, D, thereby distributing a Bell pair |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9 between A and D in an indefinite causal order.

By correlating the joint Bell outcomes at B and D with the local measurement results at A and C, this configuration realizes the target \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d square\u2010network Bell inequality, constituting the first photonic demonstration of nonlocal correlations around a cycle without feedback or cavities."

Furthermore, photonic quantum technology is a main player in the second quantum revolution, promising the development of better sensors, secure communications, and quantum-enhanced computation. These endeavors require generating specific quantum states or efficiently performing quantum tasks. The design of the corresponding optical experiments was historically powered by human creativity but is recently being automated with advanced computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. While several computer-designed experiments have been experimentally realized, this approach has not yet been widely adopted by the broader photonic quantum optics community. The main roadblocks consist of most systems being closed-source, inefficient, or targeted to very specific use-cases that are difficult to generalize. Here, we overcome these problems with a highly-efficient, open-source digital discovery framework PyTheus, which can employ a wide range of experimental devices from modern quantum labs to solve various tasks. This includes the discovery of highly entangled quantum states, quantum measurement schemes, quantum communication protocols, multi-particle quantum gates, as well as the optimization of continuous and discrete properties of quantum experiments or quantum states. PyTheus produces interpretable designs for complex experimental problems which human researchers can often readily conceptualize. \\pytheus is an example of a powerful framework that can lead to scientific discoveries -- one of the core goals of artificial intelligence in science. We hope it will help accelerate the development of quantum optics and provide new ideas in quantum hardware and technology.\n%We introduce \\pytheus-an artificial discovery algorithm, to design 100 quantum optics experiments. This project would have been even more difficult in base 12.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\n\\def\\thefootnote{$\\S$}\\footnotetext{These authors contributed equally to this work.\\\\ The order was decided by a coin flip.}\\def\\thefootnote{\\arabic{footnote}}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\tableofcontents\n\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\nPhotons, the individual particles of light, have long been used as the core player for fundamental experiments and applications in quantum information science \\cite{pan2012multiphoton}. Photons do not easily interact with their environments; therefore, they can be distributed over large distances -- which makes them a key resource for long-distance quantum communication \\cite{liao2017satellite,liao2018satellite} and experiments that require strict Einstein locality conditions \\cite{hensen2015loophole,shalm2015strong,giustina2015significant}. Using advanced measurement-based quantum computing schemes, photons are among the most promising candidates for future quantum computers \\cite{bartolucci2021fusion}. Entanglement between two or more photons can be produced without a vacuum or cooling, and therefore many advanced experimental results can be achieved directly with table-top setups. Furthermore, the bosonic nature of photons allows for the generation of complex entangled quantum states of indistinguishable photons that are a key resource for quantum-enhanced measurements \\cite{polino2020photonic}. These potential applications have lead to enormous technological advances in integrated chips for fast and precise control of photonic quantum states \\cite{SchaeffIntegrated,wang2018integrated,wang2020integrated,pelucchi2022potential}, high-quality single-photon sources \\cite{wang2019towards,arakawa2020progress,tomm2021bright,uppu2021quantum}, novel photon-pair sources \\cite{santiago2022resonant}, photon number resolving detectors \\cite{singlephotons2011,slussarenko2019photonic}, and advanced high-quality multi-photon interference  \\cite{bouchard2020two,menssen2017distinguishability,feng2021observation,qian2023multiphoton}.\n\nOne question now is how to utilize these technologies to build up exciting new experiments for the foundations of quantum physics and practical quantum hardware.\n\nHistorically, the design of quantum experiments strongly relied on the intuition and creativity of human experts who leverage their experience and come up with blueprints of experiments. However, due to the unintuitive phenomena and enormous combinatorial space of the potential designs, it becomes extremely difficult for human researchers to discover more complex quantum setups. It might be possible that there are high-quality solutions to experimental design questions far outside of the region where humans' intuition fails. How could we possibly find such extraordinary solutions?\n\nThis question has sparked a strong interest in the automated discovery of quantum experiments with computers, overviewed in \\cite{krenn2020computer}. The invention of these tools for quantum optics experiments \\cite{Melvin2016} have indeed overcome experimental limitations and allowed for new avenues in laboratories for entanglement research \\cite{babazadeh2017high,srv332experimentmalik,erhard3dghz,kysela2020path}. One crucial question is whether we can also learn something about physics from these tools. And indeed, several new concepts have been published that were purely discovered through automated design \\cite{Melvin2016}, such as a new general idea of entanglement structure \\cite{krenn2017entanglement}, and generalized constructions of photonic quantum gates \\cite{gao2020computer}. Those concepts were discovered by tedious analysis of the computer's solutions, which was time-consuming. The problem was that the algorithms were powerful enough to find unknown solutions but had no incentive to present a simple, human-understandable form of it.\n\nThis was solved by the invention of \\theseus \\cite{theseus}, an efficient algorithm for the discovery of new quantum experiments that can readily be interpreted by humans. The key insight was a shift in the representation. Rather than describing quantum experiments as quantum optical components on an optical table, experiments are described as graphs of correlations between photons. This representation, which has been a derivative of a computer-discovered concept itself, was developed in \\cite{graphs1,graphs2,graphs3} -- and allows working with a much more natural representation, which can be translated back at any point to an experiment consisting of optical elements. (It should be noted that the representation is independent of photonic graph states for measurement-based quantum computing \\cite{raussendorf2001one,raussendorf2003measurement,briegel2009measurement}, and it is so far unknown how to translate among them.)\n\nIn this paper, we introduce \\pytheus\\footnote{GitHub:\\\\ \\url{https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus}}, a highly-efficient, open-source, automated design and discovery framework for quantum optics experiments. At the core, \\pytheus uses a much extended graph-based representation of quantum optics, which allows us not only to represent entanglement and quantum gates, but lets us design quantum measurements, quantum communication protocols, optimize experimental properties, and discover quantum systems that involve single-photon sources, mixed states, and states entangled in the photon-number basis. Besides the advances of the scientific scope, we note that \\pytheus is written in \\textsc{Python}, and therefore can readily be combined with machine learning frameworks such as \\textsc{TensorFlow} and \\textsc{PyTorch}, and allows for immediate parallelization in computer clusters.\n\nTo showcase the applicability of \\pytheus, we demonstrate the discovery of 100 previously unknown or advanced implementations of quantum optics experiments, ranging from exciting new systems for entanglement research to quantum states from condensed matter physics that are interesting for quantum simulation purposes, new ways of performing quantum communication tasks such as entanglement swapping, new quantum state measurements, and quantum gates. The experiments can involve both probabilistic photon sources and deterministic single-photon sources, and many of them are readily implementable in today's modern quantum optics labs. In the GitHub repository, we present the instructions for \\pytheus that discover each of the examples. We hope that \\pytheus's efficiency, generality, and low entry barrier kick-starts the application of computer-discovered quantum setups in experimental laboratories worldwide, and inspires new exciting computer-inspired ideas and directions for fundamentals and applications of photonic quantum physics research.\n\nWhile the goal of this paper was to demonstrate the discovery capability of \\pytheus, in several cases, it was impossible \\textit{not} to \\textit{see} clear generalizations and reasons why the solutions work. We show this in some cases below. One of the exceptionally interesting concepts we discovered was a new quantum multiphoton interference effect that can simulate probabilistic multi-pair sources just with photon pairs. We describe this new physics concept and its application in a parallel paper \\cite{halopaper}.\n\nThe article is structured in the following way: In section \\ref{section:graphs}, we introduce the graph-based representation of quantum optics, which lies at the heart of \\pytheus. In section \\ref{sec:pytheus}, we introduce the idea of the computational \\pytheus framework, which we then apply to the discovery of 100 new quantum experiments in section \\ref{100exp}. In section \\ref{sec:outlook}, we explain some future(istic) ideas that might lie ahead of us.\n\n\\subsection{Related Work}\nThe first automated and artificial-intelligence-driven design methods for new quantum experiments were introduced in 2016 (for a more detailed review on the topic see \\cite{krenn2020computer,krenn2023artificial}). One of them, \\melvin, was focused on specific photonic quantum information tasks such as quantum state generation and quantum transformations, using discrete learning techniques \\cite{Melvin2016}. The second one, \\textit{Tachikoma}, focused on the discovery of new experimental setups for quantum metrology tasks and used genetic algorithms for discrete optimization \\cite{knott2016search}. \\textit{Tachikoma} has been expanded to incorporate neural network surrogate models to speed up the search process for new quantum-enhanced measurements \\cite{o2019hybrid,nichols2019designing}. At the same time, the ideas of \\melvin have led to numerous implementations of experiments in various laboratories \\cite{babazadeh2017high,srv332experimentmalik,erhard3dghz,kysela2020path} and the extraction of new ideas and concepts in quantum physics \\cite{krenn2017entanglement, gao2020computer}. Automated design tools have helped to build new ways to perform quantum information tasks such as quantum cloning \\cite{zhan2020experimental}. Compared to these tools, \\pytheus does not work on the discrete search space. Discrete spaces are very challenging to navigate as gradients cannot be used. Rather, \\pytheus uses domain knowledge in the form of a new physics-inspired representation that is entirely continuous.%Therefore the search process is significantly faster.\n\nThese ideas have later been expanded by using reinforcement-learning \\cite{melnikov2018active, melnikov2020setting}, for quantum communication \\cite{wallnofer2020machine,valcarce2022automated}, recurrent neural networks \\cite{adler2021quantum}, and deep generative models such as variational autoencoders \\cite{flam2022learning} or logical AI \\cite{cervera2021design}. Compared to these tools, \\pytheus uses direct optimization on the outputs of a physical simulator and does not rely on learned simulators or strategies. That makes it significantly faster.\n\nVarious quantum physics groups and companies have also developed simulators and optimizers since. A main focus there is on the design of experimental settings for photonic quantum computing \\cite{arrazola2019machine,Killoran2019strawberryfields,Quandela_Perceval, BudapestQuantumComputingGroup_Piquasso}. One remarkable simulator is \\textit{Strawberryfields} \\cite{Killoran2019strawberryfields}, which is focused on design and optimization tasks for continuous-variable photonic quantum computing and quantum machine learning tasks. Recent updates include auto-differentiation which significantly speeds up the rate of optimization. A related software package is \\cite{walrus}, which allows for fast computation of tasks related to Gaussian boson sampling. Compared to these tools, the focus of \\pytheus is different. \\pytheus is built for discrete-variable quantum optics, and not targeted to photonic quantum computing (or boson sampling tasks). Furthermore, one main motivation is the interpretability of the discovered results, which is achieved via a topological optimization on the graph-based representation.\n\nAn alternative methodology that focuses not only on the design question but also on understanding the underlying physical concepts is \\theseus \\cite{theseus}. There, the algorithm employs a graph-based representation to describe photonic experiments, and the final results are topologically simplified graphs that can be interpreted and conceptualized in a much more straightforward way than representations that work directly on the optimization of optical elements. Compared to \\theseus, \\pytheus expands this idea and applies it to many new situations, inaccessible before, such as the design of quantum measurement and communication setups via the Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism.\n\nRelated work has shown how quantum computers could overcome the enormous computational of designing quantum optical hardware \\cite{kottmann2021quantum}. \n\\pytheus relies, for now, on classical computers, but recent hardware advances might enable the execution of tools like \\pytheus on quantum hardware \\cite{bao2023very}.\n\n\\section{Graphs and Quantum Experiments}\\label{section:graphs}\n\\begin{table}[!b]\n\\renewcommand{\\arraystretch}{1.1}\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}\n     \\hline\n        \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{\\textbf{Graph theory}} &  \\textbf{Experiment} \\\\ \\hline\n        \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{\\!\\!color weighted graph\\!\\!}&quantum experiment\\\\ \\hline\n        \\multirow{6}{*}{\\!\\!vertex\\!\\!}& \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[circle, fill=white, thick, draw=black,  scale=1.1](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture} &\\! path to photodetector\\! \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n        \n        & \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[circle, fill=white, thick, draw=black, dotted, scale=1.1](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture} &\\! heralded optical path*\\! \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n       \n        &  \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[regular polygon,regular polygon sides=3, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=0.7](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& \\!single photon source \\! \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n       \n        &  \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[regular polygon,regular polygon sides=3, fill=white, thick, draw=black, dotted, scale=0.7](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& incoming photon  \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n        \n       & \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[regular polygon,regular polygon sides=4, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=1](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture}&  ancillary photodetector \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n        \n       & \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[regular polygon,regular polygon sides=6, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=1](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& \\!\\! number resolving detector\\!\\! \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n       \n       & \\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[star, star points=10, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=0.8](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& \\!environment interaction \\!\\! \\\\\\hline\n        \\multirow{4}{*}{edge} & color& internal mode number\\\\\\cline{2-3}\n         &\\! weight $\\in\\mathbb{C}$ \\!& amplitude** \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n         \n         &\\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n        \\draw[-,draw=black,line width=0.4mm] (-1.1,0) -- (-0.,0);\n        \\node[diamond, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=0.6](1) at (-0.5,0) {};\n        \\end{tikzpicture} & negative amplitude \\\\\\cline{2-3}\n        \n         &\\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[circle, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=1.1](1) at (-1,0) {};\n         \\node[circle, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=1.1](1) at (0,0) {};\n        \\draw[-,draw=black,line width=0.4mm] (-0.82,0) -- (-0.18,0);\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& correlated photon pair\\\\\\cline{2-3}\n    \n         &\\begin{tikzpicture}[baseline={([yshift=-.5ex]current bounding box.center)}]\n         \\node[regular polygon,regular polygon sides=3, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=0.7](1) at (-1,0) {};\n         \\node[circle, fill=white, thick, draw=black, scale=1.1](1) at (0,0) {};\n         \\draw[-,draw=black,line width=0.4mm] (-0.82,0) -- (-0.15,0);\n        \\end{tikzpicture}& single photon path\\\\\\hline\n       \n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{The correspondence between graph theory and quantum experiments. *For some experiments one must known the total amount of photons crossing a group of optical paths (see section \\ref{sec:noon_states}).

In the graph-experiment representation, each colored weighted graph corresponds to a quantum experimental setup, and \\textit{vice versa}. Each edge and each vertex of the graph represent a correlated photon pair and a photon path, respectively. Its complex weight denotes the amplitude of the photon pair, and the edge color represents a photon's internal mode number for a given path, which corresponds to the photon's degree of freedom such as polarization \\cite{polarizationERP1995}, path \\cite{wang2018integrated,lu2020three,pelucchi2022potential}, transverse spatial modes \\cite{rubinsztein2016roadmap,padgett2017orbital,bouchard2017high,bavaresco2018measurements}, time-bin \\cite{timebin1989} or frequency \\cite{frequencybin2010,santiago2022resonant}. This abstract graph representation allows us to have the full information of quantum optical experiments and has been used for discovering quantum states and transformations \\cite{theseus}. At first glance, it might seem that there is fundamentally no difference between the path degree of freedom (which is encoded as vertices) and the internal degrees of freedom of photons (which are encoded as colors of edges). However, this is only true information theoretically. Physically, the path degree of freedom is exceptional, because it allows to add spatially separation between photons and thereby perform non-locality experiments.\n\n\nHere we significantly extend the bridge between graphs and experiments, which allows us to perform design and discovery tasks for quantum state generation (for pure and mixed states and on the photon number basis), quantum measurements, quantum communication protocols, and gates for quantum computing. In Table.~\\ref{tab:graph-experiment-link}, we show the correspondence between graph theory and quantum experiments. The graph representation can be directly translated into different experimental implementations. In the remaining part of this section, we explain how these graphs encode quantum states, and how to translate them to experimental setups.\n\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum State Generation} \\label{sec:stategeneration}\n\\subsubsection{Probabilistic Photon-Pair Sources} \\label{sec:p2ps}\n\nProbabilistic photon-pair sources, which are typically based on nonlinear processes such as spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing (FWM) \\cite{boyd2020nonlinear}, are one of the most widespread resources to generate entangled and correlated pairs of photons. A range of photonic quantum experiments using probabilistic sources can be interpreted as a weighted colored graph \\cite{theseus,graphs1,graphs2,graphs3}. There, each vertex represents an optical path to a detector and each edge refers to the correlated photon pair produced by a probabilistic photon-pair source. The edge weight is the amplitude associated with the photons, and the edge color describes the photon's internal mode number (i.e., the degree of freedom of a photon). The connection between the graph and the corresponding quantum state is given by the weight function \\cite{theseus}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})=\\sum_m \\frac{1}{m!} \\left( \\sum_{e \\in E(G)} \\omega(e) x^\\dagger(e) y^\\dagger(e) + \\text{h.c.}\\right)^m,\n    \\label{eq:weightfunction}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $E(G)$ is the set of edges of the graph. The quantum state is obtained by applying the weight function to the vacuum, i.e. $\\ket{\\psi}=\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\ket{\\text{vac}}$. The term h.c. stands for hermitian conjugate, which includes annihilation operators. As an example of states using four path (i.e., $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$) with two-dimensional internal modes (i.e., $0$ and $1$) in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}, the $\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\omega)}$ is given as\n\\begin{align}\n    \\Phi(\\boldsymbol{\\omega})\\approx\\sum_{N}&\\frac{1}{N!}( \\omega_{a,b}^{0,0}a^\\dagger_0 b^\\dagger_0 + \\omega_{b,d}^{1,1}b^\\dagger_1 d^\\dagger_1 \\notag \\\\\n    &+ \\omega_{c,d}^{0,0}c^\\dagger_0 d^\\dagger_0 + \\omega_{a,c}^{1,1}c^\\dagger_1 a^\\dagger_1 + \\text{h.c.})^N,\n    \\label{eq:pairsource}\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}=(\\omega_{a,b}^{0,0},\\omega_{b,d}^{1,1},\\omega_{c,d}^{0,0},\\omega_{a,c}^{1,1})$ is a list of edge weights $\\omega_{x,y}^{i,j}\\in\\mathbb{C}$ and $|\\omega_{x,y}^{i,j}|^2<1$, the superscript and subscript represent the mode number and the optical path, respectively. $x^\\dagger_{k}$ is the creation  operator of a photon in path $x$ with mode $k$. The pair-emission process is up to the $\\text{N}$-order, and the probability of occurrence for lower-order events is higher than that of higher-order ones. In principle, the hermitian conjugate terms influence the final state. However, for the low pump regime, the effect of the annihilation terms is negligible in many cases. For example this is the case when the final state is conditioned on having a photon in every detector. In all of the examples that we present here, it is safe to neglect the annihilation operators. \n\nAn alternative method to compute these systems in a non-approximate way is to follow the Takagi decomposition (see \\cite{PhysRevA.100.032326}, specifically Eq.27) , which leads to reliable solutions also in the strong-pump regime. Naturally, this method is more expensive to compute. In our manuscript, we do not need to use this more involved method, as the low-pump approximation holds with high accuracy. \n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{graph_2d4pGHZ_example.pdf} \n \\caption {An abstract graph representation of quantum experiments producing GHZ states. There, edges and vertices represent correlated photon-pair and optical paths, respectively. The edge colors and weights $\\boldsymbol\\omega$ are mode numbers and complex coefficients. The blue and red colors refer to the mode numbers 0 and 1, respectively. There are two perfect matchings (i.e., a subgraph that covers all vertices only once), and their coherent superposition leads to a quantum state $\\ket{\\psi}=\\omega_{a,b}^{0,0} \\omega_{c,d}^{0,0} \\ket{0000} + \\omega_{a,c}^{1,1} \\omega_{b,d}^{1,1}\\ket{1111}$ (without normalization). We can get a four-qubit GHZ state by setting all weights equal. The graph can be translated into several quantum setups with different technologies, such as entanglement by path identity or path encoding used in integrated photonics or standard bulk optics (e.g., using polarization encoding). The squares I-IV are probabilistic sources that create photon pairs. For clearer presentation, we draw the source in the color corresponding to the mode they contribute.}\n \\label{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}\n\\end{figure}\nExperimentally, a common way to obtain a quantum state is to condition the experimental results on a simultaneous detection event in each detector, which is also called the $n$-fold coincidence detection. In our graph representation, this only happens when a subset of the edges contains each of the $n$ vertices exactly once (see the subset of blue edges or red edges in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}), which is the so-called perfect matching of a graph. For the example in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}, we neglect the empty mode and higher-order terms $N>2$ to post-select the quantum state. There are two perfect matchings (two blue edges and two red edges) in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}, which contribute to two quantum terms $\\ket{0000}$ and $\\ket{1111}$. The weight of a perfect matching is the product of all its edge weights. For each term in a quantum state, the weight is given by the sum of all weights of the perfect matchings that contribute to it. Therefore, the weights for quantum terms $\\ket{0000}$ and $\\ket{1111}$ are $\\omega_{a,b}^{0,0} \\omega_{c,d}^{0,0}$ and $\\omega_{a,c}^{1,1} \\omega_{b,d}^{1,1}$, respectively. In the end, a coherent superposition of the two perfect matchings in the graph leads to the post-selected quantum state, which is\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\psi}\\approx\\omega_{a,b}^{0,0} \\omega_{c,d}^{0,0} \\ket{0000} + \\omega_{a,c}^{1,1} \\omega_{b,d}^{1,1}\\ket{1111}.\n    \\label{eq:2dGHZ}\n\\end{equation} \nIf we set all weights the same and normalize the state, we can then reach a four-particle Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. \n\n\\paragraph{Translation to Experiments --}\\label{sec:translation} A colored weighted graph can directly be translated into several quantum optical experiments using different technologies \\cite{theseus}, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}. The most straightforward way is applying the concept of entanglement by path identity \\cite{krenn2017entanglement, kysela2020path,RevModPhysPI2022}, for which the graph representation has initially been designed \\cite{graphs1}. In this scheme shown on the left side of Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}, paths of indistinguishable photons produced from multiple crystals are overlapped, leading to a coherent superposition of possible origins for a photon. Equipped with the graph-experimental correspondence in Table \\ref{tab:graph-experiment-link}, we now translate four edges and vertices into four photon-pair sources and optical paths. Here, we encode photon's internal mode number in polarization such that blue and red edge colors in the graph depict horizontal and vertical polarization, respectively. The four sources are set up in such a way that two sources (blue edges) produce photons with states $\\ket{00}$ while the other two (red edges) produce photons with states $\\ket{11}$. We then pump all sources coherently and consider that two of the four sources produce a photon pair in this example. Conditionally on perfect matching or post-selection, we have only two cases (two-photon pairs come either from the sources I and II or from the sources III and IV) that contribute to the final quantum state in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:2dGHZ}. All other combinations of sources do not lead to only one photon in each of the detectors. For example, a photon pair in crystals I and III leads to two photons in $a$, one photon in $b$, and $c$, but no photon in $d$; therefore, this case is disregarded. If the mode numbers are indistinguishable, one can observe a new form of multi-photon interference, which has first been experimentally observed in \\cite{feng2021observation,qian2023multiphoton} and which forms the basis of many of the proposed experiments below.\n\nAnother promising technology is using integrated photonic, which usually uses path encoding \\cite{SchaeffIntegrated,wang2018integrated,wang2020integrated,pelucchi2022potential}, where each photon's one mode goes to one detector, as shown in the bottom middle-part of Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}. In this example, each photon has two path modes depicted in blue and red colors, respectively. Therefore, one can consider that each vertex in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example} actually contains two sub-detectors that directly connect to the paths for the photon's two-mode numbers (i.e., blue and red paths). The vertex is activated when only one of the two sub-detectors clicks. In this way, perfect matching means the situations where four sub-detectors click in either blue paths or red paths, leading to the desired quantum state. Moreover, one can also use the standard bulk optics for generating photonic entanglement \\cite{tenghzprl,tenghzoptica}. When the edges are in the same color, which means the corresponding photons have the same mode number, one can use either probabilistic beam splitters or directly path-identified photon-pair sources to form the edge. If the edges have different colors (for example, two-mode numbers in Fig.~\\ref{fig:Twodim_graph_pm_example}), one can employ mode-dependent beam splitters such as polarizing beam splitters (PBSs) and transverse spatial mode sorters \\cite{crosscrystal1999,pan2012multiphoton} to create an edge. With polarization encoding in the example, we can insert a PBS between two cross-crystal sources \\cite{crosscrystal1999}, for the state generation. Yet, such a translation is not unique, and an expert may further simplify the proposed setup. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{graph_3d6pGHZ_example_withK.pdf} \n \\caption {Asymptotic solution for quantum experiments producing a three-dimensional six-particle GHZ state. All edges have weights $k$ but those labelled as $\\omega$.

To minimize the amplitude of the undesired term the weights must fulfill $k^2\\omega>\\omega^3$. Moreover, $k^2\\omega>k^4$ to guarantee that (N$>\\!\\!3$)-order terms from Eq.\\eqref{eq:pairsource} are also negligible.} \n \\label{fig:epsilon_ghz_graph}\n\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Asymptotic Solutions --} Until now, we know that each perfect matching can contribute to a term of the quantum state, and their coherent superposition gives the desired state. With the above graph-experimental link, one now expects to produce arbitrary multi-particle entanglement in high dimensions, e.g., a six-particle three-dimension GHZ state. A GHZ state appears when all perfect matchings are disjoint, i.e., every edge is used only in one perfect matching \\cite{graphs1,graphs2}. However, it has been shown that it is impossible to construct a graph of more than four vertices with only three disjoint perfect matchings \\cite{graphs1,graphs2}. Fig.~\\ref{fig:epsilon_ghz_graph} exemplifies this point. Three disjoint perfect matchings contribute to the desired quantum terms. However, there is another perfect matching that leads to an additional term that is not part of the GHZ state (the so-called Maverick term \\cite{graphs1}). While we cannot fully erase the term, and therefore achieve a GHZ state with perfect fidelity, we can reduce the weight of the undesired term. Yet, one must be cautious with (N$>\\!\\!3$)-order terms from Eq.\\eqref{eq:pairsource}, since they also need to be smaller than the GHZ state terms we are targeting. These two constraints boil down to the inequalities $k^2>\\omega^2$ and $\\omega>k^2$, respectively, which are both experimentally feasible. We call this and similar graphs \\textit{asymptotic solutions}(Fig.~\\ref{fig:epsilon_ghz_graph}) . %This concept can be applied to many different multi-particle states with higher dimensions. \n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{graph_6ph3dim2anc_example.pdf} \n \\caption{An abstract graph for producing a three-dimensional six-particle GHZ state with two ancillary particles. The diamonds along the edges represent that the edge weights are negative. Vertices 6 and 7 depicted by squares are for ancillas, which are in the same mode number (e.g., blue color for mode number 0). Five perfect matchings in black boxes contribute to the three terms in the desired GHZ state, while the rest of the perfect matchings are destructively canceled out.} \n \\label{fig:ancilla_ghz_graph}\n\\end{figure}\n\\paragraph{Ancillary Particles --} Although there is a limitation to the state generation with standard linear optics and post-selection in the graph representation \\cite{graphs2, calsamiglia2002generalized}, one can further employ ancillary particles to completely get rid of Maverick terms \\cite{halopaper, paesani2021scheme}. For example, assisted with two ancillary photons, we can obtain the six-particle three-dimension GHZ state (details see Fig.~\\ref{fig:ancilla_ghz_graph}). Additionally, to create quantum states with an odd number of particles, one can just use some odd numbers of photons produced from photon-pair sources as ancillary particles \\cite{graphs3}. We present further examples in section \\ref{100exp}.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{Deterministic Single-Photon Sources}\\label{sec:single_photon}\n\\begin{figure}[!t] \n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{graph_sps_example.pdf} \n \\caption{An abstract graph for quantum experiments producing a Bell state with single-photon sources. The vertices $\\text{SPS}_{d}$ and $\\text{SPS}_{c}$ described as triangles stand for the incoming path for single-photon sources while vertices $a$ and $b$ stand for the optical paths. No edges are allowed between input vertices $\\text{SPS}_{d}$ and $\\text{SPS}_{c}$. The perfect matchings in this graph lead to a two-dimensional Bell state. The corresponding experiments are listed below. Experimentally, a single-photon source can be either a heralded single-photon source implemented with a photon-pair source and a photon-number-resolving detector (PNRD) or a deterministic single-photon source which can be an ideal quantum-dot-based source. In this experiment, the two photons arrive at the same time (and have the same wavelength, polarization, and spatial mode) such that they are indistinguishable.} \n \\label{fig:single_photon}\n\\end{figure}\nIn the above section \\ref{sec:p2ps}, we have treated an edge in a graph as a probabilistic photon-pair source (in general, as the correlated photon pair) and a vertex for an optical path connecting to a single-photon (non)sensitive detector. Experimentally, one can construct a single-photon source that relies on a probabilistic photon-pair source, where one photon is detected heralds the presence of the other \\cite{singlephotons2011}. For example, the single-photon source in path $\\text{SPS}_{d}$ ($\\text{SPS}_{c}$) is conditionally on the detection of only one photon in the path $d$ ($c$) using a probabilistic photon-pair source and a photon-number-resolving detector, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:single_photon}. In the graph representation, one can consider that there is an edge between the vertex $\\text{SPS}_{d}$ ($\\text{SPS}_{c}$) and a virtual vertex which always needs to have exactly one incoming edge. For simplicity, we can just use a input vertex (e.g., $\\text{SPS}_{d}$ or $\\text{SPS}_{c}$, without drawing its adjacent virtual vertex) for such a single-photon source based on a probabilistic photon-pair source, see Fig.~\\ref{fig:single_photon}. There are no connecting edges between two input vertices. The edge connecting to an input vertex is reinterpreted as photons propagate towards a detector \\cite{theseus,chin2021graph}. \n\nInterestingly, this can also be explained in Klyshko's advanced-wave picture, described as ``an intuitive treatment of two-photon correlation with the help of the concept of an effective field acting upon one of the two detectors and formed by parametric conversion of the advanced wave emitted by the second detector'' \\cite{belinskii1994two,arruda2018klyshko}. In other words, we can treat an edge as a quantum information transfer of one single system; thus, one can describe many abstract quantum information flows instead of just probabilistic photon-pair sources. In general, our input vertex representation is directly applicable to deterministic single-photon sources such as the ideal on-demand sources based on semiconductor quantum dots \\cite{wang2019towards,arakawa2020progress,tomm2021bright,uppu2021quantum} or multiplexed single-photon sources \\cite{meyer2020single}. Therefore, \\pytheus can design experiments that use single-photon sources. \n\n\n\\subsubsection{Mixed States}\\label{sec:mixed}\nSo far, we have considered coherent creation processes, resulting in pure states. However, experimentally it is possible to introduce incoherence. Whenever distinguishing information about the quantum state escapes from the experiment to the environment, a partial trace of the density matrix is performed, producing a mixed state. This fact can be used systematically in the graph representation. To do so, we dedicate one of the vertices as the environment (environment vertex). We produce the full quantum state\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\psi} = \\ket{\\psi_0}\\ket{0}_{\\text{env}}+\\ket{\\psi_1}\\ket{1}_{\\text{env}}+\\ket{\\psi_2}\\ket{2}_{\\text{env}}+\\ldots.\n\\end{equation}\nThen, tracing out the environment contribution, we obtain\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\rho = \\ket{\\psi_0}\\bra{\\psi_0}+\\ket{\\psi_1}\\bra{\\psi_1}+\\ket{\\psi_2}\\bra{\\psi_2}+\\ldots .\n\\end{equation} \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{IntroMixedWithSetups.pdf} \n\t\\caption {An abstract graph for producing mixed states. The detection paths were labeled $a$, $b$, $c$, and $\\text{env}$, and internal modes described in blue and red are mode numbers 0 and 1. A mixed state can be generated by using one of the vertices as the environment (vertex env in this example). Experimentally this could be implemented by measurements that do not discriminate between the photon modes, for instance, detectors with a large active area. The corresponding setups for the graph are listed below.}\n\t\\label{fig:IntroMixedGHZ}\n\\end{figure}\n\nWe illustrate this procedure by a simple example in Fig.~\\ref{fig:IntroMixedGHZ}. From a graph that produces\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\psi} =  \\ket{000}_{abc}\\ket{0}_\\text{env}+\\ket{111}_{abc}\\ket{1}_\\text{env},\n\\end{equation}\nwe trace out the last photon obtaining\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\rho_{000111} = \\ket{000}\\bra{000}+\\ket{111}\\bra{111}.\n    \\label{eqIntroMixedGHZ}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis procedure is experimentally achieved by using detectors that do not distinguish between the modes in vertex $\\text{env}$. For example, if spatial modes are used, one can use a wide-area photon detector or multi-mode fibers in front of the detector. If the time degree of freedom is used to encode the mode numbers, one can integrate over the entire time such that one cannot distinguish between time-bins. Doing so, we introduce mixedness and recover the state in Eq.~\\eqref{eqIntroMixedGHZ}. Similarly to the translation in \\ref{sec:translation}, we can also translate the graph for creating mixed states into different schemes, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:IntroMixedGHZ}. Therefore, \\pytheus can be used to design experiments for complex and interesting mixed states.\n\n\n\n\\subsubsection{States Entangled in the Photon-Number Basis}\\label{fock_basis}\n\nFock states containing a fixed number of particles in a given spatial mode form a complete basis for many-body Hilbert spaces. The superposition of Fock states brings, among others, the well-known N00N states \\cite{Sander1989,lee2002quantum} that promise many advantages such as the best-possible quantum-enhanced precision, super-sensitivity and super-resolution \\cite{giovannetti2011advances, polino2020photonic}. The $N$-particle N00N state is (up to normalization)\n\\begin{equation}\n\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{N}_{2}:=\\ket{N,0}_{a,b}+\\ket{0,N}_{a,b},\n\\label{eq:NOON}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the subscript number $2$ means there are two paths (e.g., $a$ and $b$), $\\ket{0}$ indicates an unoccupied mode. The concept of the N00N state in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:NOON} can be extended to a multi-mode case, where $N$ particles are distributed in one of several optical paths \\cite{zhang2018scalable,hong2021quantum}.\n\nWe know the total number of photons $N$ going through a set of optical paths, but in contrast to the previous sections, we ignore how many photons occupy each of the paths. Therefore, perfect matchings are not the only contributions to the final state that we must consider. Here, we need to compute all combinations of edges that lead to a total number of $N$ photons for a given set of all optical paths. %Here we go beyond perfect matchings and simple single-photon post-selection, because in the Fock basis we naturally have cases where one mode is occupied with more than one photon.%Before, we interpreted the graphs' perfect matching as a set of states in coherent superposition. Contrarily, to compute the superposed terms that produce a Fock state, we consider all combinations of edges that generates $N$ photons on a given set of optical paths, not only the perfect matchings.\nThis includes combinations with repeated edges, which represent multiple photon pairs from the same source, and self-loops, in which a source produces a collinear photon pair \\cite{PhysRevA.60.R4209,burlakov2001collinear}. Moreover, for some contributions there can be vertices with degree zero, as long as the total number of photons -- the total degree -- is $N$. The conditioning on the total number of photons must be considered when employing the N00N states in metrology experiments, as described in previous work \\cite{polino2020photonic, afek2010high}. % Some of these photons can be produced by sources that produce more than a photon pair, which includes combinations with repeated edges, which represent multiple photon pairs from the same source, and self-loops, in which a source produces a collinear photon pair \\cite{PhysRevA.60.R4209,burlakov2001collinear}.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{graph_noon_example_new.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for producing $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{2}_{2}$ states and the related experiments. On the left side, the graph with two blue edges (i.e., two self-loops) is for a path-entangled N00N state $(\\ket{2,0}_{a,b}-\\ket{0,2}_{a,b})/\\sqrt{2}$. We translate this graph into several setups (below the graph). The setups using path identity or path encoding are the same in this case. With bulk optics, one can achieve the state with a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry \\cite{HOM1987,bouchard2020two}, where two identical photons enter a 50:50 beam splitter. One can also perform such a state in polarization, i.e., $(\\ket{2,0}_{H,V}-\\ket{0,2}_{V,H})/\\sqrt{2}$ on the right side. The blue and red colors are, respectively, for horizontal and vertical polarization. The coherent superposition of blue and red self-loops gives the N00N state. Its related setup is described below the graph. There either two horizontally polarized photons (blue edge) or two vertically polarized photons (red edge) are in path $a$ with a single-photon sensitive detector.}\n\t\\label{fig:HOMeffect}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs an example, we show a graph for the $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{2}_{2}$ state in Fig.~\\ref{fig:HOMeffect}. In this case, the total photon number is $N=2$. All edges are in the same color, thus corresponding to the standard path-entangled N00N states. A self-loop edge indicates that there are two photons in its connected vertex. Thus the coherent superposition of two photons being in one of the two vertices (one of the self-loops produced a photon-pair, but we ignore it) leads to a coherent superposition of $\\ket{2,0}_{a,b}$ and $\\ket{0,2}_{a,b}$, i.e., a two-mode two-photon N00N state. One can now translate the graph into quantum experiments, similarly, as we did in section \\ref{sec:p2ps}. In this example, the setups using entanglement by path identity and path encoding are the same. With bulk optics, one can use probabilistic beam splitters that provide the mixing between the two input photons, to bunch two photons in one of the two optical paths $a$ and $b$, which is the well-known Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) effect \\cite{bouchard2020two,HOM1987}. Moreover, we can also generate such a N00N state in polarization or transverse spatial modes instead of the path; see Fig.~\\ref{fig:HOMeffect} for details.  \n\nAs for the previous states, ancillary paths can assist in the creation of states on the photon-number basis. Here we condition the final state on the existence of a total number of photons in the non-ancilla detectors but, again, the ancilla paths are reached by single photons. Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon_2mode_3ph} shows an example in which the ancilla (vertex 3) receives only one photon, and the other two detectors get a total of three photons.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m3p1anc_example_new.pdf} \n \\caption{Graph for producing $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{3}_{2}$ state with an additional ancillary particle. The total photon number (including ancillary one) for each component in the state is four. There are six combinations of two edges that cover the ancillary vertex only once. Two of them (black box) contribute to the required terms $\\ket{3,0}$ and $\\ket{0,3}$, and the others ($\\ket{2,1}$ and $\\ket{1,2}$) inside the red box cancel out.}\n \\label{fig:noon_2mode_3ph}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Communication}\\label{sec:qcommunication}\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\textwidth]{qcomm.png} \n\t\\caption {An abstract graph for entanglement swapping. On the right, an experimental setup for entanglement swapping is shown. The two particles a and d are entangled when two ancillary detectors click. A common source of particles a and d (as shown crossed out below the setup) would circumvent the point of entanglement swapping. The two particles are to be entangled without having interacted with each other. This restriction manifests in the graph corresponding to the experiment (shown on the left). An edge between the vertices a and d (dashed line) is not permitted.}\n\t\\label{fig:qcomm}\n\\end{figure}\nIn future quantum networks that connect individual users with quantum resources and quantum computers, the distribution of quantum entanglement is essential. One key concept used in quantum communication in quantum networks is entanglement swapping \\cite{zukowski1993event,pan1998experimental}, where two qubits that never interacted can be entangled. %While such experiments have been successfully performed in the past \\cite{pan1998experimental} they open an interesting path. \nThis provides an important route for interesting tests of quantum foundations and plays an indispensable role in quantum technology such as quantum repeaters \\cite{sangouard2011quantum}.  \\pytheus allows us to explore new directions that could lead to solutions that require fewer resources than current techniques or are implemented in surprising ways. Many quantum network communication tasks have been experimentally implemented \\cite{pan1998experimental,basset2019entanglement,llewellyn2020chip,samara2021entanglement}, thus the new solutions by \\pytheus can readily be implemented in laboratories.\n\n\nWe are interested in finding experimental setups for creating entanglement between particles that have not interacted or originated from a common source. With \\pytheus this can be done for scenarios involving higher dimensions and multiple particles. Finding the corresponding graph works analogously to the state generation task shown in section \\ref{sec:stategeneration}, but comes with extra constraints on the graph. We set an entangled state (e.g. two particles in a Bell state) as a target for the optimization. The experiment corresponding to the resulting graph should create this state. To ensure that the two particles have no direct interaction, the graph must fulfill the following additional constraint. It should have no edge connecting the two corresponding vertices. Such an edge translated to a photon pair source would mean that the two photons could come out of the same source. This is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:qcomm}. Similarly, the connection of two vertices to the same single-photon source vertex implies that they can not be space-like separated. Such constellations would not be valid for entanglement swapping, either. In the same way, as for incoming photons (single photon sources or input photons), the constraints are enforced by removing the edges from the starting graph.\n\nApproaching these tasks with \\pytheus makes it possible to explore new ways of distributing entanglement. We show the examples found by \\pytheus in section \\ref{100exp}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Measurements}\\label{sec:measurements}\nA graph may also be interpreted as a quantum measurement on an input quantum state. Such measurements are of utmost importance in many quantum communication tasks, for example, a Bell state measurement for quantum teleportation. The goal of measurements here is to distinguish different orthogonal incoming states, e.g., in the case when all detectors click simultaneously. Photons entering the experiment through input paths are represented analogously to single-photon sources introduced in section \\ref{sec:single_photon}. An input photon corresponds to one vertex in the graph. An edge connecting an input vertex to a detector vertex corresponds to the photon traveling to that detector, following Klyshko's advanced-wave picture \\cite{belinskii1994two} as explained in section \\ref{sec:single_photon}. The same constraints apply, excluding edges connecting two vertices belonging to input photons.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.35\\textwidth]{graph_bsm_example.pdf} \n\t\\caption {An abstract graph for Bell state measurement. A measurement event happens if the photons \\textbf{in1} and \\textbf{in2} are in the Bell state $\\ket{\\Psi^-}$. Simultaneous clicks in the detectors $D1$ and $D2$ signify a successful Bell measurement. The corresponding setup is given for the graph, which is a typical Bell state measurement setup.}\n\t\\label{fig:GraMeasureBellMeas2D}\n\\end{figure}\n\nAs an example, we show a graph in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GraMeasureBellMeas2D} for the well-known Bell state measurement (BSM) \\cite{weinfurter1994experimental, michler1996interferometric}, which plays an important role in many quantum information tasks. %One example of translating a graph into a Bell state measurement is shown in Fg. \\ref{fig:GraMeasureBellMeas2D}. \nWhen the two detectors click, the incoming photons are projected to one Bell state $\\ket{\\Psi^-}$, which can be seen as the generation of a state given by a superposition of the two perfect matchings in the graph. To search for an experimental setup for measuring a particular state, we let \\pytheus search for a graph that would produce the state under consideration of the topological constraints on the graph. The graph in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GraMeasureBellMeas2D} interpreted as state generation would produce the state $\\ket{\\Psi^-}$ under the condition that there is no connection between vertices in1 and in2. \n\nWith a graph that `produces' the state $ \\ket{\\varphi}_{in}$, we can effectively perform a projective measurement ($P_0=\\ketbra{\\varphi}$ and $P_1=\\mathbb{I} - \\ketbra{\\varphi}$) on the input photons. A coincidence of all detectors corresponds to the output 0 and any other pattern is interpreted as output 1.\n\nThe representation of measurements in terms of graphs constitutes an extension of the previous interpretation given in \\cite{theseus}. This allows us to use \\pytheus for the discovery of measurement setups for any state and various constraints and conditions.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Computation}\\label{sec:gates}\nQuantum gates are a crucial building block in quantum computation \\cite{nielsen2010quantum,knill2001scheme}. A quantum gate performs a unitary transformation on an input state. These transformations can also be interpreted in terms of graphs. In these graphs, similar to measurements (described in subsection \\ref{sec:measurements}), the input photons are described by designated vertices. Likewise, we impose restrictions on which types of vertices can be connected by edges. Photons exiting the setup (output) are also represented by vertices, as in state generation. Additional ancillary photons can stem from probabilistic photon-pair sources and single-photon sources can also be involved. With \\pytheus we can search for arbitrary quantum gates under a wide range of experimental conditions.\n\nA target unitary quantum gate acting on an $N$-dimensional Hilbert space is specified by how each element of an orthonormal basis transforms. One canonical example in quantum gates is the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which acts on two qubits and is described by the mapping:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\ket{00} \\rightarrow \\ket{00}, \\\\\n    \\ket{01} \\rightarrow \\ket{01}, \\\\\n    \\ket{10} \\rightarrow \\ket{11}, \\\\\n    \\ket{11} \\rightarrow \\ket{10}.\n\\end{align*}\nTo find this gate, we let \\pytheus search for a graph that would produce the state \n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{00}\\ket{00} + \\ket{01}\\ket{01} + \\ket{10}\\ket{11} + \\ket{11}\\ket{10};\n\\end{equation}\nunder consideration of the topological constraints on the graph (no connections between input photons). In Fig. \\ref{fig:qcomp}, we show an experimental setup realized \\cite{gasparoni2004realization} together with its graph representation.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{graph_cnotgates_example.pdf} \n\t\\caption {An abstract graph for a quantum CNOT gate shown on the left side. The right panels show the corresponding setup for a CNOT gate, which was realized by \\cite{gasparoni2004realization}.}\n\t\\label{fig:qcomp}\n\\end{figure}\n\nPhotonic quantum gates fall into two main categories \\cite{RevModPhys.79.135}. In a post-selected gate, the outgoing photons are detected directly after the gate. This ensures that there is exactly one photon in each path after the gate \\cite{postselectedgates,Knill2002,ralphcnot,CNOTfirst2003,Langford2005,q_mem_advantage,fredkin16,MetrologyHeraldedGate}. Because possibilities where two outgoing photons enter the same path are excluded, fewer experimental resources are required. However, this procedure destroys the outgoing state, and the particles can not be used further. The second category is heralded gates \\cite{gasparoni2004realization,PhysRevLett.94.030501,bao2007optical,gao2010teleportation,okamoto2011realization,spscnot,Zeuner2018}, where only ancillary photons are detected, and the outgoing photons of the gate remain undetected. These gates are ultimately more useful since the output state can be used further. A graph for a heralded quantum gate is harder to discover and needs more experimental resources since the looser selection rules can lead to more unwanted terms. Both types of quantum gates (post-selected and heralded) can be represented with graphs and thereby be designed using \\pytheus. Terms produced in post-selected experiments are represented by perfect matching, and terms produced in heralded experiments are represented by collections of edges that cover the ancillary vertices.\n\nThe ability to perform design for quantum measurements and quantum gates relies on an idea that state generation and state propagation are closely related \\cite{theseus}. In the experimental quantum optics community, this idea is known as Klyshko\u2019s advanced-wave picture \\cite{belinskii1994two, aspden2014experimental}, while in the quantum information science community it is often referred as Choi\u2013Jamio\u0142kowski isomorphism \\cite{jiang2013channel}.\n%\\newpage\n\n% \\begin{comment}\n\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=.92\\textwidth]{workflow.pdf}%{Graphs/workflow.pdf}\n \\caption {The \\pytheus workflow. From the number of vertices and available dimensions, \\pytheus builds the initial graph, which is fully connected except for vertex 3, which is only connected to its nearest neighbors. We impose this based on previous knowledge, but other constraints may arise depending on the available tools. Computing all the graph's perfect matchings, we find the more general state that the initial graph can produce: $\\ket{\\psi(\\omega)}$. As the loss function, we choose the \\textit{Fidelity} of the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ with respect the target: $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}$. Aiming for an interpretable graph with perfect fidelity, we iterate the weight optimization with the edge removal until we find the simplest graph that produces $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}=\\ket{\\psi(\\omega_S)}$. The available resources, the loss function and further optimization details are specified in the \\textit{Instruction Set.}}\n    \\label{fig:workflow}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\section{The PyTheus Library}\\label{sec:pytheus}\nStarting from a dense or fully connected graph, \\pytheus uses gradient descent combined with topological optimization to find minimal graphs corresponding to some target quantum experiment. The \\pytheus library greatly expands the range of applications of its predecessor, and it is significantly faster \\footnote{For an eight-dimensional three-particle highly-entangled state ($\\text{SRV}(8,5,3)$) \\pytheus was almost five times faster than the current state-of-the-art method \\cite{theseus}. Examples of higher particle numbers were not readily available for the previous method, but we expect increasingly higher advantages for \\pytheus.}. The package is written in Python and is available on GitHub for further applications and development of the source code. The graph encoding is compatible with other tools such as \\textit{The Walrus}\\cite{walrus}, a library to (among other applications) compute perfect matchings from the graphs' adjacency matrix. \\footnote{The loops' weights in the adjacency matrix must be multiplied by 2.}.\n\n\\pytheus applications range from the creation of quantum states to the design of quantum communication protocols. While diverse, all these tasks are performed following the same steps, illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow}. In this section, we explain the software workflow, which kind of loss functions we employ, and how to start using PyTheus.\n\n\\textbf{Workflow Overview} -- The \\textit{Instruction Set} file details \\textit{what} we want (e.g., a quantum state or a communication protocol) and some instructions about \\textit{how} to get it. The latter includes the entire allowed topology of the final solution, such as the type of photon sources/detectors and ancillary particles, how many of each we have, or which polarization modes can be used. It also contains the \\textit{Loss Function} to minimize (fidelity, count rate, or other metrics) as well as further optimization settings. In the example of Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow}, we want to obtain a post-selected six-particle, two-dimensional GHZ state, $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^2_6=\\ket{000000}+\\ket{111111}$. We employ 6 standard photodetectors and the photon pair sources described in section \\ref{sec:p2ps}. In this example, we also specify further topological constraints of the final solution (thus of the initial graph) -- here, vertex 3 must not have connections to vertex 0, 1 and 5. \n\n% Based on the available tools we build the most general graph possible.\nThe experimentally available topology specified in the instruction set lead to the \\textit{Initial Graph}. This weighted graph represents all possible states/experiments that can be produced with the available resources. The number of vertices, the type of edges, or which vertices can be directly connected are some of the \\textit{Topological Constraints} that one can impose on the graph or that may follow from the available tools or from the task we want to implement -- the sources described in section \\ref{sec:single_photon} and the protocols from section \\ref{sec:qcommunication} are representing examples. On the initial graph of Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow} the six vertices are connected with bicolored edges and based on previous knowledge, we only connect vertex 3 with its nearest neighbors. \n\n% From the initial graph we compute all potential events according to postselection rules.\nFrom the initial graph, $\\mathcal{G}(\\omega)$, we can compute the more general state produced by the weight function $\\Phi(\\omega)$ acting on the vacuum (see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:pairsource}). However, we do not consider the infinite terms produced by $\\Phi(\\omega)$, we only compute the creation events which fulfill certain \\textit{Conditional rules}. For example, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow} the post-selection rule results in terms for which all detectors click. These creation events are represented by the graph's perfect matchings, and produce a coherent superposition of kets leading to the state $\\ket{\\psi(\\omega)}$. We can specify more complex conditioning rules, which will be relevant, for example, for N00N states. There, we condition on states with a total final photon number in the output nodes. The conditioning rules are imposed by experimental circumstances \\ref{section:graphs}. \n\n% We can optimize the state with respect metrics like fidelity or entanglement. Same for q info tasks.\nOnce we extract a general state $\\ket{\\psi(\\omega)}$ from the initial graph, we can optimize it according to some \\textit{Loss Function}. As in  Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow} we seek a particular state, $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}$, we maximize the \\textit{Fidelity} of our state accordingly: $F=|\\braket{\\text{GHZ}}{\\psi(\\omega)}|^2$. To find a specific states we can also use the \\textit{Count Rate}, a metric that approximates how often our experiment produces such a state. Alternatively, we can maximize physical properties like entanglement rather than looking for a specific state. To perform quantum information tasks like measurements or communication protocols, we must translate each task into a state creation process -- see sections \\ref{sec:measurements}, \\ref{sec:qcommunication}, and \\ref{sec:gates} for further details.\n\n% We optimize the weights while looking for the simplest (and more interpretable) graph.\nIf the available experimental resources suffice, by optimizing the weights, we will find a graph that satisfies our needs. However, the optimal solution is not unique, and even if many of the weights vanish, we will likely obtain a very dense final graph, which will be hard to interpret. Therefore, to extract useful insights from our setups, we must simplify the graphs as much as possible, alternating the optimization of the weights' values with the removal of edges. This \\textit{Topological Optimization} will lead us to a simple graph, for which the removal of any additional edge would unacceptably raise the loss function's value.\n\n% Some graphs are proved to be the simplest solutions, most of the time we just try the best we can.\nFor some graphs, like the one shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:workflow}, no smaller graph can produce the target quantum \\cite{graphs1}. However, in most cases, it is challenging to ascertain whether there exists a simpler solution, especially when we choose to optimize for real weights instead of complex ones. With respect to these subtleties, following the workflow, we first generate graphs with abundant ancillary particles and reassess the results with the goal of reducing the number of resources. Using this procedure, we propose one hundred experiments to be realized in quantum optics.\n\n\n%\\subsection{Related Tools} \n\n%\\newpage\n\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n    \\centering\\resizebox{\\textwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{|cllcclclccll|}\n\\hline\n\\multicolumn{4}{|c}{\\hspace{1cm}\\subfloat[4-dimensional 4-photon GHZ state (asymptotic and exact solutions).]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_f446_boosted.pdf}}}         \n& \\multicolumn{4}{c}{\\hspace{1cm}\\subfloat[2-mode 5-photon N00N state $\\ket{50}+\\ket{05}$ (symmetric graph with an inscribed pentagram).]{\\includegraphics[width=0.21\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m5ph3anc_666_new.pdf}}}        \n& \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{\\subfloat[Post-selected CNOT quantum gate acting on a qutrit target with two ancilla photons]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot23_post.pdf}}}         \\\\\n\\multicolumn{3}{|c}{\\subfloat[A 4-qubit entangled state which requires weights with the golden ratio (or complex-valued) to be generated.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.23\\textwidth]{graph_golden.pdf}}} \n& \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\subfloat[Quantum measurement for a quantum communication task with quantum advantage (Mean King's Problem).]{\\includegraphics[width=0.23\\textwidth]{graph_MKP_3d.pdf}}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c}{\\subfloat[Entangling photons that never interacted (related to entanglement swapping) without initial Bell states.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.23\\textwidth]{graph_eswap.pdf}}} & \\multicolumn{3}{c|}{\\subfloat[Mixed state with bound entanglement that violates Bell inequality (counterexample to the Peres conjecture from 1999, solved 2014).]{\\includegraphics[width=0.23\\textwidth]{graph_peres.pdf}}} \\\\  \\hline\n\\end{tabular}%\n}\n    \\caption{A collection of seven diverse highlights, each of which is interesting in its own right.}\n    \\label{fig:highlights}\n\\end{table*}\n\n\n%\\begin{figure*}[!t]\n%\t\\centering\n%    \\subfloat[a) Four-dimensional four-photon GHZ state (overcoming the 3-dimensional barrier for multiphoton entanglement)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_f446_boosted.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%    \\subfloat[b) Heralded 3D Bell state with single photons (improves state-of-the-art design by requiring less ancilla photons)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_heralded_bell_3d_sp.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%\t\\subfloat[c) 5-photon N00N state $\\ket{50}+\\ket{05}$ (very symmetric shape with an inscribed pentagram)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m5ph3anc_666.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%\t\\subfloat[d) A 4-qubit entangled states with unit coefficients, which requires complex-valued weights for generation]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_complex4qubit.pdf}}\\\\\n%\t\\subfloat[e) Quantum measurement for a quantum communication task with quantum advantage (Mean King's Problem)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_MKP_3d.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%\t\\subfloat[f) Entanglement swapping without using two Bell states]{\\includegraphics[width=0.18\\textwidth]{graph_2dES.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%\t\\subfloat[g) Toffoli quantum gate without ancilla photons]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_toffoli_post_boosted.pdf}}\\!\\!\\hspace{0.5cm}\n%\t\\subfloat[h) Mixed state with bound entanglement that can violate a Bell inequality (counterexample to the Peres conjecture from 1999, solved 2014)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.2\\textwidth]{graph_peres.pdf}}\n%\t\\caption{A collection of eight diverse highlights, each of which is interesting in its own right. }\n%\t\\label{fig:highlights}\n%\\end{figure*}\n\\section{Hundred Experiments}\\label{100exp}\n\nIn the following, we introduce one hundred experiments conceived by \\pytheus. A broad catalog of designs that, hopefully, will contribute to multiple branches of quantum optics, including quantum computing, communications, and quantum sensing. For each proposed experimental setup which is new and has not been described in any theoretical or experimental paper, we mark the corresponding graph with a \\numberbox[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/]{number in a box} counting from 1 to 100. The weights of each graph can be found in the GitHub repository, together with the instruction sets used to search them.  \n\nWe start by showing seven highlights from our discoveries in Table.~\\ref{fig:highlights}.\n\\begin{enumerate}[(a)]\n  \\item A multi-photon entangled state that goes beyond the barrier of 3-dimensions \\cite{graphs2}. It requires only two ancillas and has a small number of edges which makes it a very promising proposal for practical application, and observation of new properties at the foundation of quantum mechanics \\cite{lawrence2014rotational}. \n  % \\item The generation of a heralded 3-dimensional GHZ state with single photon sources, which beats the current state-of-the-art method \\cite{paesani2021scheme} in number of necessary ancilla states.\n  \\item The generation of a two-mode N00N state with 5 photons. The associated graph, very symmetric, makes use of 3 ancillas.\n  \\item A post-selected 3-photon control gate (or Toffoli) that does not require any ancilla photons.\n  \\item A 4-photon qubit quantum state with equal coefficients $c=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{7}}$, that requires the ratio between certain weights to be the golden ratio. Alternatively, a lower number of complex-weighted edges can also lead to such state.\n  \\item A previously unknown quantum measurement scheme that allows the experimental implementation of a quantum communication protocol, the Mean King problem, proposed in 1987 \\cite{vaidman1987}.\n  \\item A very surprising form of quantum entanglement swapping, which does not rely on the generation of two Bell pairs and a Bell state measurement.\n  \\item Experimental setup of a 2-photon mixed entangled state that falsified the Peres conjecture \\cite{peres1999all}. The state is bound entangled (its entanglement cannot be distilled), however, it can be used to violate Bell's inequality \\cite{moroder2014steering,vertesi2014disproving}. This could lead to an experimental falsification of the Peres conjecture.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n% Many of the proposed experiments generate highly entangled quantum states of more than two dimensions and particles. The states we aim to produce have applications in a variety of quantum information tasks or provide a testing ground for more fundamental questions in quantum physics (through quantum simulation). As prominent examples, the first graph in Fig.~\\ref{fig:highlights} shows an example of a three-mode, four-particle N00N state (a); while the second generates asymptotically a four-dimensional, four-particle GHZ state(b). For the latter, we can arbitrarily increase the fidelity at the expense of the count rate, which decreases (see section \\ref{sec:p2ps}).\n\n% While most graphs optimize the fidelity or the count rate, aiming for concrete states, some are optimized according to other physical properties such as entanglement. Moreover, we can also choose loss functions that go beyond quantum mechanics, such as the assembly index, a measure of combinatorial complexity used in the study of the origins of life.\n\n% Moving beyond state generation, we propose experiments to apply projective measurements on input photons. Some of these measurements can also be used to perform entanglement swapping, the cornerstone of many quantum communication protocols. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:highlights}, we show how to perform VAA measurements(c), as well as an efficient entanglement swapping protocol for 3 pairs of Bell states(d). Finally, we devise several quantum gates acting on incoming photons Fig.~\\ref{fig:highlights}(e) exemplifies one of the possible quantum gates, namely the Toffoli gate, by \\pytheus.\n\n\\subsection{Generation of Entangled States}\nIn this part, we propose ways to generate entangled states, which play an important role not only in our understanding of entanglement and the non-local nature of quantum mechanics but also in many quantum information applications.\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{GHZ States}\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{3}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_346.pdf}}\\vspace{-5mm}\\\\\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{5}_{3}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_358.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{6}_{3}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_3610.pdf}}\\\\\n\t\\subfloat[Asymptotic $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{4}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_f446_boosted.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[Exact $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{4}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_446.pdf}}\\\\\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{3}_{5}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_538.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{5}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_5410.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {High-dimensional multiparticle GHZ states with ancillas. The weights here in these graphs are real numbers and the diamonds inserted in the edges represent the negative sign. The vertices in square refer to the detection of an ancillary photon. For the state $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{4}$ we have two possible solutions.}\n\t\\label{fig:GHZGraph}\n\\end{figure}\nBell's theorem shows that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen's propositions about local realism \\cite{epr1935} are inconsistent when we apply them to quantum systems of two particles, revealed by the violation of the Bell inequality with quantum mechanical statistical correlations \\cite{Belltheorem}. In the late 1980s, Greenberger, Horne, and Zeilinger took a step further from two to three particles. Interestingly, with a tripartite quantum system, local realism can be violated by quantum mechanics with perfect correlations rather than statistical correlation, and one can completely dispense with inequalities \\cite{ghz, greenberger1990bell}. It enables the performance of experiments where the \\textit{quantum physical predictions are mutually contradictory with expectations based on local realism} \\cite{pan2000experimental}. Such a GHZ state forms an important class of entanglement and its generalization is given as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:ghz}\n\t\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}_{n}^{d}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\ket{i}^{\\otimes n}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $n$ denotes the number of particles and $d$ is the dimension for each particle. \n\nIncreasing the number of particles and dimensions in the GHZ states not only enlarges the Hilbert space  but also leads to many new exciting classically paradoxical phenomena \\cite{ryu2014multisetting, lawrence2014rotational,lawrence2019many}. Besides their fundamental interest, high-dimensional multiparticle GHZ states have also served as an important resource for many quantum information applications \\cite{erhard2020review}.\n\nWith the size and dimension increasing, it is very challenging to know how to experimentally create GHZ states. Experimental progress has been made in this direction to push the size and dimension, especially in the linear optics regime \\cite{tenghzprl, tenghzoptica, 18qubitghz,erhard3dghz}. Until now, only the three-particle three-dimensional GHZ state has been demonstrated with linear optics \\cite{erhard3dghz} and superconducting qutrits \\cite{cervera2022experimental}. Going beyond the $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}_{3}^{3}$ state with arbitrary particle numbers and higher dimensions will give rise to exciting new possible quantum applications and new insights on the foundations of quantum mechanics.\nThis remains to be explored, in any experimental platform. \n\n\\pytheus enables the discovery of many new multi-particle high-dimensional GHZ states for which no experimental implementations are known yet. That includes the 3-particle GHZ state for 4, 5 and 6 dimensions \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_346]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_358]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_3610]{experimentcounter}, the 2 solutions (asymptotic and exact) for the 4-particle 4-dimension GHZ state \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_asym446]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_446]{experimentcounter}, and the 5-particle GHZ state for 3 and 4 dimensions \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_538]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_5410]{experimentcounter}, as shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GHZGraph}.%, and the 5-particle GHZ state for 3 and 4 dimensions \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_538]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_5410]{experimentcounter}. The associated graphs are shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:GHZGraph}. In particular, the solutions for $\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{4}_{4}$ are experimentally applicable.\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Bell Gems}\nBell states offered the first proof of the non-locality of quantum mechanics. Later on, they became the cornerstone of many quantum communication schemes and are nowadays widely used in quantum computing. These maximally entangled bipartite states, described in the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_2\\otimes\\mathcal{H}_2$, can be generalized for more particles and dimensions in multiple ways while keeping their main properties \\cite{generalbellstates}. \n\nIn 2004, Gregg Jaeger suggested a generalization for sets of $2^N$ qubits, the \\textit{Bell Gems}~\\cite{bellgems}. To construct these states we need to pick a pair of orthogonal states $\\ket{\\alpha}$ and $\\ket{\\beta}$ from the Bell basis: $\\ket{\\Phi^\\pm}=\\ket{00}\\pm \\ket{11}$ and $\\ket{\\Psi^\\pm}=\\ket{01}\\pm \\ket{10}$. Then, we iterate the following mappings in all possible ways:\n\\begin{gather}\n    \\{\\ket{\\alpha},\\ket{\\beta}\\} \\rightarrow \\left(\\ket{\\alpha}\\ket{\\alpha} \\pm \\ket{\\beta}\\ket{\\beta}\\right) \\\\\n    \\{\\ket{\\alpha},\\ket{\\beta}\\} \\rightarrow \\left(\\ket{\\alpha}\\ket{\\beta} \\pm \\ket{\\beta}\\ket{\\alpha}\\right)\n\\end{gather}\nTherefore, for $2^N$ qubits, we get a basis of $2^{2^N}$ states. For the case of a pair of 3 dimensional Bell states 84 states exist. Fig.~\\ref{fig:gem4} shows how to generate one of these high-dimensional Bell gems which, up to normalization, reads \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/BellGem3D]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\text{GEM}} = \\ket{\\psi_a}\\ket{\\psi_a} + \\ket{\\psi_b}\\ket{\\psi_b} + \\ket{\\psi_c}\\ket{\\psi_c},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\ket{\\psi_a} = \\ket{00} + \\ket{11} + \\ket{22}$, $\\ket{\\psi_b} = \\ket{01} + \\ket{12} + \\ket{20}$, and $\\ket{\\psi_c} = \\ket{02} + \\ket{10} + \\ket{21}$.\\newline\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_BellGem3D.pdf}\n \\caption {Graph corresponding to the creation of a 3 qutrit Bell gem.}\n\t\\label{fig:gem4}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%Notice that $\\ket{\\Phi^+\\Phi^+} + \\ket{\\Psi^+\\Psi^+} = \\ket{++++} + \\ket{----}$. Therefore, we can start with the graph that produces $\\ket{0000} + \\ket{1111}$, transform the edges that connect individual vertices applying a Hadamard gate, and recover the graph from figure \\label{fig:gem4}. We can also do the inverse process starting with the graph for $\\ket{\\Phi^+\\Phi^+} + \\ket{\\Psi^+\\Psi^+}$.\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Nine Ways to Entangle Four Qubits}\nIn 2001, F. Verstraete et.\\ al.\\ \\cite{4qubits9entanglements} introduced a classification of any form of entanglement between 4 qubits into nine categories. Their classification establishes an equivalence relation between states generated by reversible stochastic local quantum operations assisted by classical communication (SLOCC) operations. States inside the same category can perform the same quantum information tasks, albeit with different probabilities.\n\nOut of the nine categories, six of them include well-known quantum states: a separable state of 4 qubits, the W states of 3 and 4 qubits, the product of 2 Bell states, and the GHZ states of 3 and 4 qubits. For the 3 qubit states, the fourth particle is separable (like an ancilla). Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ent9Graphs6} shows the graphs to produce these states. \n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{0}^{\\otimes4}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_0.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{W}}_{3}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_w3.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{W}}_{4}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_w4.pdf}}\n \\\\\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\Phi^+}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_ghz22.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{2}_{3}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_ghz23.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^{2}_{4}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_ghz24.pdf}}\t\n\t\\caption {Six well-known examples from different entanglement categories described by Verstraete et.\\ al. \\cite{4qubits9entanglements}}\n\t\\label{fig:Ent9Graphs6}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe remaining three categories, out of the initial nine ones, refer to less-known ways of entanglement. Verstraete's work refers to them as $L_{a_4}$, $L_{0_{5\\oplus \\overline{3}}}$, and $L_{0_{7\\oplus \\overline{1}}}$. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:Ent9Graphs3} we see a graph for each category, producing the states \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ent9_la4real]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ent9_053]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ent9_071]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n\\ket{\\text{L}_{a_4}} &= \\ket{0001} + \\ket{0110} + \\ket{1000}, \\\\\n\\ket{\\text{L}_{0_{5\\oplus \\overline{3}}}} &= \\ket{0000} + \\ket{0101} + \\ket{1000} + \\ket{1110}, \\\\\n\\ket{\\text{L}_{7\\oplus \\overline{1}}} &= \\ket{0000} + \\ket{1011} + \\ket{1101} + \\ket{1110}. \n\\end{align}\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[$\\text{L}_{a_{4}}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_la4real.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\text{L}_{0_{5\\otimes\\overline{3}}}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_053.pdf}}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$\\text{L}_{0_{7\\otimes\\overline{1}}}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.165\\textwidth]{ent9_071.pdf}}\n\t%\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ent9_three.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for $L_{a_4}$, $L_{0_{5\\oplus \\overline{3}}}$, and $L_{0_{7\\oplus \\overline{1}}}$.}\n\t\\label{fig:Ent9Graphs3}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Quantum Error Correction}\nThe path to the quantum computer requires qubits with low error rates independent of their realization platform. However, dealing with noise on any platform is inevitable. Thus, we need error-correcting codes to protect the information and achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation. This is where \\textit{Logical Qubits} play a crucial role.\n\nLogical qubits are sets of $N$ physical qubits that define two orthogonal states $\\ket{0_L}$ and $\\ket{1_L}$. These states are defined in such a way that errors in the physical qubits can be detected by applying a set of global measurements. These measurements will produce a different combination of outcomes for each potential error, allowing its correction. The graphs from this section produce 3 well-known logical qubits to detect and correct arbitrary errors on single qubits. %They make use of 9, 7, and 5 physical errors, being the later the smallest code with such error resistance.  \n\nThe first one, the Shor code \\cite{shor1995scheme}, employs 9 physical qubits to define \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/Shor]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{0_L^{(9)}} = (\\ket{000} + \\ket{111})^{\\otimes 3},\\\\\n    \\ket{1_L^{(9)}} = (\\ket{000} - \\ket{111})^{\\otimes 3}.\n\\end{align}\n\nThe second example, the Steane code \\cite{steane1996multiple}, employs 7 physical qubits \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/Steane]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n\\ket{0_L^{(7)}} &=  \\ket{0000000} + \\ket{1010101} + \\ket{0110011} \\notag\\\\\n & + \\ket{1100110} + \\ket{0001111} + \\ket{1011010} \\notag\\\\\n & + \\ket{0111100} + \\ket{1101001}, \\\\\n\\ket{1_L^{(7)}} &=  X^{\\otimes 7} \\ket{0_L^{(7)}} = X_L \\ket{0_L^{(7)}}. \n\\end{align}\nWe go from the logical qubit to the other by applying a logical gate $X_L$, that is, by applying a Pauli $X$ gate on each physical qubit.\n\nThe third and last one, with only five physical qubits \\cite{Laflamme_code}, is the Laflamme code \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/Laflamme]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n\\ket{0_L^{(5)}} & =  \\ket{00000} + \\ket{11000} + \\ket{01100} + \\ket{00110} \\notag\\\\\n & + \\ket{00011} + \\ket{10001} - \\ket{10100} - \\ket{01010} \\notag\\\\\n & - \\ket{00101} - \\ket{10010} - \\ket{01001} - \\ket{11110} \\notag\\\\\n & - \\ket{01111} - \\ket{10111} - \\ket{11011} - \\ket{11101},\\\\\n\\ket{1_L^{(5)}} & = X^{\\otimes 5} \\ket{0_L^{(5)}} = X_L \\ket{0_L^{(5)}}. \n\\end{align}\nThese two logical qubits constitute the smallest error-correcting code resilient to arbitrary single qubit errors \\cite{min_error_correct}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[$|0_L^{(5)}\\rangle$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_Laflamme.pdf}}\\\\%{Graphs/ErrorCorrection/laflamme_code.pdf}}\\\\\n \\vspace{-5mm}\n\t\\subfloat[$|0_L^{(7)}\\rangle$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_Steane.pdf}}\\!\\!%{Graphs/ErrorCorrection/steane_code.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[$|0_L^{(9)}\\rangle$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_Shor.pdf}}%{Graphs/ErrorCorrection/shor_code.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for generating the logical 0 state using 5, 7, and 9 physical qubits (+ ancillas, which are in a fixed state).}\n\t\\label{fig:error_correction}\n\\end{figure}\nFig.~\\ref{fig:error_correction} shows the graphs for producing each of the logical 0 states for 5, 7, and 9 physical qubits. For the Shor code, the second logical qubit state can be obtained by multiplying the weights of every bicolored edge by -1 (or alternatively, taking the 3rd, 6th, and 9th qubits and applying a minus at each red incoming edge). For the other two codes, one can obtain the graphs associated with the logical 1 state by switching the colors blue and red. Such transformation is equivalent to applying the gate $X$ on each qubit, the logical $X_L$.\\newline\n\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Products of W States}\nPrevious work with the graph representation showed how to create W states for an arbitrary even number of qubits without using any ancilla \\cite{graphs3}. On the other hand, to generate a W state with an odd number of qubits, we always needed at least one ancillary detector. Accordingly, if we want to duplicate such odd-qubit states, we can simply duplicate the graph together with the ancillas. However, this straightforward method is not the most efficient, at least for the states $\\ket{W_3}^{\\otimes2}$ and $\\ket{W_5}^{\\otimes2}$. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:w3w3}, these two states can be obtained without using ancillas \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/W3W3]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/W5W5]{experimentcounter}.\\newline\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_W3W3.pdf}\\hspace{-3mm}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/w3w3.pdf}\\hspace{-3mm}\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_W5W5.pdf}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/w5w5.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for generating the states $\\ket{W_3}^{\\otimes2}$ and $\\ket{W_5}^{\\otimes2}$ without ancillas.}\n\t\\label{fig:w3w3}\t\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Dicke States}\nThe equal superposition of every $N$-qubit state containing a single $\\ket{1}$ gives us the W states. These states can be generalized, superposing all permutations of $N$ qubits with exactly $k$ $\\ket{1}$s.

Then one can add ancillas that are connected to the $N$ first particles by bicolored edges, one for each of the $N$ particles. These new edges introduce more modes, leading to the following series of states for an even number of particles, $2k$:\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{0 ancillas, 2 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k,(k,k))}  \\\\\n    \\text{2 anc, 3 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k,(k,k\\text{ - }1,1))}  \\\\\n    \\text{2 anc, 4 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k,(k\\text{ - }1,k\\text{ - }1,1,1))}  \\\\\n    & \\cdots\n\\end{align*}\n \\vspace{-7mm}\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\text{2($k\\text{ - }1$) anc, 2$k$ modes} \\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k,(1,\\cdots,1))}\n\\end{equation*}\nFor an odd number of particles, $2k\\!+\\!1$, starting with 1 ancilla, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{1 anc, 3 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k\\!+\\!1,(k,k,1))}  \\\\\n    \\text{3 anc, 4 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k\\!+\\!1,(k,k\\text{ - }1,1,1))}  \\\\\n    \\text{3 anc, 5 modes} &\\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k\\!+\\!1,(k\\text{ - }1,k\\text{ - }1,1,1))}  \\\\\n    & \\cdots \n\\end{align*}\n \\vspace{-7mm}\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\text{$2k\\text{ - }1$ anc, $2k\\!+\\!1$ modes} \\rightarrow  \\ket{D(2k\\!+\\!1,(1,\\cdots,1))}.\n\\end{equation*}\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\\centering\n    \\subfloat[$\\ket{D(3,(1,1,1)}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_dicke33.pdf}}\\!\\!%{Graphs/Dicke/dicke33.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{D(4,(2,1,1))}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_dicke43.pdf}}%{Graphs/Dicke/dicke43.pdf}}\n \\\\\n    \\subfloat[$\\ket{D(5,(2,2,1)}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_dicke53.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[$\\ket{D(4,(1,1,1,1))}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_dicke44.pdf}}\n    \\caption{The three-dimensional Dicke states for three and four particles (top) were found by \\pytheus.

Going one step further, Yeo and Chua developed a protocol to teleport unknown states of two qubits \\cite{Yeo_2006}, and instead of using Bell states, they employed the Yeo-Chua state\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:YC}\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/YC]{experimentcounter}\\ket{YC}  =& \\ket{0000}-\\ket{0011}-\\ket{0101} \\notag\\\\ \n    &  + \\ket{0110} + \\ket{1001} + \\ket{1001} \\notag\\\\\n    & + \\ket{1100} + \\ket{1111}.\n\\end{align}\nThis highly entangled state can be produced with the graph of Fig.~\\ref{fig:yc_state}.\\newline\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\textwidth]{graph_YC.pdf}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/YCstate.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graph for generating the Yeo-Chua state.}\n\t\\label{fig:yc_state}\t\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Complex Weights as a Resource}\nExploring the applicability range of \\pytheus, we searched for four-qubit states of the form\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\psi} = c_1 \\ket{0000} + c_2 \\ket{0001} + ... + c_{16}\\ket{1111},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $c_i \\in \\{ 0,1 \\}$. A total of $2^{16}-1 = 65535$ states.\nGraphs with $\\pm1$ weights suffice to produce most of the states, many of them do not even require interference. Yet, some states, such as \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:4qubitcomplex}\n    \\ket{\\psi} &= \\ket{0011} + \\ket{0100} + \\ket{0111} + \\ket{1000} \\notag\\\\ \n    &+ \\ket{1100} + \\ket{1101} + \\ket{1110},\n\\end{align}\nrequire not only destructive interference between creation terms, but very specific ratios between the weights. In particular, the weights to produce the state \\eqref{eq:4qubitcomplex} make use of the \\textit{Golden Ratio}, since they must fulfill the expression\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:golden_ratio}\n    x^2 + x = 1.\n\\end{equation}\nThe graph that employs the golden ratio is shown in Fig~\\ref{fig:complex}, and similar graphs can produce a whole family of 64 states which are equivalent under permutations and bit-flips. However, there is an alternative complex-weighted graph, with less edges, to produce these states. As shown in Fig~\\ref{fig:complex}, the absolute value is the same for all weights and the interference patterns due to the complex phases are shown in Fig~\\ref{fig:compexPMs}.

In this section, we present graphs corresponding to quantum experiments for the creation of several highly entangled states using single-photon sources. Deterministic sources do not suffer from the same trade-off between high fidelity and high count rate as probabilistic sources. When using deterministic sources, the number of photons required can be smaller than with probabilistic sources \\cite{PhysRevA.67.030101,PhysRevA.102.012604}.\n\\paragraph{Post-Selected}\nWe have found graphs for creating different GHZ states with single-photon sources as a resource. One can create a six qubit GHZ from six input photons \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/blob/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_62_sp/graph_ghz_62_sp.pdf]{experimentcounter}, a four qutrit GHZ state from six input photons \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_62_sp]{experimentcounter}, as well as the same four qutrit GHZ state from a combination of two single photon sources and two simultaneous SPDC events \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/blob/main/pytheus/graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_43_2p2a/graph_ghz_43_2p2a.pdf]{experimentcounter} (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:heralded_sp_ghz}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n    \\centering\n \\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^2_6$ (s.p.s)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_62_sp.pdf}}\\!\\!%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_62_sp.pdf}}\\!\\!\n \\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^3_4$ (s.p.s)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_43_sp.pdf}}\\\\%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_43_sp.pdf}}\\!\\!\n \\subfloat[$\\ket{\\text{GHZ}}^3_4$ (hybrid)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_ghz_43_2p2a.pdf}}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/ghz_43_sphybird.pdf}}\n   % \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/postselected_sp_2.pdf}\n    \\caption{Graphs corresponding to the creation of three-, four- and five-particle GHZ states using single-photon sources.}\n    \\label{fig:heralded_sp_ghz}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Heralded --}\nThere have been proposals for the creation of multi-particle high-dimensional entangled states from single photon sources using discrete Fourier transform \\cite{paesani2021scheme}.

There are cross-term that occur due to the lack of photon- number resolution. We want to acknowledge that the probability of a heralding event is very low for this example (P = 0.08\\%) and it is thus unlikely that this setup is experimentally feasible. As $w$ approaches 0, fidelity approaches $100\\%$ but count-rate approaches 0. The trade-off between high fidelity and high count-rate is interesting to consider.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.26\\textwidth]{graph_heralded_bell_2d_sp_thr.pdf}\n    \\caption{Graph corresponding to the creation of a heralded two-dimensional Bell state in the outgoing photons (0-1) from four single photon sources (2-5) and two heralding detectors (6-7).

However, if one asks \\textit{how} entangled a state is, the answer is not unique, there are multiple measures of entanglement. Here we present some of these metrics, together with states that are known to maximize them. Finally, we choose a particular metric and optimize a graph, not to reach a particular state -- as done so far by maximizing the fidelity -- but to instead maximize the entanglement metric itself. In this way, we will recover some well-known entangled states and also find new ones. \n\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Schmidt Rank Vector}\nMultiparticle entangled states in high dimensions allow for a much deeper structure underlying the potential ways in which the particles can be entangled. These structures can be characterized by the Schmidt Rank Vector (SRV) and give rise to new phenomena that only exist if both the number of particles and the number of dimensions go beyond two \\cite{HuberSRV,HuberSRVentropy, CadneySRV}. Here we consider tripartite states. The rank vector is a list of the ranks of the reduced density matrices. The state $\\text{SRV(A,B,C)}$ refers to a state, where\n\\begin{equation}\n\tA=\\text{rank}(\\rho_{A}), \tB=\\text{rank}(\\rho_{B}), \tC=\\text{rank}(\\rho_{C}),\\nonumber\n\\end{equation}\nand $\\rho_{X}$ is the density matrix of the system with the particle $X$ traced out. In other words, the SRV is a vector of the dimensionalities of entanglement of every bipartition, which shows the dimensionality of entanglement between one particle and the rest of the quantum state. This master-slave-slave configuration is very useful for quantum applications such as layered quantum communication \\cite{LayeredQKD}. Taking a $\\text{SRV(3,3,2)}$ state as an example, we then know that the first two particles are both three-dimensionally entangled with the third particle, whereas the third one is only two-dimensionally entangled with the rest. The dimensionality for each particle cannot be increased with linear operations and classical communication (LOCC).\n\nSearching the $\\text{SRV(A,B,C)}$ states has been investigated with the computer algorithm \\melvin \\cite{Melvin2016} and graph theory \\cite{graphs2, hypergraphs}. Interestingly, it has been shown from graph theory that without using any ancilla particles, there are several $\\text{SRV(A,B,C)}$ states that cannot be created. \\cite{graphs2,hypergraphs}. Here we list these states (up to normalization):\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{split}\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/srv_554]{experimentcounter} &\\text{SRV(5,5,4)}:\\\\\n&\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}+\\ket{222}+\\ket{333}+\\ket{443}\\notag\\\\\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/srv_632]{experimentcounter} &\\text{SRV(6,3,2)}:\\\\\n&\\ket{000}+\\ket{101}+\\ket{210}+\\ket{311}\\notag\\\\+&\\ket{420}+\\ket{521}\\notag\\\\\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/srv_655]{experimentcounter}&\\text{SRV(6,5,5)}:\\\\\n&\\ket{000}+\\ket{111}+\\ket{222}+\\ket{334}\\notag\\\\+&\\ket{443}+\\ket{544}\\notag\\\\\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/srv_733]{experimentcounter} &\\text{SRV(7,3,3)}:\\\\\n&\\ket{000}+\\ket{101}+\\ket{210}+\\ket{311}\\notag\\\\+&\\ket{422}+\\ket{520}+\\ket{621}\\notag\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n\\begin{figure}[!b]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[SRV(5,5,4)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_srv_554.pdf}}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/srv_554.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[SRV(6,3,2)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_srv_632.pdf}}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/srv_632.pdf}}\n    \\\\ \\vspace{-2mm}\n\t\\subfloat[SRV(6,5,5)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_srv_655.pdf}}\\!\\!%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/srv_655.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\t\\subfloat[SRV(7,3,3)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_srv_733.pdf}}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/srv_733.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for producing $\\text{SRV(A,B,C)}$ states using ancillas.}\n\t\\label{fig:SRVgraphs}\t\n\\end{figure}\nIt has been unknown whether we can experimentally create these states with additional particles, and this challenging question has been open for more than three years.

By using PyTheus, one can learn how to generate much more complex SRV states of high dimensions and more particles, such as the impossible states described in \\cite{graphs2,hypergraphs}.

In particular, the hyperdeterminant of a tensor $2\\times2\\times2\\times2$ characterizes the entanglement of a 4 qubit state, which is maximal for the state (up to normalization) \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/HD]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\text{HD}} = \\ket{\\Psi^+00}+\\ket{00\\Psi^+} + \\ket{1111},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\sqrt{2}\\ket{\\Psi^+}=\\ket{01}+\\ket{10}$, and whose associated graph is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:hyperdeterminant}.\\newline\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\textwidth]{graph_HD.pdf}%{Graphs/HighlyEntangledStates/HDstate.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graph to generate the state $\\ket{\\text{HD}}$, which maximizes the hyperdeterminant.}\n\t\\label{fig:hyperdeterminant}\t\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Negative Partial Trace}\nGiven a state $\\rho_{AB}$, its \\textit{partial transpose} with respect to the subsystem $A$ is\n\\begin{equation}\n    (\\rho^{T_A})_{ab,mn} = \\rho_{mb,an}.\n\\end{equation}\nAs shown by Peres, it is a necessary condition for the separability of $A$ and $B$ that none of the eigenvalues of $\\rho^{T_A}$ are negative \\cite{peres_separability}. Moreover, it is also a sufficient condition for bipartite states of dimensions $2\\times2$ and $2\\times3$ \\cite{horodecki2001}. \n\nAiming for highly entangled states, Brown et.\\ al.\\ looked for states of 2, 3, 4, and 5 qubits, whose partial traces for each bipartition had the lowest possible eigenvalues \\cite{brown05}. They called this metric \\textit{Negative Partial Trace}, and it leads to the following states of 4 and 5 qubits \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/bssb4]{experimentcounter} \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/bssb5]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\text{BSSB4}} &= \\ket{0000} + \\ket{+011} \\notag\\\\ \n    &+ \\ket{1101} + \\ket{-110} \\\\\n     \\ket{\\text{BSSB5}} &= \\ket{000\\Phi^+} + \\ket{100\\Phi^-} \\notag\\\\\n     & + \\ket{010\\Psi^+}  + \\ket{111\\Psi^-}.\n\\end{align}\nWhere $\\sqrt{2}\\ket{\\pm}=\\ket{0}\\pm\\ket{1}$, $\\sqrt{2}\\ket{\\Phi^\\pm}=\\ket{00}\\pm\\ket{11}$, and $\\sqrt{2}\\ket{\\Psi^\\pm}=\\ket{01}\\pm\\ket{10}$.

Given a state with $\\rho_{AB}$, the R\\'enyi entropy of order $\\alpha$ between the subsystems $A$ and $B$ is\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:renyi}\n    \\mathcal{S}_\\alpha (\\rho_A) = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\log \\Tr (\\rho_A^\\alpha) = \\mathcal{S}_\\alpha(\\rho_B),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\rho_A=\\Tr_B(\\rho_{AB})$ and $\\rho_B=\\Tr_A(\\rho_{AB})$ are reduced density matrices. Similarly, the \\textit{Tsallis entropy} also describes the entanglement between $A$ and $B$\n\\begin{equation}\n \\label{eq:tsallis}\n   \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha (\\rho_A) = \\frac{1}{1-\\alpha} \\left(\\Tr (\\rho_A^\\alpha) - 1\\right) = \\mathcal{T}_\\alpha(\\rho_B).\n\\end{equation}\nNotice that in the limit $\\alpha\\rightarrow1$, both expressions approach the Von Neumann entropy.\n\nA relevant difference between both metrics is that, for $\\alpha>1$, only the Tsallis entropy is convex while the R\\'enyi one is Schur convex \\cite{renyi_concavity}.

Indeed, many of them were found numerically when maximizing such metrics. Similarly, we can use \\pytheus to maximize arbitrary physical properties of the states produced by a graph, which can be immediately translated into experiments. This is a great advantage over previous work, in which an analytically described quantum state may not be experimentally feasible.\n\nWe optimize the graph according to the Tsallis entropy for $\\alpha=2$ (see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:tsallis}) using as loss function\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:concurrence}\n    \\min_{\\omega} \\mathcal{L}(\\rho(\\omega)) = \\sum_{A}\\Tr\\rho_A^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\rho=\\ketbra{\\psi(\\omega)}$ is the state defined by a graph with weights $\\{\\omega\\}$, $\\rho_A$ is the reduced density matrix with respect to a subsystem $A$. A subsystem and its complement $A^c$ are a bipartition of the full system. The loss function is minimized for the sum of all bipartitions. \n\nGiven a bipartition, the entanglement between them is maximal if\n \\begin{equation}\n     \\rho_A = \\Tr_{A^c}(\\rho)= \\frac{1}{D}\\mathbb{I},\n \\end{equation}\nwith $D$ being the dimension of the Hilbert space in which $\\rho_A$ is defined, and $\\mathbb{I}$ the identity matrix. Accordingly, multipartite states with maximal entanglement for every bipartition are called \\textit{Absolutely Maximally Entangled} (AME); such kinds of states have applications in quantum protocols like threshold secret sharing or open-destination teleportation \\cite{AME_definitions_and_application}. On the other hand, given a state of $N$ qudits, $\\rho\\in\\mathcal{H}_d^{\\otimes N}$, we call it \\textit{k-uniform} when the entanglement is maximal for all bipartitions of $k$ qudits \\cite{k-uniform-paper}. GHZ states of N-qudits (see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:ghz}) are examples of 1-uniform states. \n\nWith \\pytheus we can pick types of bipartitions the entanglement is to be maximized. Choosing all bipartitions targets the production of an AME state, bipartitions of size $|A| = k$ target k-uniform states. A mathematical result of entanglement theory is that AMEs only exist for certain combinations of $N$ and $d$ (see table \\ref{tab: AME_overview}). In such situations we choose to optimize for k-uniform states.\n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{0.45\\textwidth}{!}{%\n\\begin{tabular}{c|ccccccccc}\n\\hline\n\\multirow{2}{*}{\\:\\textbf{Dim}\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{9}{c}{\\textbf{Number of particles}} \\\\ \\cline{2-10} \n &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:2\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:3\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:4\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:5\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:6\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:7\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:8\\:} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\:9\\:} &\n  10 \\\\ \\hline\n2 &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}(3)} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}(3)} &\n  \\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}(3) \\\\ \\hline\n3 &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}(3)} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark} \\\\ \\hline\n4 &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textbf{\u00bf?}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark} \\\\ \\hline\n5 &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{\\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}} &\n  \\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark} \\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}%\n}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Known AME states up to 10 particles and 5 dimensions.} \\textcolor{red}{\\xmark}: no AME exist for the 2-dimensional systems of 4, 7, 8, and 10 particles, nor for the 3-dimensional system of 8 particles. \\textbf{\u00bf?}: it is unknown whether there is an AME for the 4-dimensional system of 8 particles. \\textcolor{Green}{\\cmark}: there exist an AME state for the rest of systems.

We refer to them as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\text{Ent(n,d,k)}},\n\\end{equation} \nwhere $n$ stands for the number of particles, $d$ for their dimensions, and $k$ for the size of the partitions. %We can also have $k=$\\textit{all}, indicating that we maximized over all possible partitions.\n\nFor a system of four qubits, we find two interesting states when maximizing the entanglement (see Eq.~\\eqref{eq:concurrence}) for every 2-qubit partition (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:max4qubits}). We first optimize using real weights \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MaxEntanglement/k2maximal4qubitsREAL]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\text{Ent(4,2,2)}}_{\\mathbb{R}} =   \\ket{1010} + \\ket{1101} -   \\ket{0011} - \\ket{0100},\n\\end{equation}\nobtaining a state which maximizes all possible partitions except one.

These insights are important to understand the underlying resources of quantum correlations and their applicability in quantum protocols. In 1999, Asher Peres conjectured that the notion of Bell nonlocality and distillability is equivalent \\cite{peres1999all}. Bell nonlocality, as witnessed by a violation of Bell's inequality, says that no local hidden-variable model can explain the correlations observed in an experiment. A state is called distillable if a maximally entangled Bell pair can be extracted from multiple copies. The conjecture was open for 15 years until a counter-example was discovered in 2014, first for a strong version of the conjecture \\cite{moroder2014steering} and shortly after in its full form \\cite{vertesi2014disproving}. These violations are based on the uncovering of a two-particle bound state (a state that cannot be distilled) which can be used for quantum steering and violation of Bell's inequality. The Moroder-Gittsovich-Huber-G\\\"uhne-Vertesi-Brunner (MGHG-VB) state can be written as a mixed state that is an incoherent superposition of four entangled two-qutrit states,\n\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/MixedStates/peres]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\rho = \\sum_{i=1}^4 \\lambda_i \\ket{\\psi_i}\\bra{\\psi_i}\n\\end{align}\nwith $\\lambda=\\left(\\frac{3257}{6884},\\frac{450}{1721},\\frac{450}{1721},\\frac{27}{6884}\\right)$ and\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\ket{\\psi_1}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{00}+\\ket{11} \\right) \\\\\n    \\ket{\\psi_2}&=\\frac{\\sqrt{131}}{12\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{01}+\\ket{10} \\right)+\\frac{1}{60}\\ket{02}-\\frac{3}{10}\\ket{21}\\\\\n    \\ket{\\psi_3}&=\\frac{\\sqrt{131}}{12\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\ket{00}-\\ket{11} \\right)+\\frac{1}{60}\\ket{12}-\\frac{3}{10}\\ket{20}\\\\\n    \\ket{\\psi_4}&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left(-\\ket{01}+\\ket{10}+\\ket{22} \\right).\n\\end{align*}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_peres.pdf}%{Graphs/MixedStates/peres_conjecture.pdf}\n\t\\caption {Graph for the Moroder-Gittsovich-Huber-G\\\"uhne-Vertesi-Brunner (MGHG-VB) state, which is a counter-example to the Peres conjecture.

Classically, one can estimate a phase parameter more precisely by increasing the number of particles $N$ in the measurement process; the precision is typically limited to $1/\\sqrt{N}$, also known as the standard quantum limit (SQL). With the aid of quantum resources, one can beat the SQL, and the measurement precision can be enhanced to scale as $1/N$, approaching the Heisenberg limit that is governed by the physical law of quantum mechanics. One prominent representative of quantum states with the ability to break the SQL is the well-known N00N states \\cite{giovannetti2004quantum,polino2020photonic}, as described in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:NOON}. \n\nThese N00N states can not only be used to test fundamental physics via violating Bell-type inequalities \\cite{bellviolationNOON} but also play an important role in quantum-enhanced applications, quantum-enhanced microscopes and imaging systems \\cite{SupersensitivePRL,ono2013entanglement,gao2022high,ndagano2022quantum}, super-resolving phase measurements \\cite{mitchell2004super, walther2004broglie,fourNOON2006, sixNOON2007}, and quantum lithography \\cite{dowling2000}, to name a few. Interestingly, as the two-mode N00N states are formed in a superposition of two distinct states $\\ket{N,0}$ and $\\ket{0,N}$, one could consider that the two terms correspond to the ``dead cat\" and ``alive cat\" in the ``Schr\\\"{o}dinger-cat'' form \\cite{afek2010high}. With high-N00N states, we might step closer to a better understanding of macroscopic entanglement envisioned by Schr\\\"{o}dinger \\cite{schrodinger1935gegenwartige}. In the optical regime, achieving an efficient photonic source of N00N states with large $N$ is very challenging. Several schemes and experiments have been toward the direction of generating photonic high-N00N states in different ways, such as by using strong optical nonlinearities \\cite{DowlingPathEPR2007}, by linear optics and feed-forward \\cite{feedforwardNOON}, and by mixing coherent light with SPDC photon-pair sources on a standard beam splitter \\cite{PhysRevLett.100.073601,PhysRevA.76.031806,afek2010high,Afek2012}.\n\n\nAdditionally, interest has also been growing in the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters using multi-mode quantum states \\cite{zhang2018scalable,hong2021quantum}. Using a multimode N00N state, one can reach the Heisenberg limit with an $O(d)$ advantage over what is obtained with $d$ copies of a two-mode N00N state \\cite{MultiplePhase2013,multiparameter2016}. The generalization of the two-mode N00N states in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:NOON} is given as \\cite{zhang2018scalable,hong2021quantum}\n\\begin{align}\n\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{N}_{d}:=&\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}(\\ket{N,0,...,0,0}\\pm\\ket{0,N,...,0,0}\\pm...\\\\\\nonumber\n&\\pm\\ket{0,0,...,N,0}\\pm\\ket{0,0,...,0,N})_{1,...,d}.\n\\end{align}\n\nHere we show how to produce perfect N00N states without using any coherent states or feed-forward. We list some examples that might give a different conceptual understanding and new insight. For more path-entangled states, one can directly employ \\pytheus. For the ancillary detectors, we always assume they are reached by single photons, like in previous sections. \n\n\\paragraph{Two Particles --} As we have introduced in section \\ref{fock_basis}, the simplest N00N state is the $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{2}_{2}$ state that can be deterministically created via HOM interference when two indistinguishable photons are incident on a standard beam splitter simultaneously \\cite{HOM1987}. From the graph in Fig.~\\ref{fig:HOMeffect}, we can easily generalize the state to an arbitrary number of modes by adding more vertices, each one with a loop. The coherent superposition of a loop being in one of the vertices indicates the resulting multi-mode two-particle N00N states.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Three Particles --} For producing 2-mode 3-photon N00N states $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{3}_{2}$, we additionally employ an ancilla particle in the experiment. We show the graph found by \\pytheus in Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon_multimode_all}, which uses only one color, thus corresponding to the standard path-entangled N00N states. The edge can also be in different colors such that we are able to construct graphs for polarization-entangled N00N states \\cite{KimNOON2009,threeNOON2017,KimNOON2011}. We further explore the states in multi-mode cases, as described in Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon_multimode_all} (b), (c) and (d) for 3-, 4-, 5-mode three-photon N00N states. Interestingly, the graphs found by \\pytheus exhibit a nice structure, which may be amenable to generalization, to systematically produce other multi-mode NOON states without any optimization process.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[(a) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^3_2$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.246\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m3ph1anc.pdf}} \\hspace{-4mm}\n    \\subfloat[(b) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^3_3$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.246\\textwidth]{graph_noon3m3ph3anc.pdf}}\n    \\\\ \\vspace{-4mm}\n    \\subfloat[(c) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^3_4$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.246\\textwidth]{graph_noon4m3ph5anc.pdf}} \\hspace{-4mm}\n    \\subfloat[(d) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^3_5$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.246\\textwidth]{graph_noon5m3ph7anc.pdf}}\n    \\caption{Graphs for multi-mode three-particle N00N states $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^{3}_{d}$ with increasing number of ancillas.}\n    \\label{fig:noon_multimode_all}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Four Particles --} For the previous N00N states, we optimized the graphs using real weights, finding the states $\\ket{40}-\\ket{04}$ and $\\ket{400}-\\ket{040}-\\ket{004}$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/blob/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon2m4ph2anc]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon3m4ph4anc]{experimentcounter}. However, to generate the same N00N states with zero phase difference between the terms we need to, either add a $\\pi/2$ phase on the solitary loops from Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon2m4ph} or, using only real weights, add 2 more ancillas. Additionally, after generating the 4-particle N00N states for 2 and 3 modes, it became obvious how to generate the graphs for an arbitrary number of modes.\n\\begin{figure}[!h]\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[(a) $\\ket{40}-\\ket{04}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m4ph2anc.pdf}} \\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[(b) $\\ket{400}-\\ket{040}-\\ket{004}$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_noon3m4ph4anc.pdf}}\n    \\caption{Graphs with only real weights to generate 4-particle N00N states for 2 and 3 modes. Multiplying the $i$ the loops of the disconnected vertices all the amplitudes of the state's terms become positive. To increase the number of modes, we add a triangular subgraph connected to a loop. The edge connecting the two new ancillas must be negative.} %Notably, these graphs are not path connected, i.e., there is not a path that connects all vertices. Physically, that means these vertices are independent, but surprisingly, here, it leads to entanglement anyway.}\n    \\label{fig:noon2m4ph}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIt is worth noting that given a ket $\\ket{40}$, each combination of non-repeating edges contributes twice as much as one with duplicate edges (assuming equal weights). This is a consequence of the multinomial theorem applied to the creation operators described in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:pairsource}. \n\n\\paragraph{Other Two-Mode States --} For the previous N00N states, the associated graphs have shown some patterns. The more obvious was the increasing need for ancillas, whether we were adding more photons or modes. Moreover, based on a few graphs, we realized how to generate N00N states with 2 and 4 photons for an arbitrary number of modes. In Fig.~\\ref{fig:2mode_noons} we show how to produce the two-mode N00N state for 5, 6, 7, and 8 photons \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon2m5ph3anc]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon2m6ph4anc]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon2m7ph5anc]{experimentcounter}\\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/noon2m8ph6anc]{experimentcounter}. As with the 3-photon N00N states, it seems to be an underlying pattern in the graphs solutions when increasing the number of photons.\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[(a) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^5_2$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.23\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m5ph3anc.pdf}} \\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[(b) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^6_2$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m6ph4anc.pdf}}\n    \\\\ \\vspace{-4mm}\n    \\subfloat[(c) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^7_2$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.235\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m7ph5anc.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[(d) $\\ket{\\text{N00N}}^8_2$]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_noon2m8ph6anc.pdf}}\n    \\caption{Graphs for two-mode N00N states of 5, 6, 7, and 8 photons.}\n    \\label{fig:2mode_noons}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Platonic Solid States}\\label{sec:platonic_state}\nWe have been considering states where all $N$ photons are in the same path, with the other paths empty. However, \\pytheus can produce path-entangled states which do not fulfill such restrictions. Among them, a very special case leads to the highly symmetric Platonic Solid State \\cite{bjork2015stars,extremalPolarization2015,Bouchard2017}, which can resolve rotations around any axis equally well. In the Platonic picture, shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:solid_states}, an $N$-photon state is mapped onto $N$ points on the Poincar\\'e sphere \\cite{majorana1932atomi}, offering a systematic way for visualization. This also relates to a long-lasting problem of distributing $N$ points on the Poincar\\'e sphere in a highly symmetric fashion, where one can have many different solutions based on the function one tries to optimize \\cite{conway1996packing,saff1997distributing}. Additionally, the concept of Platonic solids has also been used for fundamental investigations in quantum physics \\cite{Tavakoli2020platonicsolids,Pal2022platonicbell}. Apart from their symmetric elegance, there is plenty of room for applications of these states, for instance, in magnetometry, polarimetry, and metrology. Researchers have started investigating how to generate these Platonic solid state. In this part, we show the examples found by \\pytheus.\n\n\n \n\n\\paragraph{Tetrahedron --} Our first Platonic solid state is the tetrahedron \\cite{Grasslwebsite}, which is the unique optimal four-photon state for characterizing polarization rotations. The state written in the Fock basis reads as \n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\Psi^{(1)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}(\\ket{4,0} + \\sqrt{2}\\ket{1,3}).\n\\end{equation}\nIt can be produced by the graph in Fig.~\\ref{fig:solid_states} (top panels), and has already been implemented \\cite{Hugothesis2022}. \n\nThe similarity between the graphs that produce the tetrahedron and the three-photon N00N state discovered by \\pytheus (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon_multimode_all} a) shows a nice pattern: to generate states in the Fock basis, we can add an arbitrary number of photons to any path. In this way, starting with a general state $\\ket{\\text{M,N}} \\pm \\ket{\\text{N,M}}$, we can obtain %The graph is very similar to the one from Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon_multimode_all}a, which produced the state $\\ket{03} + \\ket{30}$ with one ancilla. Here the weights are different (as are the contributions to each ket), but the topology is essentially the same, we only add an extra edge which connects to an additional ancilla connected with only one edge. These addition can be used in any graph that produces $\\ket{N,0} + \\ket{0,N}$, obtaining a new graph that $\\ket{N+x,0} + \\ket{x,N}$. We just need to add $x$ ancilla vertices, each connected with a single edge to the same mode. Moreover, we can simultaneously add $y$ vertices  of degree one, which connect with the other mode, which brings us \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:photon_addition}\n   \\ket{\\text{M,N}} \\pm \\ket{\\text{N,M}} \\Rightarrow \\ket{\\text{M+x,N+y}} \\pm \\ket{\\text{N+x,M+y}}.\n\\end{equation}\nWe only need to connect the first and second paths to $x$ and $y$ ancillary photons, respectively. This construction can be used for an arbitrary number of modes.\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n    \\centering\n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.21\\textwidth]{Tetrahedrons.pdf}} \\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_tetrahedron.pdf}}\\vspace{-1cm}\n    \\\\\n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.21\\textwidth]{Octahedrons.pdf}} \\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_octahedron.pdf}}\\vspace{-1cm}\n    \\\\ \n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.21\\textwidth]{Cubes.pdf}}  \\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[]{\\includegraphics[width=0.25\\textwidth]{graph_cube.pdf}}\n    \n    \\caption{Graphs for producing tetrahedron, octahedron, and cube quantum states.}\n    \\label{fig:solid_states}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Octahedron --}\nThe octahedron state reads\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\Psi^{(2)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{5,1} - \\ket{1,5}),\n\\end{equation}\nand was found by \\pytheus using only 4 ancillary detectors (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:solid_states}). Alternatively, we can apply the pattern described in Eq.~\\eqref{eq:photon_addition} to the graph that produces $\\ket{40} - \\ket{04}$, which is shown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:noon2m4ph} a).\n\n\\paragraph{Cube --}\nThe last platonic solid we are able to produce is the cube state, which reads \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/FockStates/cube]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\ket{\\Psi^{(3)}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}(\\sqrt{10}\\ket{8,0} + 2\\sqrt{7}\\ket{4,4} + \\sqrt{10}\\ket{0,8}).\n\\end{equation}\nIn Fig.~\\ref{fig:solid_states}, we show the graph that can be used to generate the cube state. As we can see from the expression and Fig.~\\ref{fig:solid_states} (bottom), the graph cannot be obtained by modifying one of the previous graphs for a two-mode N00N state.\n\n\n\\subsection{Towards Quantum Simulation}\\label{sec:qsim}\nIn this section, we present quantum state generation for states from condensed matter physics which could be interesting for quantum simulation\\cite{aspuru2012photonic}. The quantum entangled states of few- or many-body systems can generally be expressed by the tensor network formulations~\\cite{Schollwock2011, Cirac2021}. One of the most successful members of this family with a vast application in condensed matter physics is the 1D matrix product state~(MPS). Here one represents the quantum state of a system with periodic boundary conditions and $N$ particles as\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\psi} = \\sum_{s} \\tr\\left[ A_{1}^{(s_{1})} A_{2}^{(s_{2})} \\ldots A_{N}^{(s_{N})}  \\right] \\ket{s_{1}\\ldots s_{N}},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $s_{i}=\\{0,\\ldots d-1\\}$ denotes the local state of the $i$th particle with local physical dimension $d$. Here $A_{i}^{(s_{i})}$ is a complex matrix with dimension $\\chi$, also known as the bond~(virtual) dimension. The matrix $A_{i}^{(s_{i})}$ can be viewed as a projector from a $\\chi$-dimensional virtual~(correlation) vector space into the physical $d$-dimensional space~\\cite{MiguelRamiro2020}. While in non-interacting systems, described by product states, the bond dimension $\\chi$ is one, this quantity grows exponentially with $N$ in most strongly correlated systems. This results in employing numerical techniques to (approximately) obtain the ground states of most many-body systems. Nevertheless, one can find multiple few- or many-body ground states with $\\chi>1$ but independent of the particle number. \nHere, we present a collection of these ground states with a concise description of their host Hamiltonian and their physical implication upon realization.\nWhile our focus is on zero-temperature ground states, we emphasize that the applicability of \\pytheus is not limited to these states. This is because both mixed states~\\ref{sec:mixed}, which describe open quantum states, and states constitute combinations of (various) Fock states~\\ref{fock_basis}, can be used to study the (grand) canonical ensemble, are treatable by \\pytheus.\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Spin-1/2 Systems}\nDue to the simplicity of spin-1/2 systems and the surge of interest in qubit quantum computation, these many-body systems received ever-growing attention.\nThe local physical space of these systems spanned by $\\{ \\ket{\\uparrow}, \\ket{\\downarrow} \\}$, or equivalently $\\{ \\ket{0}, \\ket{1} \\}$, results in the local physical dimension $d=2$. Despite such a small physical dimension, the obtained ground states can be rich and exotic. In the following, we list some of these states.    \n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Spin-1/2 Wire --}\nA computational quantum spin-1/2 wire governed by nearest-neighbor interactions, associated with non-zero two-point correlation functions and arbitrary local entanglement, is described by~\\cite{Gross2010, MiguelRamiro2020}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\psi} =\\sum_{s_i =0}^{1}\n    \\tr[ A (s_{n-1}) \\ldots A(s_1) ] \\ket{s_1 \\ldots s_n},\n\\end{align}\nwhere \n\\begin{align}\n    A(\\uparrow) &=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} G,\\quad G= \\exp (\\i \\pi \\sigma^{x}/\\tau) ,\\\\\n    A(\\downarrow) &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} G T (\\phi), \\quad T=\n    \\begin{pmatrix}\n        e^{-\\i \\phi/2} & 0 \\\\\n        0 & e^{\\i \\phi /2}\n    \\end{pmatrix},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\phi$ and $\\tau$ denote the entanglement factor and period, respectively.\n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:spinhalf_wire} displays the associated graph for the ground state of the spin-1/2 wire for four particles with $\\phi= \\pi/2$.

The well-known examples of these scar states are shown to be present in the AKLT spin chain models~\\cite{Moudgalya2018, Moudgalya2018b}. The experimental realizations of such states are also reported in Rydberg-atom quantum simulators~\\cite{Bernien2017, Choi2019}.

Machine learning has been previously employed for the artificial discovery of quantum communication schemes \\cite{wallnofer2020machine}.\n\n\n\nThe first experimental realization of entanglement swapping was presented as a way of entangling two photons that never interacted \\cite{pan1998experimental}. In this section we show graphs corresponding to experiments that create entanglement between two parties  (each party with single or multiple photons) without interaction between the parties. Entanglement swapping has a strong connection to other quantum communication tasks, e.g.\\ teleportation. This opens the door to use \\pytheus for discovering related quantum information protocols.\n\n\\paragraph{Entangling Two Photons that Never Interacted without Bell Pairs --}\nRespecting the constraints that are placed on two particles that do not interact (presented in section \\ref{sec:qcommunication}) we show a graph that entangles two photons from independent sources in Fig.~\\ref{fig:entswap} . The corresponding setup constructed by path identity does not require the initial creation of entangled Bell pairs \\numbering{experimentcounter}. \n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{entswap.png}\n\\caption {Entanglement between two qubits without a common source. Because the vertices a and d have no connection in the graph, each of the corresponding photons is created in one of two disjoint subsystems (green boxes).}\n\\label{fig:entswap}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\\paragraph{Multiparticle Entanglement Swapping --}\nPerforming simultaneous entanglement swapping on multiple pairs of particles is one of the key players in achieving resource-efficient quantum communication. Entanglement swapping between two qubits requires two additional particles for a Bell state measurement. Performing this swapping experiment in parallel for $n$ qubit pairs would require $2n$ additional photons. We prompted \\pytheus to find experiments that beat this naive baseline. With this, we found a three-qubit entanglement swapping experiment (Fig.~\\ref{fig:mmultiswap}), which produces the state \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Communication/3pES]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\Phi^+}_{03}\\otimes\\ket{\\Phi^+}_{14}\\otimes\\ket{\\Phi^+}_{25},\n\\end{align}\nwhere the photons $0,1,2$ are separated from $3,4,5$. This experiment requires four additional particles instead of the six particles necessary for the parallel case described above.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\subfloat[Three qubit ES]{\\includegraphics[width=0.22\\textwidth]{graph_3pES_boosted.pdf}}\\!\\!\n\\subfloat[Outline of Experiment]{\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\textwidth]{alicebob.png}}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Entanglement swapping of 3 Bell pairs measuring only 4 photons.}  Left: abstract graph for multi-particle entanglement swapping.

When Charlie measures a coincidence in all four detectors Alice and Bob share three Bell pairs (0\\&3, 1\\&4, 2\\&5) without them having interacted. This is possible due to a superposition of events where Charlie either receives three photons from Alice and one photon from Bob or one photon from Alice and three photons from Bob.}\n\\label{fig:mmultiswap}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSimilarly, entanglement swapping between a pair of qutrits requires four ancillary particles. We found that \"performing entanglement swapping for two pairs of qutrits could also beat the naive baseline by only requiring six ancillas instead of eight, in total, to produce \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Communication/2pES_3d]{experimentcounter}\n\\begin{align}\n    \\ket{\\Phi^+}^{3d}_{02}\\otimes\\ket{\\Phi^+}^{3d}_{13},\n\\end{align}\nwhere the photons $0,1$ are separated from $2,3$, and $\\ket{\\Phi^+}^{3d}$ is the first three-dimensional Bell state.\n\n\\paragraph{Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources}\nIt is also possible to use single-photon sources for entanglement swapping \\cite{basset2019entanglement,troiani2014entanglement,zopf2019entanglement}.

Here we present a wider range of measurements that \\pytheus has discovered. Many others, such as POVM (positive operator-valued measure) or their symmetric, informationally complete special case (SIC-POVMs) could be additional targets for future research, given their exceptional importance for quantum information tasks \\cite{bergou2010discrimination,bent2015experimental} as well as their connection to exciting number theoretical questions \\cite{caves2002unknown}.\n\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Analyzers}\nHere, we use the word \\textit{analyzer} to refer to experimental setups that confirm a collection of photons to be in a particular state.

Later referred to as the Mean King's Problem (MKP), it involves two parties. Alice, who sends a quantum state which she created to another party -- the Mean King. The Mean King then performs a projective measurement on the state in a basis of his choice out of a collection of mutually unbiased bases (MUBs). Alice is then allowed to perform one more measurement, after which the King declares his measurement basis and Alice must correctly guess his result. Should Alice guess incorrectly even once, she will suffer a cruel fate, for the Mean King is exceptionally intolerant of poor guesses. This task has applications in  quantum key distribution, wherein even the slightest discrepancy between the shared secret key of Alice and Bob implicates (in principle) the presence of an eavesdropper.  \n\nOver the years, various generalizations to the initial solution, proposed in the original paper \\cite{vaidman1987}, have been introduced. Here, we employ a generalization proposed by Hayashi, Horibe, and Hashimoto \\cite{hayashi2005} for quantum states of dimension $D$ which is a prime power. This solution proposes that Alice first prepares a maximally entangled, two-photon state $\\ket{\\psi_o}$ and sends one of her photons to the Mean King.  After the King makes a projective measurement in one of the $(D+1)$ MUBs, Alice retrieves her photon and performs a measurement in the basis of states credited to Vaidman, Akaronov, and Albert (VAA states). There are $D^2$ VAA states in all. For $D=2$, the first VAA state can be written as \n \\begin{align}\n        \\ket{\\phi_1} &= \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2}\\ket{00} + e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{01} + e^{i\\frac{\\pi} {4}}\\ket{10})\n        %\\ket{\\phi_2} &= \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2}\\ket{00} + e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{01} - e^{i\\frac{\\pi} {4}}\\ket{10}), \\\\\n       % \\ket{\\phi_3} &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2} \\ket{11} + e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{01} + e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{10}), \\\\\n       % \\ket{\\phi_4} &= \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2} \\ket{11} - e^{i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{01} + e^{-i\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\\ket{10}).\n\\end{align}\nFor $D=3$, the third VAA state can be written as \n \\begin{align}\n        %\\ket{\\phi_1} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{00} + \\ket{01} + \\ket{10}), \\\\\n        %\\ket{\\phi_2} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{00} + \\alpha(\\ket{01} + \\ket{10} + \\ket{12} + \\ket{21})\\\\ \\nonumber\n        %&+ \\beta\\ket{20} + \\gamma\\ket{02}), \\\\\n        \\ket{\\phi_3} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{00} + \\alpha(\\ket{02} + \\ket{10} + \\ket{01} + \\ket{20}) \\\\ \\nonumber\n        &+ \\beta(\\ket{12}) + \\gamma(\\ket{21})) \n        %\\ket{\\phi_4} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{11} + \\beta(\\ket{12} + \\ket{20}) + \\gamma(\\ket{02} + \\ket{21}) \\\\ \\nonumber\n        %&+ \\epsilon(\\ket{01}) + \\nu(\\ket{10})),\n        %\\end{align}\n        %\\begin{align}\n        %\\ket{\\phi_5} &=  \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{11} + \\omega\\ket{02} + \\omega^{*}\\ket{20}),\\\\\n        %\\ket{\\phi_6} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{11} + \\alpha(\\ket{12} + \\ket{21}) + \\nu(\\ket{01} + \\ket{20})\\\\ \\nonumber\n        %&+ \\epsilon(\\ket{02} + \\ket{10})), \\\\\n       % \\ket{\\phi_7} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{22} + \\beta(\\ket{01} + \\ket{10}) + \\gamma(\\ket{12} + \\ket{21})\\\\ \\nonumber \n        %&+ \\epsilon\\ket{20} + \\nu\\ket{02}), \\\\\n      %  \\ket{\\phi_8} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{22} + \\alpha(\\ket{01} + \\ket{10}) + \\epsilon(\\ket{12} + \\ket{21})\\\\ \\nonumber &+ \\nu(\\ket{20} + \\ket{02})), \\\\\n       %\\ket{\\phi_9} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} (\\ket{12} + \\omega\\ket{21} + \\omega^{*}\\ket{22}),\n      \\end{align}\nwhere $\\omega=e^{-i 2\\pi/3}$, $\\alpha=(\\omega^2 + 2\\omega)/3$, $\\beta=(\\omega^2 + 2)/3$, and $\\gamma=(\\omega + 2)/3$, \n\n%$\\epsilon=(1 + 2\\omega)/3$, and $\\nu=(2\\omega^2 +1)/3$.\n%\\begin{align}\n%\\omega &= e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} & \\nonumber\n%\\alpha &= \\frac{\\omega^2 + 2\\omega}{3}\\\\ \\nonumber\n%\\beta &= \\frac{\\omega^2 + 2}{3} &\n%\\gamma &= \\frac{\\omega + 2}{3} \\\\ \\nonumber\n%\\epsilon &= \\frac{1 + 2\\omega}{3} &\n%\\nu &= \\frac{2\\omega^2 +1}{3} \\nonumber\n%\\end{align}\n%\\begin{equation}\n%    \\ket{\\phi_k} =  -\\ket{\\psi_{o}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{D}}\\sum_{m=0}^{D}   \\ket{m_{f_{k}(m)}\\bar{m_{f_{k}(m)}}}.\n%\\end{equation}\n%Where $m=0,1...D$ denotes the $m^{th}$ basis, $k=0,1...D^2$, $f_{k}(m)$ is a function that maps to an eigenstate of basis m.

Note that addition and multiplication are defined according to the rules of the finite field $F(D)$.\n\n\nExperimentally realizing Alice's measurement in this basis is non-trivial. Setups that recreate the two-dimensional VAA measurement using two qubits encoded in a single photon  \\cite{oliver2003,Englert2001} and that realize extensions to the Mean King's problem \\cite{chengQiuHu2020} have been proposed; but the original solution to the Mean King's Problem involves two photons, to which no experimental realization has been proposed for any prime-power $D$. Here we provide examples discovered by \\pytheus for select prime-dimensional cases.  \n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[MKP (2d)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_MKP_2d.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[MKP (3d)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_MKP_3d.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs realizing the VAA state measurement for the MKP in the 2-dimensional case and 3-dimensional case.}\n\t\\label{fig:mkp}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Two-dimensional Case --} The left side of Fig.~\\ref{fig:mkp} shows the graph of Alice's measurement in the VAA basis \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Measurements/MKP_2d]{experimentcounter}. This graph was found with \\pytheus by optimizing for the VAA state projection into $\\ket{\\phi_{1}}$. Surprisingly however, during the translation of the graph to an optical setup, we found that several other VAA states can be projected with the same setup, by adding detectors at unused beam splitter ports. Several of the remaining VAA states can then be distinguished by the set of possible simultaneous two-detector click events that they each trigger. Since any result of the Mean King's measurement can be expressed in terms of a superposition of VAA states, Alice is able to guess the result by performing the measurement of her input state in the VAA basis and guessing the state that can be expressed in terms of Alice's measurement result. This procedure works regardless of the Mean King's choice of MUB in his measurement.   %The possible two-detector click events upon sending each VAA state to this basis are as follows. \n%\\begin{align*}\n%    \\ket{\\phi_0}  & \\rightarrow & c_0d_0, c_0e_0, c_0f_0, c_0g_0, d_0f_0,d_0g_0, e_0f_0, e_0g_0, f_0g_0 ,\\\\\n%    \\ket{\\phi_1} & \\rightarrow & c_0d_0, c_0e_0, c_0f_0, c_0g_0, d_0f_0, d_0g_0, e_0f_0, e_0g_0, f_0g_0 , \\\\\n%    \\ket{\\phi_2} & \\rightarrow & c_0d_0, c_0e_0, e_0f_0, d_0f_0, d_0g_0, e_0f_0, e_0g_0  ,\\\\\n%     \\ket{\\phi_3} & \\rightarrow & c_0d_0, c_0e_0, c_0f_0, d_0f_0, e_0f_0, e_0g_0,f_0g_0,\n%\\end{align*}\n%Where we note that the two-detector event $c_0g_0$ does not occur when we send $\\ket{\\phi_2}$ or $\\ket{\\phi_3}$.\n\n%Alice can then retrodict the King's measurement on her maximally entangled state $\\ket{\\psi_0}$ using the following protocol: If the King's measuring basis corresponds to m=0, Alice concludes that the king has measured $\\ket{11}=\\ket{\\phi_2} + \\ket{\\phi_3}$ if the detectors $c$ and $g$ do not trigger simultaneously. Otherwise, she must conclude that the king has measured $\\ket{00} = \\ket{\\phi_0} + \\ket{\\phi_1}$.  If the king chooses $m=1$ as his measurement basis, Alice concludes that the King has measured $\\ket{1_{1}\\bar{1_{1}}} = \\ket{\\phi_1} + \\ket{\\phi_2}$ provided that the detector $g$ triggers simultaneously with $d$ but never with $c$. If it is detector $f$ that triggers instead of $d$, then Alice instead concludes that $\\ket{1_{0}\\bar{1_0}} = \\ket{\\phi_0} + \\ket{\\phi_3}$ was measured (Alice would need to throw away events indicating that $\\ket{\\phi_0}$ or $\\ket{\\phi_1}$ was measured. In the case of $m=2$, Alice can follow a similar procedure to conclude that the King has measured $\\ket{2_0\\bar{2_0}} =  \\ket{\\phi_0} + \\ket{\\phi_2}$ or $\\ket{2_1\\bar{2_1}} =  \\ket{\\phi_1} + \\ket{\\phi_3}$.%\n\n\\paragraph{Three-Dimensional Case --}\nThe right-hand side of Fig. ~\\ref{fig:mkp} shows the graph for the projection of the state into the one of the three-dimensional VAA states $\\ket{\\phi_{3}}$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Measurements/MKP_3d]{experimentcounter}. As with the two-dimensional case, we add again detectors at the empty port of beam splitters and find that we can distinguish between more three of the nine states without any additional modifications. After post-selection, Alice has a guaranteed chance to correctly guess the Mean King's measurement result so long as the King does not choose the second MUB for his measurement. Were the King to pick that MUB, two of the three results of the measurement are expressed in terms of VAA states that Alice cannot distinguish, giving her a 50\\% chance of escaping the Mean King's cruelty. \n\n\n%With this in mind, Alice is able to retrodict the result of the King's measurement using a similar procedure to the above if the King chooses $m=1,3$ or $4$ as his measuring basis. If $m=2$, Alice would be able to resolve $\\ket{2_0\\bar{2_0}}$ of the basis by measuring $\\ket{\\phi_1}$, $\\ket{\\phi_5}$, or $\\ket{\\phi_9}$; but, since the remaining eigenstates of the basis are both superpositions of the indistinguishable VAA states, Alice would guess incorrectly with 50\\% probability. \n%It may be possible to improve upon the distinguishability of the VAA states by modifying the phases being applied within the experiment.  \n\n\n\\subsection{Quantum Gates}\\label{experiments:gates}\nUniversal quantum gates, which rely on the interaction between two or more photons, can be realized with non-linearities induced by measurements \\cite{knill2001scheme}. Quantum gates based on this approach, such as a CNOT between two qubits, have been realized experimentally for almost twenty years \\cite{gasparoni2004realization}. However, since then, the attempt to experimentally discover a wide range of quantum gates has continued due to the advancement of experimental resources which can deal with higher dimensional systems. \n\n\\paragraph{Heralded --}\nWe call a quantum gate heralded when only ancillary particles are detected, meaning that the outgoing particles are not measured. The photons exiting such a gate can continue into further components of a longer circuit. At the end of the circuit it is necessary to confirm that two photons have exited the gate, but not which path they followed.\nWe find that a higher dimensional version of the CNOT gate with a control qubit and a target qutrit ($\\text{CNOT}(2,3)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot23]{experimentcounter}) can also be realized with two ancilla photons.\nFurther, we find a heralded Toffoli gate with four ancillas \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/toffoli]{experimentcounter}; see Fig.~\\ref{fig:heraldedgates}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n    \\subfloat[Heralded CNOT(2,3)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot23.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[Heralded Toffoli]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_toffoli.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for heralded quantum gates.}\n\t\\label{fig:heraldedgates}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%    \\item Toffoli (4 ancilla)\n%    \\item CNOT(2,3)\n\n\\paragraph{Reduced Input Space --}\nFor some tasks in which quantum gates are applied, there is some prior knowledge about the input state. This knowledge can be exploited to reduce the experimental resources required to perform the transformation \\cite{q_mem_advantage,NonDetLogicOperations}. A wide range of constraints on the input state can be encoded by our framework. Here we show examples of heralded quantum gates where a target qubit is prepared in the zero state before entering the gate. \n\n\\pytheus found gates $\\text{CNOT}(3,3)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot33_0]{experimentcounter}, $\\text{CNOT}(4,4)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/blob/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot44_0]{experimentcounter} and the Fredkin gate \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/fredkin_0]{experimentcounter} acting on a target input photon in the computational zero state; see Fig.~\\ref{fig:onzero}. A post-selected Fredkin gate on the full input space has been experimentally realized \\cite{fredkin16}.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[heralded CNOT(3,3)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot33_0.pdf}}\n\t\\subfloat[heralded Fredkin]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_fredkin_0.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[heralded CNOT(4,4)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot44_0.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for heralded quantum gates with reduced input space.}\n\t\\label{fig:onzero}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\paragraph{Post-Selected --}\nWhen post-selecting a gate, all outgoing photons are detected and thus destroyed. Such a gate does not require as many resources as a heralded gate, but it imposes restrictions, such as not mixing the two output paths, on the remainder of the circuit, to ensure that the presence of a photon in each output of the gate can be ascertained.\n    \\pytheus found different post-selected high-dimensional CNOT gates, such as $\\text{CNOT}(2,3)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/blob/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot23_post]{experimentcounter}, $\\text{CNOT}(2,4)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot24_post]{experimentcounter}, $\\text{CNOT}(3,3)$ \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/cnot33_post]{experimentcounter} and the Toffoli gate on a qutrit \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/Gates/toffoli_3d_post]{experimentcounter}; see Fig.~\\ref{fig:postselectedgates}.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[CNOT(2,3)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot23_post.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[CNOT(2,4)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot24_post.pdf}}\\\\\n    \\subfloat[CNOT(3,3)]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_cnot33_post.pdf}}\\!\\!\n    \\subfloat[3d Toffoli with two ancilla photons]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_toffoli_3d_post.pdf}} \n\t\\caption {Graphs for quantum gates with post-selection.}\n\t\\label{fig:postselectedgates}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Single Photon Sources for Quantum Gates}\n    Experiments exploiting single-photon sources as an additional resource for the construction of quantum gates have been previously demonstrated \\cite{spscnot}.

This ability might be useful for finding experimental configurations with particular symmetries or properties that are interesting, independent of the resulting quantum state. Such metrics can also be combined with other objectives mentioned in the previous sections.\n\\tocless\\subsubsection{Assembly Index}\nAs an example for structural property discovery, we consider the \\textit{assembly index}, which has been invented in chemistry for the search of extraterrestrial life \\cite{marshall2017probabilistic, marshall2021identifying}. Specifically, the assembly index counts the complexity of building up a combinatorial structure, for instance, molecules or --- in our case --- graphs. It counts the number of independent processes that are necessary to create a structure. The hypothesis is that a structure with a large assembly index cannot be formed by natural processes and would require complex (living) systems for its generation. Strong indications in favor of this hypothesis have been found in the study of millions of molecules on earth \\cite{marshall2021identifying}.\n\nOur goal here is to discover graphs with very high assembly indices. The assembly index is a discrete structural metric that cannot be optimized directly using gradients. However, we can use the weights of edges to transform the discrete metric into a continuously differentiable metric. A general procedure is to compute the average combinatorial value of the weighted graph from sampled discrete graphs. Here, the weights $|\\omega_i|^2$ are used as the probability for sampling discrete graphs. While this procedure is differential, it is computationally expensive as many sampled graphs need to be evaluated to obtain an average assembly index of the whole graph.\n\nAlternatively, here we restrict ourselves to graphs with exactly eight edges (with 4 \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/AssemblyIndex/assembly4]{experimentcounter} and 6 \\numbering[https://github.com/artificial-scientist-lab/PyTheus/tree/main/pytheus/graphs/AssemblyIndex/assembly6]{experimentcounter} vertices). Here, the eight highest-weighted edges are used to generate the graph, and in addition, weights are used to change the order of edges. The graphs in Fig.~\\ref{fig:assemblyindex} present graphs with very high assembly indices with 4 vertices and 8 edges as well as 6 vertices and 10 edges.\n\n \n\n\\begin{figure}\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[4 qubits, 8 edges,\\\\assembly index 8\\centering]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_assembly4.pdf}}\\hspace*{\\fill}\n\t\\subfloat[6 qubits, 10 edges,\\\\assembly index 10\\centering]{\\includegraphics[width=0.24\\textwidth]{graph_assembly6.pdf}}\n\t\\caption {Graphs for assembly index.}\n\t\\label{fig:assemblyindex}\n\\end{figure}\n\n%A deterministic loss function to maximize the assembly index is the \\textit{top-n-assembly} function.

The second sum serves to \\textit{demote} edges that are part of the top $n$ edges but could be switched with $e_{n+1}$ to increase the AI.\n\n\n\\section{Outlook}\\label{sec:outlook}\nThis article uses a list of examples to showcase the broad range of possibilities of digital discovery in quantum optics. The goal to design one hundred novel and intriguing experiments has led us to collect a diverse set of tasks for which experimental setups could be designed. To make the discoveries possible, we expanded the theoretical framework underlying the algorithm and produced faster, more versatile open-source software. We hope that this work can be an inspiration for experimental physicists in two ways: (1) to explore some of the experiments as they are proposed in this article (2) to see that \\pytheus can be used to design experiments for a wide range of targets and for individually tailored specifications of experimental restrictions and resources. To explore particular examples that have not been covered in this article, the open-source library \\pytheus can be used. Many more avenues leave room for significant further exploration, particularly within the optimization for targets other than fidelity, as well as more specific experimental constraints. For this, the \\pytheus framework can readily be expanded in the future.\n\nA number of extensions that would be interesting include the discovery of experiments that maximize success probability in terms of heralding efficiency or Bell state measurement efficiency, especially as experimentally available technologies became increasingly powerful \\cite{bayerbach2022bell}. The potential of \\pytheus on suggesting experimental setups can pave the way to find experiments to simulate quantum states, which are nowadays merely realizable in extreme (thermodynamics) conditions, such as high pressure and low temperature~\\cite{Blume2012}. An exciting extension would be the analysation whether we can extend state generation to encoding the dymanics of a quantum state into the weights of the graphs. Along with this line of research, it is theoretically tantalizing to explore the putative correlation between the complexity of time-evolved states~\\cite{Parker2019} and the complexity of associated graphs as outputs of \\pytheus.%This would allow for the experimental investigation of nonequilibrium quantum systems, combined with the ability of \\pytheus to characterize different phases of a system, shown in Sec.~\\ref{sec:qsim}, may also allow one to exploit excited-state physics~\\cite{Lloyd-Hughes2021}, usually with an ultrashort lifetime in quantum systems, in advancing state-of-the-art quantum technologies. \n\nAs a final thought, we want to view our results through an additional lens. We have created a dataset of 100 hand-selected quantum experiments that are some aspects exceptional (which \\pytheus has discovered). This dataset might be large enough for highly efficient artificial intelligence algorithms to bootstrap an intuition of what properties make an experiment interesting, and allow them to produce proposals for new, hopefully equally interesting quantum experiments. It would sure be exciting to investigate the physical properties of the proposals that the machine believes are \\textit{interesting}. In the best case, it could act as an inspiration for new ideas for the human scientist \\cite{krenn2022scientific, rudolph2023terry}.\n\n\\tocless\\section{Acknowledgment}\nThe authors thank Jian-Wei Wang and Jake Bulmer for their useful comments.

Carefully consider if the physics of the proposed experiment is sound and if the experimental setup is feasible.\n\nYou have two possible actions 'accept' and 'reject'\n\nDo not accept suggestions that propose a state generation as a target.\n\nYou can only respond with a single complete\n\"Thought, Action, Action Input\".\n\nComplete format (don't use additional formatting such as bold text):\n\nThought: (explain your understanding of the proposed experiment and your reasoning on its feasibility and novelty.)\nAction: (the action name, should be 'reject')\nAction Input: (Provide your final feedback as a self-contained two to three sentence response (not referencing your previous statements).

    "output": "Thought: The proposal to perform a four\u2010node cycle Bell test by interconnecting four SPDC sources and static, wavefront\u2010shaped 4\u00d74 Bell analyzers at two nodes falls squarely into PyTheus\u2019s strength of designing measurement-based quantum protocols. Implementing multiport analyzers via nanophotonic resonator arrays is challenging but feasible with contemporary wavefront-shaping techniques, and the cycle-inequality target can be encoded directly in PyTheus as a measurement optimization.  \nAction: accept  \nAction Input: This is a well\u2010posed measurement protocol for demonstrating nonlocality on a square network without feedback loops, and the use of static wavefront-shaped nanophotonic Bell analyzers is both innovative and experimentally feasible. PyTheus can be used to optimize the required analyzer graphs and entangled\u2010pair source configurations to realize the \u201cBell_test_stat\u201d cycle inequality."
