Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “polaritonic state” and “corner mode” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network target:
    1. Remote gate teleportation: perform a heralded CNOT between two abstract qubits labeled “corner mode” (control) and “polaritonic state” (target) using entanglement swapping and Bell‐pair mediators, forbidding any direct source between them.
    2. Multi-hop teleportation chain: teleport an arbitrary qubit from a corner‐mode node through an intermediate polariton node to a second corner mode, optimizing ancilla resources by combining two Bell‐measurements into one multipartite measurement.
    3. Entanglement routing star: use a single linear‐optical network to distribute entanglement on demand between any chosen pair among four nodes labelled corner and polariton, by measuring a fixed set of ancillas (no feedback), thus demonstrating passive programmable entanglement routing.

  Step 2: Novelty & obstacles:
    1. Remote CNOT: novel because prior examples only show localized heralded gates. Main obstacle: specifying a gate rather than state, but Pytheus already supports heralded‐gate targets.
    2. Chained teleportation: similar to swapping examples but adds compression of two swaps into one network. Obstacle: gating of transformation rather than purely state generation.
    3. Routing star: very speculative—mapping dynamic routing w/o feedback may not be realizable in passive linear optics.

  Step 3: Pick the heralded remote CNOT between corner and polariton qubits. It cleanly illustrates a nontrivial network transformation, no direct coupling, and is readily generalized to other remote gates or larger topological networks.

  Step 4: This idea is novel because it proposes a teleportation-based remote CNOT between two abstract qubits that represent a topological corner mode and an exciton-polariton mode, explicitly forbidding any direct photon source between them. No prior Pytheus design has enforced such an enforced “no‐link” while still realizing a full two-qubit gate.

  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus since it only requires probabilistic Bell-pair sources, linear optics, photon‐number–resolving detectors, and ancilla heralding—exactly the toolbox Pytheus optimizes. We only specify the abstract target transformation (CNOT truth table), and Pytheus will find the optical layout.

Action: final answer
Action Input: 
Explanation: 
We propose to implement a heralded, measurement-based remote CNOT gate between two abstract qubits labelled “corner mode” (control) and “polaritonic state” (target) with no direct photon‐pair source connecting them. The network uses two Bell‐pair sources—one entangling the corner‐mode qubit with ancilla photons and one entangling the polariton qubit with other ancillas—and a linear-optics network plus photon‐number–resolving detections that jointly measure the four ancillas. Upon successful heralding, the remaining two qubits have undergone a CNOT operation. This demonstrates entanglement‐swapping–assisted gate teleportation in a topologically inspired setting and can be generalized to remote controlled gates across larger corner/polariton networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal essentially implements a heralded, measurement‐based remote CNOT via entanglement swapping and Bell‐measurement teleportation—exactly the type of remote CNOT gate we already know can be done (e.g. the “Heralded CNOT Gate (3,3)” and the PT‐symmetric filter–enhanced teleportation CNOT). Merely relabeling the two logical qubits as a “corner mode” and a “polaritonic state” does not add a genuinely new operational primitive or target to the field. To be PRL‐worthy, the scheme would need a feature or functionality beyond a standard heralded, entanglement‐swapping–based remote CNOT—e.g. a novel topology‐protected gate mechanism that cannot be decomposed into known teleportation steps.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The core is just teleportation‐based CNOT already explored by heralded CNOT gate experiments; labeling qubits as “corner” vs. “polaritonic” does not introduce a fundamentally new primitive. Please propose a truly novel gate or network functionality that goes beyond existing heralded CNOT constructions.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to fuse “polaritonic state” and “corner mode” in a Pytheus‐compatible network:
    1) Remote gate teleportation (heralded CPHASE between corner and polaritonic qubits).  
    2) Dimension‐mismatched swapping (use qubit–qutrit resources at the polariton node to swap entanglement between two corner qubits).  
    3) Programmable entanglement router: a single linear‐optical network that, by two distinct patterns of ancilla clicks, heralds either a Bell pair on the two corner nodes or on the two polariton nodes.

  Step 2: Check novelty & obstacles:
    1) Gate teleportation has already been implemented (Heralded CNOT).  
    2) Mismatched‐dimensional swapping reduces to standard qubit swapping unless one truly uses all three levels—but Pytheus can’t distinguish physical encodings, so it collapses to qubit ES.  
    3) The programmable router is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment realizes one static network that can swap entanglement along two different “paths” purely by choosing which ancilla‐detector subset to herald on. It goes beyond simple ES or single‐function heralded gates.

  Step 3: Pick the entanglement‐routing switch as the most promising: it’s a network transformation, not just state generation; it leverages polariton‐labeled and corner‐labeled qubits in a new way; and it’s readily expressed in Pytheus (Bell‐pair sources, linear optics, ancilla + heralding patterns).

  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements, for the first time, a passive, measurement‐based entanglement router: the same linear‐optical layout can, depending on which subset of ancilla detectors click, entangle either the two corner‐mode qubits or the two polaritonic qubits—no active reconfiguration or feedback needed.

  Step 5: It’s feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires:
     • Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources (one between corner node 0 & polariton node 1, one between polariton node 3 & corner node 2)  
     • A linear optics interferometer mixing all four signal modes plus four ancilla modes  
     • Photon‐number resolving detectors on the four ancilla outputs  
     • Two heralding patterns that post‐select two different 2×2 Bell‐basis outcomes  
     • Constraints forbidding any direct Bell‐pair source between the two corners (0↔2) or the two polariton nodes (1↔3), enforced via removed_connections.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Explanation:
We propose a Programmable Entanglement Router between “corner‐mode” qubits (nodes 0 & 2) and “polaritonic‐state” qubits (nodes 1 & 3).  The same static linear‐optical network plus four ancilla detectors implements two different entanglement‐swapping tasks, selected purely by which pair of ancilla detectors clicks.

Visual layout (photons travel downwards):
emitters:  
  • Source A: Bell‐pair source between node 0 (corner) & node 1 (polariton)  
  • Source B: Bell‐pair source between node 2 (corner) & node 3 (polariton)  
optical network: a generic interferometer mixing modes 0–3 with four ancilla modes  
detectors:  
  • Corner/polariton outputs: modes 0,1,2,3  
  • Ancilla detectors: detectors 4,5,6,7  

Heralding patterns:
  • Pattern X = clicks on {4,5}  → post‐selected output is a Bell state on corner nodes (0&2).  
  • Pattern Y = clicks on {6,7}  → post‐selected output is a Bell state on polariton nodes (1&3).  

No direct sources between the two corners or between the two polaritons:
  removed_connections = [[0,2],[1,3]]

The Expert can feed this target to Pytheus as a multi‐heralded‐out experiment.  Upon success, one obtains a single optical layout that “routes” entanglement either to the corner subnetwork or to the polariton subnetwork entirely by postselection.  This can be generalized to larger arrays of corner/polariton nodes, enabling passive entanglement reconfiguration in topologically inspired photonic networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This is essentially a passive, postselected entanglement‐router that, depending on which ancilla clicks, distributes a Bell pair between one of two node pairs. It maps directly onto the “Quantum Entanglement Router” concept already proposed by the ensemble (and to related spectral‐control and quantum‐switch router primitives). Merely relabeling the qubits as “corner” vs “polaritonic” does not introduce a fundamentally new quantum‐network primitive or target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme duplicates the functionality of previously suggested passive entanglement routers (e.g. the Pythreus‐compatible multiplexed entanglement router and related quantum‐router proposals). To be novel, you need to propose a genuinely new routing mechanism or network primitive (for example, leveraging an operational feature not achievable by existing passive postselection methods, or demonstrating routing in a nontrivial topological or indefinite‐order setting that cannot be decomposed into known entanglement‐swap steps).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “polaritonic state” and “corner mode” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (no state‐generation targets, only transformations)  
    1) Coherent‐multipath teleportation: teleport a qubit from a “corner” node A to another “corner” node B via two “polaritonic” mediators X and Y in coherent superposition, using four Bell‐pair sources and a single four‐ancilla interferometric measurement that erases which‐path information.  
    2) Superposed‐order entanglement‐swapping (“quantum switch”): realize two entanglement‐swapping orders (swap A–X then Y–B vs. X–B then A–Y) in coherent superposition by post‐selection using a single linear‐optical network and four ancilla detectors—no feedback.  
    3) Heralded multi‐mode parity check: perform a joint parity measurement on a corner qubit and a polariton qubit by splitting two parallel Bell‐swap channels and interfering ancillas, giving a nondemolition projection onto the even/odd subspaces without directly coupling the signal modes.  
  Step 2: Novelty & Pytheus feasibility  
    1) Coherent‐multipath teleportation is novel—nothing in the explored list uses two parallel teleportation channels in superposition to realize a single identity channel. It’s purely a network transformation (identity map on an unknown qubit) and uses only Bell‐pair sources, linear optics, and ancilla detectors—perfectly within Pytheus’s toolbox.  
    2) Superposed‐order swap is conceptually intriguing but might be over‐ambitious for Pytheus since implementing an indefinite causal order via static post‐selection is subtle and untested in existing Pytheus examples.  
    3) Heralded parity check is interesting but closer in spirit to existing analyzers (Mean King, Yeo‐Chua) and less striking than true coherent‐path interference.  
  Step 3: Select the coherent‐multipath teleportation network as the best balance of novelty, conceptual clarity, and Pytheus‐compatibility.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because it implements a single‐qubit teleportation (an identity channel) between two “corner‐mode” qubits by putting the quantum information through two distinct “polaritonic” entanglement links simultaneously and coherently. No previous Pytheus design has realized a superposition of teleportation paths to achieve one heralded identity map.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it only requires:  
    – Four probabilistic Bell‐pair sources: two between input corner A and mediators X,Y; two between mediators X,Y and output corner B  
    – A single linear‐optical interferometer mixing all four ancilla modes  
    – Four photon‐number–resolving detectors on the ancilla outputs  
    – One heralding pattern (a specific 4‐click event) that post‐selects the identity channel on the input qubit  
    – A single removed_connections constraint forbidding any direct pair source between A and B  
All of these are well within Pytheus’s optimization capabilities.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
Explanation:  
We propose to implement Coherent‐Multipath Quantum Teleportation of an unknown qubit from a “corner‐mode” node A to another “corner‐mode” node B by sending it simultaneously through two “polaritonic” mediator nodes X and Y. A single static linear‐optical network plus four ancilla detectors performs a joint four‐photon measurement that erases which‐path information and heralds successful teleportation.

Heralding:  
  heralding_out = [[4,5,6,7]]  (a single 4‐click pattern)  

Target transformation:  
  identity channel on the corner qubit: |ψ⟩₀ → |ψ⟩₁  

Why it’s novel  
  – No prior Pytheus example has realized teleportation along two parallel entanglement links put into coherent superposition.  
  – It exposes genuinely new network physics: interference of teleportation paths.  

Why it’s feasible  
  – Uses only probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, linear optics, number‐resolving detectors, and post‐selection  
  – Fits exactly into Pytheus’s state‐abstract, measurement‐based optimization framework

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposed “coherent‐multipath” teleportation network is essentially the same static linear‐optics motif as the ensemble’s “Dual‐Path Teleportation Emulation of the J₁–J₂ Frustrated Heisenberg Dimer,” except you drop the physical mapping to J₁–J₂ physics and merely teleport through two parallel links. That scheme already demonstrates teleportation via two interfering Bell‐swap paths, heralded by a single multi‐click pattern. Stripping off the Heisenberg emulation leaves exactly your protocol, so there’s no genuinely new primitive here.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This is too close to the ensemble’s dual‐path teleportation proposal (two Bell-swaps in coherent superposition). To be novel, you need an operational feature or target that goes beyond mere coherent superposition of two teleportation paths already studied.

Researcher (o4-mini): Explanation:  
We propose a heralded, measurement-based Fredkin gate (controlled-SWAP) between a “polaritonic” qubit (control at node 0) and two “corner” qubits (targets at nodes 1 & 2). In this transformation the states ∣c,a,b⟩₀₁₂ are mapped to ∣c, a⊕c·(b–a), b⊕c·(a–b)⟩₀₁₂—in other words, if the polariton qubit is |1⟩ it swaps the two corner qubits, otherwise it leaves them untouched.  

No direct Bell-pair source connects the two corner qubits (removed_connections = [[1,2]]), ensuring the swap is mediated purely via ancilla. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources inject entanglement between each logical qubit and ancilla modes. A static linear-optical network mixes all ancilla modes, and four photon-number-resolving detectors herald a successful Fredkin when they click in a specific 4-click pattern.  

This realizes a non-trivial three-qubit gate transformation—never before implemented in Pytheus—with an explicit “polaritonic vs. corner” labeling. It opens the door to measurement-based photonic implementations of other topologically motivated or hybrid-mode quantum processors.

Researcher (o4-mini): Explanation:
We propose to implement a heralded, measurement-based Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate between a “corner‐mode” qubit (control) and two “polaritonic” qubits (targets) using only probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, linear optics, photon‐number‐resolving detectors, and post-selection.  No direct Bell‐pair source is allowed between the control (corner) and either polariton target—i.e. the swapping must be mediated purely by the ancilla photons and the interferometer.

Visual layout (photons propagate top→bottom):

 emitters (Bell‐pair sources):
   • Source A between node 0 (corner control) and ancilla 3  
   • Source B between node 1 (polariton target₁) and ancilla 4  
   • Source C between node 2 (polariton target₂) and ancilla 5  

 static linear-optical network mixing ancilla modes 3,4,5  
 detectors:
   • Signal outputs (post-gate qubits): modes 0,1,2  
   • Ancilla detectors: D3, D4, D5  

 Constraint: removed_connections = [[0,1],[0,2]]  
  (forbid any source directly linking corner-mode node 0 to polariton nodes 1 or 2)

 Heralding: a particular 3-click pattern on {D3,D4,D5} signals a successful Fredkin.

 Target logical truth-table on (c,t₁,t₂) basis:
   000→000  
   001→001  
   010→010  
   011→011  
   100→100  
   101→110  
   110→101  
   111→111  

Why it’s novel:
 • No existing Pytheus example implements a three-qubit Fredkin gate purely by measurement and post-selection.  
 • Labels “corner-mode” vs. “polaritonic” serve to connect topological corner/quasiparticle concepts to the network primitive.  
 • This heralded Fredkin can be generalized to swap arbitrary pairs of qubits under an ancilla-mediated control, enabling new topologically inspired quantum-routing and network-programming protocols.

Why it’s feasible:
 • Uses only probabilistic Bell‐pair sources (which Pytheus supports) and linear optics  
 • Employs photon‐number‐resolving detectors for heralding (standard in Pytheus)  
 • No dynamic feedback—pure post-selection—fits within Pytheus’s optimization framework

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
  Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to meaningfully combine “polaritonic state” and “corner mode” in a Pytheus‐compatible quantum network (no state‐generation, only transformations):
    1) Remote parity‐check gate: perform a nondemolition parity measurement between a corner‐qubit and a polariton‐qubit by interfering two Bell‐swap channels and heralding on ancilla clicks.
    2) Programmable entanglement router: one static interferometer that, by choosing different heralding clicks, swaps entanglement either between corner–corner or between polariton–polariton.
    3) Hybrid‐dimensional teleportation: teleport an unknown qubit in the “corner mode” to a two‐dimensional subspace of a three‐level “polaritonic” node (or vice versa), using two Bell‐pair sources plus a single four‐photon joint measurement.
  Step 2: Check novelty & obstacles:
    1) Parity check is too close to existing analyzers (Mean King, Yeo‐Chua).  
    2) Router was already dismissed as too similar to multiplexed entanglement routers.  
    3) Hybrid‐dimensional teleportation has not been explored. It is a genuine network transformation (teleportation) but with dimension‐mismatch between input and output.  
  Step 3: Select the hybrid‐dimensional teleportation.  
  Step 4: This idea is novel because Pytheus has only implemented teleportation of same‐dimensional qudits. Teleporting between different dimensions opens a new class of network primitives—dimension‐converting quantum channels—without altering the unknown input.  
  Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework since it only uses:
    • Two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources  
    • A linear‐optical interferometer mixing the four ancilla photons  
    • Four photon‐number–resolving detectors for heralding  
    • A single heralding pattern (no feedback)

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Explanation:
We propose a Hybrid‐Dimensional Teleportation network that takes an arbitrary unknown qubit in a “corner‐mode” node (A, dimension=2) and teleports it into a two‐level subspace of a “polaritonic” node (B, dimension=3).  The same static linear‐optical setup plus a one‐shot heralding event enacts the identity channel |ψ⟩ₐ → |ψ⟩ᵦ (embedded in the qutrit subspace spanned by |0⟩,|1⟩), with the level |2⟩ unused.

Visual layout (top→bottom):
emitters (Bell‐pair sources):
  • Source 1 entangles node 0 (corner A, dim 2) with ancilla mode 2  
  • Source 2 entangles node 1 (polaritonic B, dim 3) with ancilla mode 3  
optical network: generic interferometer mixing ancilla modes 2,3,4,5  
detectors:
  • Signal outputs: mode 0 (input) and mode 1 (output)  
  • Ancilla detectors: modes 2,3,4,5  

Constraint:
  removed_connections = [[0,1]]  (no direct Bell‐pair source between A & B)

Heralding:
  heralding_out = [[2,3,4,5]]  (a single 4‐click event)

Target transformation:
  identity channel from qubit at node 0 to qutrit‐subspace at node 1:
    |0⟩₀ → |0⟩₁  
    |1⟩₀ → |1⟩₁

This network implements teleportation with dimension conversion, unlocking a new class of quantum‐network transforms.  It can be generalized to qubit→qudit, qudit→qubit, or qudit→qudit teleportation with arbitrary dimension changes.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The notion of teleporting an unknown qubit into a higher‐dimensional node—realizing an identity channel |ψ⟩₂→|ψ⟩₃-subspace in one heralded, static linear-optical measurement—is genuinely different from existing all-qubit or all-qudit teleportation schemes. It defines a new primitive for heterogeneous quantum networks (qubit‐to‐qutrit conversion) rather than merely swapping or routing entanglement. I see no direct counterpart in the human-explored list or ensemble suggestions, and it goes beyond simple state generation by implementing a nontrivial channel.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This hybrid-dimensional teleportation target introduces a new primitive (qubit→qutrit channel) for measurement-based linear-optical networks. It leverages entangled sources of mismatched dimension and a single heralded 4-click event to achieve identity mapping into a subspace of a three-level node—a capability not previously proposed. This could open avenues for interfacing heterogeneous quantum nodes in a network and is worth detailed investigation.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Hybrid‐Dimensional Teleportation: Qubit‐to‐Qutrit State Transfer

Mini-Abstract: We propose a linear-optical, heralded teleportation experiment that takes an arbitrary, unknown qubit state encoded in a two‐level “corner” mode at node A and maps it identically into a two‐level subspace of a three‐level “polaritonic” qutrit at node B using two probabilistic Bell‐pair sources, a static four‐ancilla interferometer, and a single four‐click heralding event. This scheme realizes qubit→qutrit teleportation with explicit dimension conversion—extending photonic network primitives to cross‐dimensional quantum information transfer.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal essentially amounts to standard photonic qubit teleportation into a two‐dimensional subspace of a qutrit mode, which is a trivial embedding rather than a genuine cross‐dimensional mapping, and it also relies on feed‐forward correction that falls outside PyTheus’s static post‐selection framework. The physics is sound but offers little novelty since the third level is never actively used and the required teleportation corrections cannot be designed by PyTheus’s current graphs‐only methodology.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This scheme is physically valid but boils down to ordinary qubit teleportation into a qubit‐encoded subspace of a qutrit without exploring the extra level, and it requires dynamic feed-forward corrections that the PyTheus static‐graph approach cannot support.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “polaritonic state” and “corner mode” in a purely network‐transformation target (no state generation):
  1) A heralded Fredkin (controlled‐SWAP) gate: use a corner‐mode qubit as control and two polariton qubits as targets.  
  2) A measurement‐based controlled‐phase gate where a corner qubit controls a CZ between two polariton qubits.  
  3) A multi‐party remote SWAP: swap a corner qubit with a polariton qubit at a distance via chained entanglement‐swapping.

Step 2: Novelty & obstacles:
  1) Fredkin: Pytheus has designed heralded CNOT/Toffoli but not a Fredkin. It’s a genuine three‐qubit network primitive. Feasible with linear optics + ancillas.  
  2) Controlled‐phase: similar to CNOT, less novel.  
  3) Remote SWAP: reduces to two sequential teleportations—no new feature.

Step 3: Choose the heralded Fredkin gate—novel, purely a network transformation, directly within Pytheus’s toolbox.

Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus experiment implements a linear‐optical, heralded controlled‐SWAP (Fredkin) between abstract qubits.  

Step 5: It’s feasible in Pytheus because it uses:
  • Three single‐photon inputs (corner control + two polariton targets)  
  • Four ancillary photons  
  • A static interferometer + photon‐number‐resolving detectors  
  • One heralding pattern (no feedback)  
  • A removed_connections rule forbidding direct pair‐sources between control and targets  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Explanation:
We propose a heralded, measurement‐based Fredkin gate (controlled‐SWAP) where the “corner‐mode” qubit (node 0) controls a SWAP of two “polaritonic” qubits (nodes 1 & 2).  Upon a specific four‐ancilla‐click pattern, the remaining three photons have undergone the transformation
  |c,t₁,t₂⟩ → |c, t_{c⊕1}, t_{c}⟩,
i.e. if the corner‐control is 0 the polariton qubits stay in order; if it is 1 they swap.

Layout (top→bottom):
emitters (single‐photon sources):
  • node 0: corner control  
  • node 1: polariton target A  
  • node 2: polariton target B  
  • ancilla sources: four single‐photon emitters  

linear‐optical network: mixes the six modes  
detectors:
  • signal outputs: nodes 0,1,2  
  • ancillas: detectors 3,4,5,6  

Constraints:
  removed_connections = [[0,1],[0,2]]  (no direct Bell pairs needed since we start from single‐photon qubits)

Heralding:
  heralding_out = [[3,4,5,6]]  (one chosen 4‐click event)

Target transformation:
  Fredkin truth table on qubit basis:
    00 0→00 0, 01 0→01 0, 10 1→10 1, 11 1→11 1, and swap targets if control=1.

This network is a new transformation primitive—controlled‐SWAP—pushing beyond CNOT/Toffoli.  Pytheus can optimize the beam splitter network and ancilla paths to realize this heralded Fredkin with linear optics and photon‐number‐resolving detection, no dynamic feed‐forward needed.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal to realize a heralded, measurement‐based Fredkin gate (controlled‐SWAP) in a purely static linear‐optics network with single‐photon inputs and four‐click postselection goes beyond known CNOT/Toffoli and ring‐exchange primitives. No prior scheme in our list or the ensemble directly implements a three‐qubit controlled‐SWAP in this heralded, feed‐forward‐free fashion. This is a genuinely new processing primitive for photonic quantum networks and merits further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This heralded Fredkin gate target introduces a new three‐qubit controlled‐SWAP primitive achievable with only single‐photon sources, passive interferometry, and number‐resolving detection—without dynamic feed‐forward. It extends beyond existing CNOT/Toffoli and cyclic swap demonstrations and opens the door to richer measurement‐based multi‐qubit logic in linear optics.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits

Mini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a “corner-mode” single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table—swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1⟩ state—without any dynamic feed-forward.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal leverages known techniques—ancilla‐driven heralding and polarization‐encoded qubits—to implement the nontrivial three‐qubit Fredkin gate in a fully measurement‐based, feed-forward-free linear-optical circuit. It sits squarely in PyTheus’s sweet spot of designing heralded multi-photon gates and appears both novel (no published feed-forward-free Fredkin) and physically realizable with current bulk-optic or integrated photonic components.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a promising and technically sound application of PyTheus to heralded three-qubit logic. The feed-forward-free Fredkin implementation on polarization targets is a novel contribution and should be within reach of modern linear-optical labs using standard photon‐pair sources, polarizing beam splitters, and photon-number-resolving detectors.
