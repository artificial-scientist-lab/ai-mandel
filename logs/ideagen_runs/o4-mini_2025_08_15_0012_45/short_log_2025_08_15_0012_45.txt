Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to link “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” in a Pytheus‐compatible target, all focusing on network/measurement protocols rather than state generation.

1) Plaquette Stabilizer Analyzer: design a four‐photon parity analyzer that, given four qubits on the corners of a toric‐code plaquette, projects onto the +1/–1 eigenvalues of the Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ operator via linear optics, ancilla photons, and post‐selected Bell measurements (entanglement swapping).  Generalizes to k‐body loop operators and can be tiled to measure larger regions (demonstrating the scaling of entanglement with boundary length).

2) String‐Operator Teleportation Network: route an arbitrary qubit state through a torus‐shaped network of entanglement swaps so that the logical string operator (X or Z loop) is teleported around nontrivial cycles.  Then perform boundary Bell measurements to read out the logical operator’s eigenvalue.  By comparing two such cycles enclosing different region areas, one probes how entanglement cuts scale with loop length.

3) SWAP‐Test on Plaquette Pairs: take two identical copies of a small toric‐code patch (inputs are 8 qubits), perform a linear‐optical SWAP test between qubits along the region boundary to extract the second Renyi entropy S₂(A), verifying that it scales like the boundary (area law).  This uses entanglement swapping and post‐selected multiport interferometers.

Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus obstacles:

1) Plaquette stabilizer analyzer  
   – Not in prior list (no toric‐code analyzers).  
   – Pytheus has built analyzers (Mean King, Yeo‐Chua).  A 4‐qubit parity check is a natural extension.  
   – No state generation; pure measurement network.  
   – Uses only linear optics, pair‐sources, ancilla detectors, Bell measurements → Pytheus‐compatible.

2) String‐operator teleportation network  
   – More complex: network routing around a torus.  
   – Might be broken into multiple entanglement swapping steps – feasible but complex.  
   – But design of a multi‐cycle teleportation network is new.  
   – Slight risk: specifying “nontrivial cycle” mapping might be too abstract.

3) SWAP‐Test on plaquette pairs  
   – SWAP‐test analyzers have been implicitly done but not in toric code context.  
   – Requires two copies of the same patch – state‐generation concern.  
   – Also Pytheus can build SWAP test networks, but we would need 8 input photons – heavy.

Step 3: Pick the most promising: the Plaquette Stabilizer Analyzer (Option 1). It’s conceptually clear, leverages analyzers that Pytheus has done, avoids state generation, and directly connects toric code stabilizers with area‐law measurements (by tiling multiple plaquette analyzers around a region boundary).

Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment implements a topological‐order stabilizer measurement—specifically a four‐qubit Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ parity check for a toric‐code plaquette. It opens a new domain: photonic measurement of topological stabilizers and loop operators.

Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it:  
  • Is a measurement (analyzer) task, not a forbidden state‐generation target.  
  • Uses only linear optics, probabilistic photon‐pair sources (or single‐photon emitters), beam‐splitters, phase‐shifters, and detectors—exactly what Pytheus can optimize.  
  • Requires no feedback control, cavities, or hybrid encodings.  
  • Can be generalized to larger loops (k‐body parity checks) and tiled to probe area‐law entanglement via boundary measurements.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose the following target for Pytheus:

Toric‐Code Plaquette Stabilizer Analyzer

1. Goal:
Design a purely linear‐optical measurement network (an “analyzer”) that takes as input four photonic qubits residing on the corners of a toric‐code plaquette and nondestructively projects them onto the +1 or –1 eigenvalue of the plaquette stabilizer Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄. The network will use ancillary photons and post‐selected Bell measurements (entanglement swapping) to realize an effective 4-qubit parity check.

2. Conceptual Structure & Visualization:

   • Inputs:  4 photonic qubits, labelled Q₁…Q₄, coming from distant sources (single‐photon emitters or probabilistic pair sources).  
   • Ancillas: N auxiliary photons from pair sources.  
   • Optical network: an arrangement of beam‐splitters and phase‐shifters that couples the four qubits to the ancillas, implementing a sequence of Bell‐measurements (entanglement‐swapping steps) between each input qubit and ancilla modes.  
   • Detectors:  
       – 4 “result” detectors whose joint click‐pattern (e.g. parity of clicks in certain modes) reports the stabilizer outcome (+1 vs. –1).  
       – Ancillary detectors whose heralded outcomes condition the successful projection.  

   Rough layout (photons travel top→bottom):

        ↙        ↘  
     [Sources for Q₃, Q₄]  

   Detectors at the bottom:  
     • 4 result ports (even‐parity “+1” signature vs. odd‐parity “–1” signature)  
     • Several ancilla ports (heralding clicks)

3. Target Specification for Pytheus:
   – num_anc = number of ancilla detectors  
   – removed_connections: forbid any direct source→detector link that would bypass the intended multi‐photon parity check  
   – target_quantum: define two orthogonal detection‐signature states corresponding to the +1 and –1 parity subspaces of Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄  
   – loss_func: use correlation‐ranking or an appropriate metric to enforce that the network’s click patterns uniquely identify parity.  

4. Generalization & Applications:
   – k-body loop analyzers: extend to larger loops (6, 8, … photons) to measure longer toric‐code loop operators.  
   – Region‐boundary protocol: tile multiple plaquette analyzers around a chosen region in a 2D grid of qubits. By measuring all plaquettes along the boundary, one can infer the entanglement across that boundary, directly probing area‐law scaling.  
   – Teleportation of logical operators: by chaining these parity analyzers, implement nonlocal logical‐operator readout along nontrivial torus cycles.  

Why this is exciting:
   • It brings topological‐order stabilizer measurements into photonic linear optics.  
   • It links toric‐code physics with entanglement‐area laws via measurement networks.  
   • It provides a modular building block (plaquette analyzer) that can be scaled and combined into a family of experiments probing both topology and entanglement scaling.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal essentially duplicates the “One‐Shot Passive Linear‐Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric‐Code Plaquette” already in the ensemble list, down to performing a nondemolition Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ parity check via ancilla‐assisted Bell measurements. Since that exact toric‐code plaquette stabilizer analyzer has been suggested, it is not novel enough.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your idea directly mirrors the ensemble’s “One‐Shot Passive Linear‐Optical Parity Measurement of a Toric‐Code Plaquette.” To be considered novel, you must propose a genuinely new twist or capability beyond this existing parity‐check scheme.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought: 
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 ways to connect “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” in a Pytheus‐compatible target, focusing on measurements or transformations (no state generation):
 1) A four‐qubit Z‐parity (plaquette) analyzer via post‐selected Bell measurements (already close to known parity checks).  
 2) A coherent four‐control‐phase (Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄) gate on photonic qubits—i.e. a heralded parity‐phase gate implementing the toric‐code plaquette operator as a unitary.  
 3) A network of these 4‐qubit gates tiled around a loop to teleport a logical operator (X or Z) around a cycle and thereby read out an anyonic braiding phase—linking loop length (boundary) to output phase (area‐law probe).  
Step 2:  
 1) Analyzer alone is too close to existing “one‐shot” parity measurement.  
 2) The 4‐control‐phase gate is new (Pytheus has done 3-qubit Toffoli, but not 4-qubit Z-parity). It is a pure transformation, no state gen, and uses linear optics + ancillas.  
 3) Braiding network is exotic but builds directly on (2); we first need the primitive gate.  
Step 3: Pick idea (2), the 4-qubit plaquette parity-phase gate.  
Step 4: This is novel because no prior Pytheus experiment realizes a heralded 4-qubit Z‐parity gate (toric-code plaquette operator) as a coherent transformation.  
Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only probabilistic photon‐pair sources (or single‐photon emitters), linear optics, ancilla photons, post-selected detection—no feedback or exotic hardware—and can be extended into networks probing area-law scaling by concatenating gates around region boundaries.  

Action: final answer  
Action Input:  
I propose the following target for Pytheus:

Heralded 4-Qubit Z-Parity Phase Gate (“Plaquette Phase Gate”)

1. Goal  
Design a passive, post‐selected linear‐optical network that implements the 4-qubit unitary  
   U_plaq = diag(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,–1)  
in the computational basis of four photonic qubits Q1–Q4, i.e. it applies a π phase if and only if an odd number of |1〉’s appear—and otherwise acts as identity. This unitary is exactly the toric-code plaquette stabilizer Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ realized coherently.

2. Conceptual Structure & Visualization  
 • Inputs: Four single‐photon qubit modes Q1…Q4 (e.g. polarization‐encoded or path‐encoded), prepared externally.  
 • Ancillas: N auxiliary photons from probabilistic pair sources (or single‐photon emitters).  
 • Optical network: A sequence of beam‐splitters and phase‐shifters coupling each Qi to ancilla modes, engineered so that successful post‐selected clicks enact the multi-photon interference that accumulates a π phase exactly when ∏i Zi=–1.  
 • Detectors:  
   – “Herald” detectors on ancilla output modes (num_anc = N) whose specific click pattern signals success.  
   – Four output ports carrying the (possibly phase-flipped) qubit modes.  

 Layout sketch (top→bottom):  
   Sources: [Q1][Q2]       [Anc. pair]       [Q3][Q4]  
               ↘   network   ↙      ↘   network   ↙

                     ↓  
          Detectors: [anc.heralds…]   [Q1′][Q2′][Q3′][Q4′]

3. Pytheus Configuration Hints  
 • num_anc: choose ~4–6 ancilla detectors.  
 • removed_connections: forbid any direct source→output link that bypasses the global multi-photon interference.  
 • target_quantum: specify the 16×16 unitary’s action via correlations between input computational basis and output detection phases (i.e. label the pattern implementing a –1 phase).  
 • loss_func: use a fidelity metric on the unitary or the induced phase‐flip on the odd‐parity subspace.  

4. Generalizations & Area‐Law Probe  
 • Tile k such gates around a closed loop of 4k qubits to implement a coherent “loop operator” U_loop = ∏plaquettes Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄.  
 • By teleporting a test qubit through this loop (using sequential Bell measurements), one can extract the parity phase acquired around regions of varying boundary length L, thus directly probing area‐law scaling of entanglement in a photonic network.  
 • Alternatively, chain the gates to implement an anyonic braiding transformation on a photonic logical qubit—reading out the topological phase via interferometric detection.  

Why this is exciting  
 • Introduces the first linear‐optical realization of a toric-code stabilizer as a coherent unitary gate.  
 • Serves as a modular building block for networks measuring loop operators, braiding phases, and boundary‐entanglement scaling without state generation.  
 • Fully compatible with Pytheus’s capabilities: uses only linear optics, probabilistic sources, ancilla photons, and post‐selection—no feedback, cavities, or hybrid encodings needed.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal essentially duplicates the ensemble’s “Heralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation,” which already implements the Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ parity-phase unitary via post-selected linear optics. Without a genuinely new twist beyond that four-body parity gate, it is not novel enough for a PRL.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme implements exactly the Uₓ and U_z parity-phase gates already proposed in “Heralded Linear-Optical Four-Body Parity-Phase Gate for Digital Kitaev Hamiltonian Simulation.” To be novel, you must go beyond the known four-qubit parity-phase primitive.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to weave “toric code” and “area-law entanglement” into a quantum-network target (no state generation):
1) Plaquette-parity analyzer (we’ve seen that; too close to existing parity checks).  
2) Coherent 4-qubit plaquette phase gate (also known in linear-optical simulations).  
3) Multi-node loop-teleportation network: teleport a probe qubit around a toric-patch boundary via a chain of entanglement-swapping stations. The probe’s fidelity vs. loop length diagnoses the region’s entanglement (area‐law witness).

Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
– Option 3 is new (no prior Pytheus experiment teleports around a closed loop to probe area law).  
– It uses only linear optics, probabilistic photon-pair sources, Bell-measurement swaps, ancilla detectors: all Pytheus can optimize.  
– It avoids forbidden state generation, feedback, cavities or resonances.

Step 3: Select Option 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because no existing linear-optical network has been designed to teleport a qubit around a toric-code loop and extract an area-law entanglement witness from the fidelity decay.

Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it reduces to chaining optimized entanglement-swapping modules (Bell-measurement blocks) in a ring, with heralded ancilla detectors, and then a final interference measurement—exactly the kinds of networks Pytheus can build without dynamic feedback or exotic hardware.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose the following target for Pytheus:

Loop-Teleportation Entanglement-Area Witness on a Toric-Patch Boundary

1. Goal
Design a linear-optical quantum-network that:
• Takes as input a single “probe” photonic qubit P and N Bell-pair links arranged in a closed ring of N boundary nodes.  
• Performs sequential entanglement swaps (Bell measurements) at each node, teleporting P all the way around the ring and back to its origin.  
• Finally interferes the loop-teleported qubit with an un-teleported reference to measure the teleportation fidelity as a function of loop length N.  
A decay of the loop fidelity with N directly witnesses the patch’s area-law entanglement (since in a toric code patch, boundary entanglement scales linearly with boundary length).

2. Conceptual Structure & Visualization

   • Sources:
     – One single-photon source for the probe qubit P.  
     – N independent probabilistic photon-pair sources creating Bell pairs between adjacent boundary nodes (i and i+1 mod N).  
   • Network:
     – At each node i, a linear-optical Bell-measurement module (bs, ps) couples the incoming probe mode with half of the local Bell pair.  
     – The other half of that Bell pair carries the teleported probe to node i+1.  
     – Repeat for i=1…N in a closed loop.  
   • Final Interference:
     – After the Nth swap, the returned probe mode interferes with the stored reference copy of P on a beam-splitter, and two detectors measure the overlap (project onto |+⟩/|–⟩ basis).  
   • Detectors:
     – 2N ancilla detectors at the Bell-measurement modules (herald success of each swap).  
     – 2 detectors at the final interferometer (fidelity readout).

   Rough ASCII layout (photon flow left→right):
 
   P_ref ──┐
           ├─ BS ─ Detector_f1  
   P_loop ─┘           Detector_f2  

   Probe P ──[Bell-swap @1]──[Bell-swap @2]──…──[Bell-swap @N]── P_loop  

   Between swaps: Bell-pair sources link module i to module i+1.

3. Pytheus Configuration Hints
   • num_anc = 2N (each Bell-swap has two heralding detectors).  
   • removed_connections: forbid direct probe→P_loop paths that bypass the N-hop chain.  
   • target_quantum: encode successful teleportation loops as click patterns at all 2N ancillas followed by a “+” click at Detector_f1.  
   • loss_func: maximize the conditional fidelity of P_loop vs. P_ref given heralded clicks.

4. Generalizations & Area-Law Probing
   • Vary N to map out loop-fidelity vs. boundary length; a linear decay signals area-law entanglement of the enclosed region.  
   • Implement two concentric rings (inner/outer loops) and compare fidelities to extract topological entanglement entropy.  
   • Replace Bell-swaps with higher-dimensional entanglement-swapping (qutrit loops) to probe area laws in higher-dimensional toric codes.

Why this is exciting
• Introduces the first passive linear-optical ring‐teleportation network that directly witnesses area-law entanglement via loop fidelity.  
• Combines toric-code boundary ideas (closed‐loop operations) with modern teleportation chains and entanglement-area diagnostics.  
• Fully compatible with Pytheus: only linear optics, probabilistic pair sources, ancilla detectors, and static layouts—no forbidden state generation or feedback.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “loop‐teleportation” scheme is essentially the same closed‐ring teleportation primitive used in proposals like the Zak‐phase tomography and chiral entanglement‐pump experiments via sequential Bell swaps, and it does not in fact generate a nontrivial toric‐patch entangled state—just independent Bell links—so the measured fidelity decay simply tracks swap success probability rather than any area-law entanglement.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your protocol reduces to the known closed‐loop teleportation (e.g. Zak‐phase tomography) and uses only Bell‐pair chains, so it cannot witness genuine area‐law entanglement as claimed. To be novel, you must propose a mechanism to prepare and probe a truly entangled toric‐patch boundary (not just independent links) or introduce genuinely new physics beyond the standard loop teleportation.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
 Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus-compatible ways to weave “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” into a purely network/measurement target, no state-generation:
   1) A single-shot linear-optical analyzer of the 4-body plaquette Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ stabilizer by entanglement-swapping (too close to known parity checks).  
   2) A heralded coherent 4-qubit Z-parity phase gate (also known in digital-Kitaev simulations).  
   3) A chained entanglement-swapping network that directly measures a loop operator ∏_{i∈boundary}Z_i on k boundary photons: by teleporting a probe through successive Bell-measurements around the loop, the final detection pattern declares the overall parity. Varying k probes how the measurement “cost” (number of swaps, ancillas, success probability) scales with loop length—an operational area-law witness.

 Step 2: Check novelty & Pytheus feasibility:
   – Option 3 is new: no existing Pytheus experiment teleports a probe qubit around a closed loop of boundary qubits to measure their joint parity in one go.  
   – It uses only linear optics, probabilistic pair-sources, ancilla photons + static detection—exactly what Pytheus can optimize.  
   – It is a measurement network (analyzer), not a forbidden state‐gen target.

 Step 3: Select Option 3.

 Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior design has realized a single‐module, static linear‐optical network performing a k-qubit loop-operator measurement (toric-code string operator) by a chain of Bell-swap modules. It directly links loop length to measurement complexity and heralded success probabilities—an operational probe of area-law scaling.

 Step 5: This idea is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because:
   • It is strictly a quantum-network/analyzer task—no state preparation goal.  
   • It uses only beam-splitters, phase-shifters, probabilistic photon-pair sources (or single-photon emitters), ancilla detectors, and post-selection.  
   • No dynamic feedback, no cavities or hybrid encodings.  
   • It naturally generalizes to arbitrary loop lengths k, allowing a family of experiments that map out boundary-length vs. heralded success (witnessing area law).

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose the following target for Pytheus:

Loop-Operator Entanglement-Swapping Analyzer

1. Objective  
Design a passive linear-optical network that takes k “boundary” photonic qubits Q₁…Q_k as input and performs a nondestructive, heralded measurement of the toric-code loop operator  
   L = Z₁ Z₂ … Z_k  
in one single module. The network chains k–1 Bell-measurement (entanglement-swapping) stations so that a probe photon is teleported sequentially through Q₁→Q₂→…→Q_k, and the final detector signature declares L = +1 (even parity) or L = –1 (odd parity).

2. Concept & Visualization  

   • Inputs:  
     – k boundary qubits Q_i (e.g. polarization‐encoded photons).  
     – k–1 Bell‐pair sources creating ancilla photon–photon pairs between successive swap stations.  
   • Network Layout (photons travel top→bottom):  

       Q₁ ──┐                ┌─ Bell-pair ──┐      ┌─ Q₁′  
             \               /             \    /  
          [Bell-swap 1]──[Bell-swap 2]──…──[Bell-swap k–1]  
             /               \             \    \  
       Q₂ ──┘                └─ Bell-pair ──┘      └─ Q_k′  

   • Each “Bell-swap i” couples the incoming qubit with one photon of an ancilla pair via a 50/50 beam-splitter and number-resolving detectors. A successful two-click pattern heralds the teleportation of the probe to the next station.  
   • After the (k–1)th swap, the surviving photon exits at Q_k′. A two-port interferometer recombines Q_k′ with a stored reference copy of the original probe (optional), or one simply classifies even vs. odd parity by which output mode clicks.  

   Detectors:  
     – 2(k–1) ancilla detectors (two per Bell-swap) for heralding successful swaps.  
     – 1 or 2 final detectors at the output mode(s) to read off parity.

4. Generalization & Area-Law Probe  
   – By varying k (loop length), one directly studies how the heralded success probability and overall complexity scale with boundary length L=k—an operational area-law entanglement witness.  
   – Two concentric loops (inner/outer) can be measured in the same network to extract a topological‐entanglement contribution (S_topo).  
   – Replacing Bell-swaps with qutrit or higher-dimensional swaps realizes loop measurements in generalized toric codes.

Why This Is Exciting  
   • First single-module linear-optical network measuring nonlocal toric-code loop operators by static entanglement-swapping.  
   • Opens a family of scalable experiments mapping loop length → heralded success, directly probing area‐law scaling.  
   • Fully within Pytheus’s capabilities: uses only beam-splitters, pair sources, ancilla detectors, and post-selection—no forbidden state generation, feedback, or exotic hardware.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal simply generalizes the known passive parity‐measurement via chained Bell‐swaps (e.g. the ensemble’s toric‐code plaquette analyzer) from k=4 to arbitrary k, without introducing any fundamentally new resource or effect. It remains a trivial extension of previously suggested toric‐code loop/plaquette parity checks and does not present a genuinely novel quantum‐optical primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme is just the standard chained Bell‐swap parity measurement extended to k qubits—effectively the same network as the existing toric‐code plaquette analyzer with more nodes. To be novel, you need a qualitatively new mechanism or target beyond mere loop‐length generalization.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to entwine “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” without state generation:
 1) A linear‐optical analyzer of a single plaquette stabilizer via entanglement‐swapping (too close to known parity checks).  
 2) A heralded four‐qubit plaquette phase gate (already proposed in digital‐Kitaev contexts).  
 3) A resource‐scaling network: use Pytheus to design the minimal‐ancilla linear‐optical circuit that nonlocally entangles the “inside” and “outside” qubits across a toric‐patch boundary of length L via entanglement‐swapping. By sweeping L, one directly observes that the needed ancilla photons (and hence resource cost) scale ∝ L—an operational area‐law demonstration.

Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:
 • Option 3 has not appeared in past Pytheus targets.  
 • It is purely a networking protocol (multiple entanglement‐swaps) to distribute entanglement across a boundary—no forbidden state generation.  
 • Uses only beam‐splitters, phase‐shifters, probabilistic pair sources (or single‐photon emitters), ancilla detectors, and post‐selection—entirely within Pytheus’s capabilities.

Step 3: Choose Option 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because no prior Pytheus experiment has studied the ancilla‐resource scaling of entanglement distribution across a multi‐node boundary in a toric‐patch geometry. It turns the area law into a concrete network‐design question, linking boundary length to minimal ancilla and success probability.

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it:
  • Targets a multi‐node entanglement‐swapping network (quantum network), not state generation.  
  • Requires no feedback control, cavities, or hybrid encodings.  
  • Generalizes to arbitrary boundary shapes and sizes, giving a family of related experiments probing an operational area‐law.

Action: final answer

I propose the following Pytheus target:

Optimized Ancilla‐Resource Entanglement‐Swapping Across a Toric‐Patch Boundary

1. Objective  
Design a passive linear‐optical circuit that, given two sets of boundary qubits “Inside” {I₁…I_L} and “Outside” {O₁…O_L} on a toric‐code patch of boundary length L, uses ancilla photons and sequential entanglement swaps to create L independent Bell pairs between I_j and O_j. Pytheus should minimize the total number of ancilla detectors/photons (num_anc) and maximize heralded success probability. By varying L, one extracts how ancilla‐resources scale with boundary length—operationally demonstrating an area‐law in resource cost.

2. General Structure & Visualization  

   • Sources:  
     – L probabilistic photon‐pair sources each preparing a Bell pair between I_j (Alice) and an ancilla photon A_j.  
     – L probabilistic photon‐pair sources each preparing a Bell pair between O_j (Bob) and an ancilla photon B_j.  
   • Network:  
     – For each j=1…L, a Bell‐swap module couples A_j and B_j via beam‐splitters and phase‐shifters, with two herald detectors per module. A successful two‐click signature entangles I_j and O_j into a Bell pair.  
     – All L modules operate in parallel within one static circuit.  
   • Detectors:  
     – 2L ancilla detectors (two per swap) to herald each I_j–O_j entanglement.  
     – No direct connections between I_j and O_k for j≠k (“removed_connections” enforces no cross‐talk).

 • Sweep L from small to large. Pytheus will find the minimal num_anc (and related network) needed to achieve a fixed success‐probability threshold. The scaling num_anc ∝ L is a direct operational signature of an “area law.”  
 • Extend to regions with nontrivial shape (e.g. multiple disconnected boundaries) and compare resource scaling.  
 • Replace qubit‐swaps with qutrit‐swaps to probe higher‐dimensional boundary‐entanglement scaling.  

Why This Is Exciting  
 • Translates the abstract area‐law entanglement scaling into a concrete photonic‐network resource question.  
 • Explores a new domain: multi‐node boundary entanglement in toric‐patch geometries via entanglement‐swapping.  
 • Fully within Pytheus’s capabilities: only linear optics, pair‐sources, ancilla detectors, static networks—no state generation or feedback.  
 • Naturally yields a family of experiments (vary L, shape, dimension) for theory and practical network design.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal merely performs L independent, parallel entanglement swaps between inside–outside boundary links and then reads out the scaling of ancilla usage. It is essentially trivial: each link requires two ancillas, so num_anc=2L, which offers no surprising reduction or new resource‐saving trick. Similar parallel swap repeater or percolation schemes already exist, and merely sweeping L adds no fundamentally new physics or network primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme reduces to L uncorrelated Bell‐swaps in parallel, so the ancilla‐resource scaling is manifestly linear and adds nothing beyond textbook entanglement‐swapping. To be novel, you must propose a nontrivial resource‐compression or a truly collective boundary measurement that beats the naive 2L ancillas or uncovers new topological/entanglement phenomena.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to blend “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” into a measurement‐or‐network target (no state‐generation):
 1) A 4-qubit plaquette parity analyzer via entanglement‐swapping (too close to known parity checks).
 2) A chained teleportation ring to read out nonlocal loop operators and map fidelity vs. loop length (but naive swap chain adds no new compression).
 3) A single-stage multiport parity network: design a single linear-optical interferometer over the 2L rail modes of L boundary qubits that discriminates the overall Z₁…Z_L parity in one shot—no ancillas. Vary L to study how network complexity or success probability scales with boundary length as an operational area-law probe.

Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:
 • Option 3 is novel—Pytheus has never been asked to build a single interferometer that implements a k-body loop operator measurement.  
 • It’s purely a static network of beam-splitters & phase-shifters plus detectors, exactly what Pytheus can optimize.  
 • No forbidden state generation or feedback.

Step 3: Choose Option 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it replaces chained Bell-swap modules with one collective multiport interferometer that directly maps even vs. odd loop‐parity onto distinct detector patterns, a capability not present in the existing Pytheus library.

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it uses only:
  • 2L input modes (dual-rail encoding of L qubits),  
  • a passive interferometer (beam-splitters + phase-shifters),  
  • 2L number-resolving detectors,  
  • no ancillas, no feedback, no exotic hardware.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose the following Pytheus target:

Collective Multiport Loop‐Parity Interferometer

1. Objective  
Design a single static linear-optical network (multiport interferometer) that takes as input L dual-rail photonic qubits (2L modes, one photon per qubit) and outputs a click pattern of 2L detectors which unambiguously signals the eigenvalue of the toric‐code loop operator  
   L = Z₁ Z₂ … Z_L  
(i.e. even vs. odd number of |1⟩’s among the L qubits) in one shot—no ancilla photons, no sequential swaps.

2. Conceptual Structure & Visualization  

  • Inputs:  
    – 2L spatial modes, arranged as pairs (mode i0, mode i1) encoding qubit i. Exactly one photon occupies each pair.  
  • Optical Network:  
    – A 2L×2L passive unitary U realized by beam-splitters and phase-shifters.  
    – U is optimized so that for any input bitstring b₁…b_L, all even-parity inputs route their photons into a designated “even” subset of output ports, and all odd-parity inputs route into the complementary “odd” subset.  
  • Detectors:  
    – 2L number‐resolving detectors at the output modes.  
    – The pattern of “which detectors click” reveals the overall parity.

    Outputs: [d0][d1]...[d5]

  Even‐parity inputs → detections in ports {d0,d1,d2};  
  Odd‐parity inputs → detections in ports {d3,d4,d5}.

  }

4. Area-Law Probe & Generalization  
  • By increasing L, one studies how the interferometer’s internal complexity (number of beam-splitter parameters) and success‐probability threshold scale with boundary length—an operational demonstration that measuring a larger loop “costs” more resources, mirroring an area law.  
  • Extend to multiple loops (e.g. two concentric loops) or higher-dimensional analogues (qutrit loops) to probe topological entanglement contributions.  
  • Compare multiport parity vs. naive chain-of-swaps designs to quantify resource compression or overhead.

Why This Is Exciting  
  • First passive linear-optical realization of an arbitrary-length toric-code loop operator in one static module.  
  • Translates area‐law entanglement into concrete interferometer‐complexity scaling.  
  • Entirely within Pytheus’s capabilities: beam-splitters, phase-shifters, no ancillas, static network, number-resolving detectors—no forbidden state generation or feedback.  
  • Yields a family of scalable experiments (vary L) and a direct bridge between topological‐order physics and photonic network design.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “multiport loop‐parity interferometer” is nothing more than a big passive unitary that sorts even‐ vs. odd‐parity basis strings into different output ports—i.e. it does exactly what you could do by measuring each qubit in Z and classically XORing the results. It introduces no genuinely new quantum resource (no nonlocal entangling measurement, no ancilla‐enabled nondemolition check beyond local Z), and offers no advantage or novelty over trivial local parity computation.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme reduces the nonlocal toric‐code loop measurement to a classical sorting of basis states via a permutation circuit, equivalent to measuring each qubit in Z and computing parity afterward. To be novel, you must propose a true nondestructive or entangling‐measurement primitive that cannot be replaced by local projective readout plus classical post‐processing.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm 3 Pytheus-compatible ways to link “toric code” and “area‐law entanglement” without state generation:
 1) Single-plaquette Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ analyzer by entanglement-swapping (already known).  
 2) Coherent 4-qubit parity-phase gate (parity-phase also explored).  
 3) Multi-plaquette stabilizer analyzer: measure the Z-stabilizers of a whole connected patch of n plaquettes in one static linear-optical circuit, using fewer ancillas than n separate analyzers—extracting a resource‐“area law” (ancilla count ∝ boundary length, not volume).

Step 2: Check novelty & feasibility:
 – Option 3 is genuinely new: no prior Pytheus experiment designs a single module to measure multiple overlapping plaquette operators at once.  
 – It’s purely a measurement network (analyzer) task, no forbidden state generation.  
 – Uses only beam-splitters, phase-shifters, probabilistic photon-pair sources or single-photon emitters, ancilla photons and post-selected detectors (all Pytheus can optimize).  
 – No feedback, no cavities, no hyper-entanglement.

Step 3: Choose Option 3.

Step 4: This idea is novel because it turns the toric-code “area law” (entanglement ∝ boundary length) into an operational question—“How many ancilla photons are needed to measure all Z-plaquette stabilizers in one go?”—and asks Pytheus to find a circuit reusing ancillas across adjacent plaquettes, demonstrating ancilla savings ∝ the patch perimeter.

Step 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework and satisfies all constraints because it requires only a single static interferometer connecting patch qubits to ancilla modes, with number-resolving detectors; no dynamic feedback or exotic hardware is needed, and the module generalizes to any patch shape/size for a whole family of experiments.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
I propose the following target for Pytheus:

Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling

1. Objective  
Design a single static linear-optical circuit that simultaneously measures the Z-stabilizers of all n plaquettes in a connected toric-patch of qubits. Rather than running n separate 4-qubit parity analyzers (each needing its own ancillas), Pytheus should find a network that shares ancilla photons across adjacent plaquettes so that the total number of ancilla detectors/photons scales with the patch perimeter (boundary length) L rather than the area n.

2. Conceptual Layout & Visualization  

  • Qubits:  Each toric-patch plaquette i has four corner qubits Q_{i1}…Q_{i4}. Adjacent plaquettes share two qubits on their common edge.  
  • Ancillas:  A pool of auxiliary photons from pair sources (or single-photon emitters).  
  • Optical Network:  
     – Beam-splitters and phase-shifters couple each shared qubit into one or two ancilla modes that fan out to the two neighboring plaquette measurements.  
     – A total of n measurement “blocks” (one per plaquette) overlap in ancilla space so that a single ancilla photon can serve two adjacent blocks.  
     – At the bottom, ancilla detectors herald whether each plaquette’s Z₁Z₂Z₃Z₄ = +1 or –1.  
  • Detectors:  
     – N_anc herald detectors (to be minimized) whose click signature yields the syndrome bits (s_i = ±1 for each plaquette).  

  Rough ASCII sketch for a 2×1 region (n=2, L=6 qubits, 2 plaquettes sharing 2 qubits):

    Q1──┐              ┌──Q4

      [BS/PS network]      ← shared ancilla paths  
         /            \

   samples: 30,  
   thresholds: [0.2, 0.1]  
 }

4. Area-Law Probe & Extensions  
 • Vary patch geometry (n plaquettes) and measure minimal num_anc vs. boundary length L. A linear fit num_anc ∝ L confirms an operational “area law” for measurement resources.  
 • Extend to measure mixed regions (holes) or two disjoint regions to probe topological entanglement features.  
 • Generalize to X-stabilizers or higher-dimensional toric codes (qutrit plaquettes).

Why This Is Exciting  
 • First demonstration of a shared-ancilla, multi-plaquette toric‐code stabilizer analyzer—turning topological code measurement into a resource‐scaling question.  
 • Directly links toric‐code boundary length with ancilla‐photon resources, an experimental analogue of the entanglement area law.  
 • Fully within Pytheus’s capabilities: linear optics, pair sources, ancilla detectors, static network—no forbidden state generation or dynamic feedback.  
 • Yields a scalable family of experiments (vary n, geometry) with rich applications in topological quantum networks and resource‐efficient syndrome extraction.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal goes beyond the single-plaquette parity check already in the literature by asking for a genuinely collective “multi-plaquette” stabilizer readout whose ancilla usage scales only with the patch boundary, not its area. None of the ensemble’s suggestions share ancillas across overlapping plaquette measurements or treat boundary-scaling as an operational area-law witness. This is a novel linear-optical primitive that could not be reduced to separate, independent parity checks and merits further study.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: The shared-ancilla multi-plaquette Z-stabilizer analyzer is a fundamentally new Pytheus target—simultaneously measuring an entire patch’s syndrome with ancilla resources ∝ perimeter. This collective, resource-efficient boundary-scaling measurement has not appeared in prior proposals and opens a new class of topological-order experiments.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title:  
Boundary-Scaling Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer for Toric-Code Patches  

Mini-Abstract:  
We propose a static linear-optical circuit—the Multi-Plaquette Z-Stabilizer Analyzer with Boundary-Scaling—that simultaneously measures all four-body Z stabilizers of an arbitrary connected toric-code plaquette patch using a shared pool of ancilla photons, such that the total ancilla detectors (or photons) scale with the patch’s perimeter rather than its area.  By employing Pythues to optimize beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors, our design operationally realizes an “area law” for entanglement resources in topological syndrome extraction without forbidden state preparation or dynamic feedback.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal targets a multi-qubit measurement task—rather than state generation—by building a single static linear‐optical network to read out many toric‐code Z‐stabilizers at once, reusing ancilla photons so that the overhead grows only with the boundary rather than the area. Such a parity‐check measurement is in principle implementable with number‐resolving detectors, beam splitters and phase shifts, and PyTheus is well suited to optimize precisely this kind of multi‐mode interferometer. The idea is novel, plausible, and falls squarely within PyTheus’s measurement‐design capabilities.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This is a creative and well‐posed application of PyTheus to design a static linear‐optical syndrome extractor whose ancilla overhead scales with the patch boundary. The physics—measuring multi‐photon Z‐parities via interference and number‐resolution—fits current lab techniques, and the resource scaling claim is both interesting and feasible for the tool’s optimization.
