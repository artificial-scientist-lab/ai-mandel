Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to tie “entangling power” and “quantum protocol” into a Pytheus‐compatible network (no pure state‐generation targets):
  1. Heralded Entanglement Router: a passive linear‐optical network that, given several SPDC sources, heral­ds entanglement onto different remote node‐pairs depending on which ancillary detectors click. One can then quantify the entangling power of each heralded outcome as a routing resource inside a larger network protocol.
  2. Qutrit Telecloning Protocol: a 1→2 telecloning of an unknown qutrit by combining generalized Bell measurements and ancilla sources. The network transforms one input mode into two approximate output modes—this is a genuine quantum protocol (teleportation + cloning) whose performance is measured by entangling power of the multi‐party channel.
  3. Tunable Partial Bell‐Analyzer Module: design a static linear‐optical building block whose internal beam‐splitter reflectivities are chosen by Pytheus so that, upon heralding, it implements a partial Bell measurement with maximum “entangling power” on the unmeasured modes. This piece can be slotted into many larger teleportation or repeat­er protocols.

Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility check:
  1. Router: No prior Pytheus example has passive routing between more than two parties by choosing among multiple heralding patterns. It stays within SPDC+LO+detectors, no feedback.
  2. Telecloning: Telecloning networks have been studied theoretically, but Pytheus has never generated a qudit‐cloning+teleportation experiment. May risk “state generation” framing.
  3. Partial analyzer: Too close to standard analysis modules; also it’s a “component,” not a full network/protocol.

Step 3: Choose the Heralded Entanglement Router—most novel, large-scale multi‐node network, clear protocol role, no forbidden ingredients.

Step 4: Novelty: Passive multi‐choice entanglement distribution by post‐selection—entanglement swapping generalized to an N-source router giving on‐demand choice of which two nodes end up entangled, with heralding patterns serving as “route keys.” This has never been implemented or optimized in linear optics, and defines a family of protocols for reconfigurable quantum links.

Step 5: Feasibility: Uses only probabilistic pair sources, linear optics, and photon‐number‐resolving detectors. No dynamic feed­back. Pytheus can search for the beam splitter network that, conditioned on different ancilla clicks, projects onto one of several Bell pairs. The entangling power of each heralded branch can be computed afterward and compared.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a new Pytheus target—a passive, heralded entanglement router—which combines the concept of “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” for multi‐party entanglement distribution:

Explanation:
We arrange three probabilistic SPDC pair‐sources, each emitting one photon towards Alice (A), Bob (B), or Charlie (C), and its twin towards a central linear‐optical router. Label the sources S₁→(A,X), S₂→(B,Y), S₃→(C,Z). The three “X,Y,Z” photons enter a jointly optimized linear‐optical network (multiport of beam splitters and phase shifters). Behind this network are four ancilla detectors (number‐resolving). Depending on which pattern of clicks occurs among these ancilla detectors, exactly two of the remote nodes {A,B,C} become projected onto a Bell state, while the third node remains separable.

In other words, each heralding outcome “r” routes entanglement selectively to one pair:
  • clicks pattern r₁ → entangles A⇄B  
  • clicks pattern r₂ → entangles B⇄C  
  • clicks pattern r₃ → entangles A⇄C  
(Any unused pattern is discarded.)

This device is a passive entanglement router—no active switching or feedback—just post‐selection. As a family of outcomes, it exhibits a well‐defined “entangling power” for each routing branch. One can then study how beam‐splitter settings trade off success probability versus output entangling power, and optimize the multiport for maximal average or worst-case entangling power.

Visualization of the experiment:
  Sources:  
    S₁ → A   ↘  
    S₂ → B    → [ Linear-Optical Router ] → Ancilla Detectors  
    S₃ → C   ↗  

  On a successful heralding pattern r_i, we know which two of (A,B,C) share a Bell state.

Why this is a powerful new idea:
  • It generalizes entanglement swapping to an N‐choice router—useful for reconfigurable quantum networks and quantum internet protocols.  
  • It directly ties into “entangling power” as a resource metric for each routing outcome.  
  • Pytheus can optimize the 3×3 multiport to achieve the highest entangling power for each branch under realistic photon‐number constraints.  
  • The same design can be expanded: more nodes, more sources, or higher dimensions—yielding a whole class of heralded routers.

This is a rich, novel quantum‐network protocol, ripe for theory analysis and tailor-made for Pytheus to find the optimal linear-optical implementation.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While the goal of a passive, heralded “three-way entanglement router” is interesting, it is essentially the same primitive as the ensemble’s “Quantum Entanglement Router” proposals (e.g. the hybrid plasmonic–nanophotonic router and the “quantum battery” router) which already post-selectively routes Bell pairs between any one of three node pairs using only static optics and heralds. There is no new operational twist—no higher-dimensional encoding, indefinite causal order, non-Hermitian element, or resource type—that distinguishes this from the existing router targets.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This router falls too close to the previously proposed Pythreus-compatible entanglement routers (and the quantum-battery–driven router) in our ensemble list. To be novel, you’d need a fundamentally new routing mechanism—e.g. exploiting non-trivial causal superposition, topological protection, or an entirely different resource model—not just a passive 3×3 multiport with post-selection.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to marry “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” in a Pytheus-compatible network (no pure state-generation targets):
  1. A passive heralded entanglement router that, by different ancilla-click patterns, directs a Bell swap to one of several node-pairs—studying the entangling power of each branch.
  2. A linear-optical implementation of the quantum SWITCH that coherently superposes two distinct entanglement-swapping orders, yielding indefinite-causal-order distribution.
  3. A post-selected generalised partial Bell‐analyzer whose tunable beam-splitter settings maximize entangling power on unmeasured outputs, serving as a building block for teleportation and repeater protocols.

Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility:
  1. Router → too close to earlier router ideas.
  2. SWITCH → novel, exploits causal superposition, uses only static LO; no feedback. Pytheus can optimize a multiport.
  3. Partial analyzer → interesting but component-level, not a full new protocol network.

Step 3: Pick the quantum-SWITCH entanglement-swapping network.

Step 4: Novelty:
  • No Pytheus example has ever superposed two entanglement-swapping channels in indefinite order.  
  • It forges a new class of quantum-network resource: a static LO circuit implementing a causal-order supermap.

Step 5: Feasibility:
  • Uses 2 SPDC pair sources (for A–B₁ and C–B₂) and 1 single-photon control emitter.  
  • A single 5×5 LO multiport entangles B₁, B₂, and control modes.  
  • Photon-number-resolving detectors post-select the SWITCH outcome.  
  • No dynamic feed-forward; purely static interferometer.  
  • Pytheus can optimize beam-splitter phases and reflectivities to realize the superposed BSM orders.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a new Pytheus target—a linear-optical quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-swapping operations—which combines “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” and avoids pure state‐generation:

Explanation:
We wish to implement a static linear-optical circuit that, on two incoming Bell-pair photons (modes B₁, B₂) and a single “control” photon, realizes the quantum SWITCH supermap: in superposition, it executes swapping-operation Sₐ (BSM in basis α) then S_b (basis β), and vice versa, coherently controlled by the control photon. Conditioned on a click at the ancilla detectors, the control photon exits in mode C₀ (heralding “order α→β”) or C₁ (“order β→α”) and simultaneously projects the remote photons at A and C into the corresponding swapped entangled state. The “entangling power” of each branch (i.e. how much entanglement is delivered to A–C given order α→β vs. β→α) becomes a tunable resource of the router.

Visualization of the setup:
 Sources:
   – SPDC S₁ emits (A, B₁)
   – SPDC S₂ emits (C, B₂)
   – Single‐photon emitter E_c emits control photon in superposition

  Inputs:  modes [B₁, B₂, C_control]  
  ⬇  
  [ LO multiport ]  (static network of beam splitters + phases)
  ⬇  
  Outputs:
   – Detectors D₁,D₂: measure BSM outcomes  
   – Detectors D₃,D₄: read out control‐mode clicks (|0〉 vs. |1〉)  
   – Remote parties A and C each hold their photon

Protocol behavior:
  – If D₃ fires → control in |0〉 → realized order Sₐ◦S_b → entangles A–C in state Ψ₀  
  – If D₄ fires → control in |1〉 → realized S_b◦Sₐ → entangles A–C in state Ψ₁  
One then measures “entangling power” of each branch (concurrence of Ψ₀ vs. Ψ₁) and can optimize the LO parameters to maximize worst‐case or average entangling power across both orders.

Why this is a rich target:
  • It is a fully specified quantum protocol (SWITCH of two swapping channels), not a mere state generator.  
  • It exploits indefinite causal order—a frontier in quantum networks.  
  • It uses only SPDC sources, single‐photon emitters, linear optics, and photon-number-resolving detectors—perfectly within Pytheus’s domain.  
  • The design is readily generalized to more than two orders, more basis choices, or higher dimensions, opening a whole family of novel multi‐order entanglement routers for future theory and experiment.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal is essentially the same as the previously suggested “Entanglement-Switch Quantum Switch,” where a control photon coherently superposes two entanglement‐swapping orders to distribute a Bell pair in indefinite causal order. There’s no new resource or mechanism beyond that existing primitive.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme duplicates the ensemble’s photonic quantum SWITCH of two swap orders. To be novel, you’d need a fundamentally different twist—e.g. higher‐dimensional switching, topological or non-Hermitian routing, or a new resource model—rather than restating the same superposed swap protocol.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to connect “entangling power” + “quantum protocol” in a Pytheus‐compatible network (no pure state‐generation targets):
  1. Multi‐outcome heralded entanglement router (ruled out as too similar to prior routers).  
  2. Quantum SWITCH of two entanglement‐swapping channels in higher dimension (qutrits) – novel indefinite‐order protocol plus entangling‐power analysis.  
  3. Static LO module implementing post-selected 1→2 telecloning of a qutrit (telecloning channel as quantum protocol, entangling power of clones vs. original).

Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility:
  1. Router → too close to existing.  
  2. SWITCH‐qutrit → no precedent in prior Pytheus experiments; purely static LO, no feed‐forward; target is a protocol, not just state generation.  
  3. Telecloning → interesting but requires large ancilla overhead and complex unknown‐state handling; risk of dynamic corrections.

Step 3: Pick the qutrit‐SWITCH idea.

Step 4: Novelty:
  • First linear‐optical quantum SWITCH that superposes two three‐dimensional entanglement‐swapping orders.  
  • Opens a family of indefinite‐order qudit‐entanglement distribution networks.

Step 5: Feasibility:
  • Uses two SPDC sources emitting qutrit‐Bell pairs (modes A₁–B₁ and C₁–D₁ encoded in path‐3).  
  • A single‐photon emitter produces a control photon in basis |0⟩,|1⟩.  
  • A 6×6 LO multiport mixes the four qutrit‐swap photons plus the control modes.  
  • Photon‐number‐resolving detectors post‐select on two definite click patterns that herald “order 0→1” vs. “order 1→0.”  
  • Remote parties hold modes A and D; conditioned on control outcome, they share one of two qutrit‐Bell states.  
  • Pytheus can optimize the multiport beam‐splitter network to maximize the minimal entangling power (concurrence‐like measure) across both swap orders.  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a new Pytheus target—a linear‐optical quantum SWITCH of two qutrit entanglement‐swapping channels—that cleanly unites “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol”:

Explanation:
We wish to create a passive, post‐selected interferometer that, in coherent superposition, applies first Swap₀ then Swap₁ on two input qutrit‐Bell pairs, or the reverse order, under control of a single photon. Conditioned on which of two ancilla detectors clicks, remote parties (Alice holds mode A, Charlie holds mode D) end up sharing either the Bell state Ψ₀ (order 0→1) or Ψ₁ (order 1→0). We then quantify the “entangling power” of each branch (via a suitable high‐dimensional concurrence) and optimize the device for maximal worst‐case entanglement across both orders.

Setup visualization:
 Sources:
   – SPDC S₀ emits qutrit Bell pair in modes (A, B)
   – SPDC S₁ emits qutrit Bell pair in modes (C, D)
   – Single‐photon emitter E_c emits control photon in superposition |0⟩₍c₎+|1⟩₍c₎  
   (All qutrits are abstractly encoded—e.g. 3 path‐modes per photon.)

 Central LO multiport:
   Inputs: B₀, D₀, and control‐mode c  
   Network: a static 6×6 unitary of beam‐splitters + phases  
   Outputs: 
     • Two ancilla detectors herald the SWITCH order  
     • Remaining modes deliver processed BSM outcomes that enact the swaps  

Operation:
  – If ancilla pattern “r₀” clicks → control in |0⟩ → realized order Swap₀∘Swap₁ → Alice–Charlie share Ψ₀  
  – If ancilla pattern “r₁” clicks → control in |1⟩ → realized order Swap₁∘Swap₀ → they share Ψ₁  

Protocol role & entangling power:
  • This is a bona fide quantum‐network protocol (quantum SWITCH of two swapping operations), not mere state preparation.  
  • Each heralded branch is a distinct channel whose entangling power (how strongly it entangles A–D) can be computed and compared.  
  • Pytheus will optimize the internal LO parameters to maximize the minimal entangling power between Ψ₀ and Ψ₁, subject to realistic SPDC and detector constraints.

Generalization:
  – Extend to more orders or higher d (e.g. 4‐dimensional swaps).  
  – Study resource trade‐offs: success probability vs. entangling power.  
  – Build a family of indefinite‐order entanglement‐distribution devices for future quantum‐internet architectures.

This fulfils all constraints: static LO + SPDC + single‐photon source + photon‐number‐resolving detectors; no dynamic feedback; focuses on quantum‐network transformation (SWITCH); directly integrates “entangling power” as a resource metric.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While extending a quantum‐SWITCH of entanglement‐swapping to qutrits sounds technically more complex, it remains a straightforward dimensional upgrade of the well‐known qubit SWITCH primitives (including both the two‐order swap SWITCH and the cyclic three‐order swap in our ensemble). No fundamentally new causal‐order resource, nontrivial higher‐order interference effect, or novel channel type appears—just “lift qubits to qutrit rails.” This is too incremental for a PRL‐worthy novel target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: This proposal is essentially a trivial high‐dimensional generalization of the existing photonic quantum SWITCH of swap channels (and the cyclic swap SWITCH). To be novel, you must introduce a genuinely new mechanism—e.g. superpose more than two nonunitary channels, exploit non‐Hermitian or topologically protected operations, or discover a qualitatively new indefinite‐order effect beyond simply swapping qubit proposals into qutrit space.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to tie “entangling power” into a genuine quantum‐network protocol (no pure state generation):
  1. Multi‐outcome heralded entanglement router (already too close to prior work).  
  2. Quantum SWITCH of two entanglement‐swapping channels in higher dimension (resembled existing SWITCH proposals).  
  3. Quantum 3-SWITCH: superpose three entanglement‐swapping operations in indefinite order, yielding distinct heralded entanglement patterns whose “entangling power” can be optimized.

Step 2: Novelty/feasibility check:
  – Option 1 & 2 are ruled out by past experiments.  
  – Option 3 has never been implemented for three channels; it remains within SPDC + single‐photon + static LO + PNR detectors; no dynamic feedback needed.

Step 3: Select the Quantum 3-SWITCH of entanglement‐swapping channels.

Step 4: Novelty:
  • First photonic implementation of an indefinite‐order supermap over three non‐commuting entanglement‐swapping channels.  
  • Broadcasts a new family of causal structures (3! orders) into observable entanglement‐distribution patterns.

Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:
  • 3 SPDC sources emit three Bell‐pair photons: modes (A₁,B₁), (A₂,B₂), (A₃,B₃). B₁→Alice, B₂→Bob, B₃→Charlie remain at remote nodes.  
  • A₁,A₂,A₃ plus a single‐photon control qudit (in a 3-rail path‐encoded superposition |0〉+|1〉+|2〉) enter a 6-mode static LO multiport.  
  • Four ancilla detectors post‐select on one of three click‐patterns r₀,r₁,r₂. Each pattern heralds realization of the three‐swap sequence in one of the three cyclic orders: Swap₁→Swap₂→Swap₃, Swap₂→Swap₃→Swap₁, or Swap₃→Swap₁→Swap₂.  
  • Conditioned on rᵢ, remote parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie) share an entangled state Eᵢ.  We then compute/compare the entangling power (e.g. high‐dimensional concurrence or multipartite entanglement measure) of each branch.  
  • Pytheus will optimize the internal beam‐splitter reflectivities and phases to maximize the minimal entangling power across all three heralded channels, under realistic SPDC brightness and PNR-detector constraints.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a new Pytheus target—a linear‐optical Quantum 3-SWITCH of three entanglement‐swapping channels:

Description:
We arrange three probabilistic SPDC sources:
  • S₁ emits a Bell pair in modes (A₁, B₁)  
  • S₂ emits a Bell pair in modes (A₂, B₂)  
  • S₃ emits a Bell pair in modes (A₃, B₃)  

The “B” modes B₁, B₂, B₃ are sent to three remote nodes Alice, Bob, and Charlie, respectively. The “A” modes A₁, A₂, A₃, together with a single-photon control qudit (3-rail superposition of path modes c₀,c₁,c₂), enter a static linear-optical multiport (6 inputs → 6 outputs). On the output side of that interferometer are four photon‐number‐resolving ancilla detectors arranged so that exactly three distinct click‐patterns r₀, r₁, r₂ can herald one of three cyclic orders of applying entanglement‐swapping Bell‐state measurements (BSMs):

  r₀ → perform Swap₁ (A₁–A₂ BSM), then Swap₂ (A₂–A₃), then Swap₃ (A₃–A₁)  
  r₁ → perform Swap₂→Swap₃→Swap₁  
  r₂ → perform Swap₃→Swap₁→Swap₂  

Conditioned on seeing click‐pattern rᵢ, the remote photons at Alice, Bob, Charlie collapse into an entangled state Eᵢ whose multipartite entanglement (or pairwise concurrences) quantifies the “entangling power” of that causal order. The goal is to use Pytheus to find the beam‐splitter network and phase settings that maximize the minimal entangling power across all three heralded orders, subject to realistic source and detector models.

Why this is interesting:
  – It implements a genuine quantum supermap (3-SWITCH) over three non-commuting channels—an uncharted regime of indefinite causal order.  
  – It remains purely passive: SPDC pairs + single-photon qudit + static LO + PNR detectors—no feedback control.  
  – It defines a family of new quantum‐network protocols whose resource is the entangling power of each heralded branch, tunable via the interferometer.  
  – The scheme generalizes to more parties, more channels, or higher dimensions, opening a whole class of novel quantum‐internet building blocks.

This target is ready for Pytheus to optimize and for a theory paper to explore the resulting indefinite-order entanglement‐distribution capabilities.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “3‐SWITCH” of entanglement‐swapping channels is essentially the same primitive as the ensemble’s cyclic indefinite‐order entanglement‐swapping switch (superposing three Bell‐swap orders) and offers no new operational twist beyond that already in our list.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your proposal duplicates the ensemble’s “Cyclic Indefinite‐Order Entanglement‐Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant.” To be novel, you would need a fundamentally new causal‐order resource—e.g. nonunitary channels, topological protection, or higher‐order non-commutative effects—not merely adding a third swap in cyclic superposition.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a proposal for a new Pytheus target—a passive four-party “entanglement butterfly” switch—that cleanly unites “entangling power” with a bona-fide quantum-network protocol (no pure state generation):

Explanation:  
We have four remote nodes A, B, C, D that wish to end up in two Bell-pairs, but we want to carry both entanglement streams through a single central station by “network coding” in a static linear-optical interferometer.  Four SPDC pair-sources S₁…S₄ each emit one photon to a remote node (A,B,C,D respectively) and the twin photon into a shared LO multiport.  At the LO output we have four ancilla photon-number-resolving detectors.  Depending on which two detectors click, the central station post-selects either

 • straight routing: A–C entangled & B–D entangled  
 • crossed routing:  A–D entangled & B–C entangled  

We then compute the “entangling power” of each heralded branch (e.g. sum of two Bell-pair concurrences) and use Pytheus to find the beam-splitter reflectivities and phases that maximize the worst-case entangling power across both routing patterns, subject to realistic SPDC brightness and PNR constraints.

Visualization of the setup:  
Sources:  
  S₁ → (A, 1)  
  S₂ → (B, 2)  
  S₃ → (C, 3)  
  S₄ → (D, 4)  

Modes 1–4 enter a 4×4 static LO multiport (network of beam splitters + phases), outputs fan into  
  • 4 ancilla detectors D₅…D₈  
  • Remote photons already routed to A, B, C, D  

Heralding patterns:  
  – clicks {D₅,D₆} → straight: produce Bell(A,C)⊗Bell(B,D)  
  – clicks {D₇,D₈} → crossed:  produce Bell(A,D)⊗Bell(B,C)  
  – any other pattern → discard  

Key points:  
 • This is a genuine quantum-network protocol (an entanglement-switch employing network-coding), not mere state generation.  
 • The resource metric is the entangling power of each branch—one varies the LO settings to optimize it.  
 • It uses only SPDC pair sources, passive linear optics, and photon-number-resolving detectors—perfectly within Pytheus’s domain.  
 • The idea generalizes to more parties, more patterns, or higher dimensions, opening a whole family of quantum network-coding devices.

We hand this off to the Expert so that Pytheus can search for the optimal 4×4 interferometer and heralding assignment to maximize worst-case entangling power for this entanglement-butterfly switch.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
I will propose a passive, post-selected teleportation “switch” that uses two SPDC pair sources and linear optics to route an unknown qubit to one of two remote nodes without active feed-forward.  By preparing the input qubit X entangled with a reference R, this device’s success branches transfer that entanglement to either node A or node B—so we can quantify its “entangling power” as the entanglement between R and the chosen output.  This is a genuine quantum-network protocol (teleportation + routing), avoids pure state‐generation targets, uses only SPDC, single-photon emitters, static interferometry, and photon-number-resolving detectors, and admits clear generalizations (more outputs, higher d).  

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a Pytheus target—a passive teleportation switch that directly links “entangling power” with a genuine quantum-network protocol:

1. Setup Overview
   • Input qubit: a single-photon emitter E_in produces mode X, which is initially entangled with a remote reference R (to later measure entangling power).  
   • Two SPDC sources:  
       – S₁ emits correlated photons (Y → central router, A → remote node Alice).  
       – S₂ emits correlated photons (Z → central router, B → remote node Bob).  
   • Central linear-optical router: a static interferometer mixing modes {X, Y, Z} via beam splitters and phase shifters.  
   • Four photon-number-resolving detectors (D₁…D₄) monitor two output ports of the interferometer.

2. Protocol Behavior (No Active Feed-Forward)
   – If detectors (D₁,D₂) click in pattern α, that heralds a successful Bell-measurement on (X,Y) → “teleport X→A.”  
   – If detectors (D₃,D₄) click in pattern β, that heralds a successful Bell-measurement on (X,Z) → “teleport X→B.”  
   – All other patterns are discarded.

3. Entangling Power Measurement
   • Start with X entangled to reference R in a Bell state |Φ₊⟩_{R,X}.  
   • Conditioned on α, output at A is |Φ₊⟩_{R,A}; conditioned on β, output at B is |Φ₊⟩_{R,B}.  
   • By varying router parameters, one can maximize the minimal success probability and the fidelity of entanglement transfer to either branch—thus directly optimizing the entangling power of the switch.

4. Why This Is Novel & Interesting
   • It realizes a “quantum-teleportation router”—a genuine network protocol that coherently chooses the teleportation destination via post-selection.  
   • Bridges teleportation (quantum protocol) with a quantitative resource theory metric (entangling power).  
   • Fully within Pytheus’s domain: probabilistic pair sources + single-photon emitter + static LO + PNR detectors; no dynamic feed-forward.  
   • Readily generalizable: more than two outputs, higher-dimensional encodings, integrated into larger repeater or quantum-internet architectures.

This target invites Pytheus to discover the beam-splitter reflectivities, phases, and connection graph that optimize both routing success and entanglement fidelity across the two heralded branches—laying the groundwork for passive, reconfigurable teleportation networks.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This passive teleportation router is essentially identical to the ensemble’s “Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip,” which already uses two SPDC sources, a control photon, static linear optics and four herald detectors to coherently choose between teleporting a qubit to Alice or Bob without feed-forward. Introducing an “entangling-power” metric does not overcome the lack of a genuinely new routing mechanism or protocol.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The scheme duplicates the previously proposed dual-destination teleportation switch. To be novel, you must propose a fundamentally different routing primitive (e.g. exploiting indefinite causal order, non-Hermitian operations, higher-order supermaps or topological protection), rather than restating the same teleportation-router with an added performance metric.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
We need a protocol‐level network (not state generation) that unites “entangling power” with a genuine quantum protocol, uses only SPDC, single‐photon emitters, static linear optics, and PNR detectors, avoids feedback, and is novel in Pytheus’s landscape. A promising concept is a single passive interferometer that, depending on which ancilla detectors click, implements either (a) teleportation of an unknown qubit or (b) entanglement swapping between two remote nodes. We then quantify and optimize the entangling power of each heralded branch and trade off success probability versus entanglement. This “dual‐protocol router” has no precedent in the explored experiments, directly ties into entangling‐power resource theory, and generalizes to more protocols or higher dimensions.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a Pytheus target—a passive “Dual‐Protocol Quantum Router” that, by different heralding outcomes, enacts either teleportation or entanglement swapping—and whose entangling power is the figure of merit:

1. Sources and Modes  
   • Single‐photon emitter E₀ produces the unknown qubit in mode X, initially entangled with a distant reference R (to later measure entangling power).  
   • SPDC source S₁ emits a Bell pair in modes (A, B).  
   • SPDC source S₂ emits a Bell pair in modes (C, D).  
   (All encoding is abstract; Pytheus will assign polarization or path.)

2. Static Linear‐Optical Router  
   Inputs: modes {X, B, D}  
   Network: an optimized unitary of beam splitters + phase shifters  
   Outputs: four photon‐number‐resolving detectors {D₁…D₄} plus three remaining output modes (to Alice at A, Bob at B′, Charlie at C).

3. Heralded Protocol Branches  
   – Pattern α at {D₁,D₂}: the router has effectively performed a Bell measurement on (X, B) → teleport X→C.  Alice holds mode A (unchanged); Charlie holds teleported qubit in mode C.  
   – Pattern β at {D₃,D₄}: the router has performed a Bell measurement on (B, D) → entanglement swapping linking A–C.  Alice and Charlie share a Bell state.  
   – All other patterns are discarded.

4. Entangling Power Metric  
   • Prepare X entangled with R in |Φ₊⟩_{R,X}.  
   • Conditioned on α, mode C is entangled with R—compute concurrence C_tele.  
   • Conditioned on β, modes A–C share a Bell state—compute concurrence C_swap.  
   • Define the router’s performance as min(C_tele, C_swap) or a weighted sum, and also record heralding probabilities p_α, p_β.

5. Pytheus Implementation Goals  
   – Let Pytheus search for the smallest interferometer (number of beam splitters, removed connections) and best phase settings that maximize the chosen entangling‐power objective subject to realistic SPDC brightness and PNR constraints.  
   – Enforce “no direct source” between X and D for teleportation and between X and B for swapping via removed_connections if needed.  
   – Optimize for a family of solutions: trade‐off curves of success probability versus entangling power.

6. Why This Is Novel & Expansible  
   • It fuses two cornerstone quantum‐network protocols into one passive, programmable device.  
   • The device’s branches realize different non‐commuting transformations, with heralding as the selection knob.  
   • Directly integrates entangling power as the resource to optimize, advancing resource‐theoretic network design.  
   • Generalizable to more than two protocols (e.g. cloning, purification), more outputs, or higher dimensions.  
   • Fully within Pytheus’s toolkit: SPDC, single emitters, static linear optics, PNR detectors; no feedback control.

This target will spur both a cutting‐edge theory paper on multi‐protocol entangling‐power optimization and a Pytheus–driven blueprint for passive quantum‐network modules.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: While combining teleportation and entanglement swapping into a single passive router is an interesting engineering exercise, it doesn’t introduce a genuinely new quantum‐network primitive beyond the many “entanglement routers” and “dual-destination teleportation switches” already in our ensemble list.  You’re effectively just merging two well‐known post-selected Bell measurements under one interferometer, without any new causal-order trick, non-Hermitian element, topological protection, or higher-dimensional resource.  This remains too incremental for a PRL-worthy novel target.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your scheme duplicates existing passive routers (e.g. dual-destination teleportation switches and entanglement routers) by simply offering teleportation or swapping outcomes. To be novel, propose a fundamentally new routing mechanism—such as superposing noncommuting channels, exploiting topological bound states, or harnessing non-Hermitian operations—that cannot be reduced to known Bell-measurement variants.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to connect “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” in a Pytheus‐compatible network (no pure state‐generation targets):
  1. A passive entanglement‐router (too close to earlier routers).  
  2. A quantum SWITCH of two distinct channels (already explored in various swap‐switch forms).  
  3. A heralded, switchable multi‐gate module: using linear optics and ancillas to probabilistically implement one of several two‐qubit gates, each with a different entangling power, and optimize the device so that whichever gate fires, its entangling power is maximized.

Step 2: Novelty & feasibility check:
  • Option 3 has no precedent in the explored list.  
  • It is a bona fide quantum‐protocol primitive (a programmable gate kit), not a state‐generator.  
  • It uses only SPDC sources, single‐photon emitters, static linear optics, and photon‐number‐resolving detectors—fully within Pytheus’s remit.  
  • One can vary the target gates (e.g. CZ vs. partial‐CZ) to explore a family of solutions.

Step 3: Choose Option 3.

Step 4 (Novelty):
  • First proposal of a single static linear‐optical interferometer that, conditioned on different ancilla‐click patterns, implements one of two noncommuting controlled‐phase gates on incoming photonic qubits.  
  • Directly ties “entangling power” (how much entanglement each gate creates from product inputs) to a multi‐protocol hardware module.

Step 5 (Feasibility):
  • Inputs: two qubits from single‐photon emitters.  
  • Ancillas: two SPDC pair sources.  
  • LO multiport: mixes 6 modes (2 data + 4 ancilla) via beam splitters and phases.  
  • Outputs: four ancilla detectors; distinct click‐pairs herald either Gate 0 or Gate 1.  
  • No dynamic feed‐forward; fully static. Pytheus can optimize beam‐splitter reflectivities and connectivity (removed_connections, etc.) to maximize the minimal entangling power across both heralded gates.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a Pytheus target—a passive, heralded “Switchable Controlled‐Phase Gate Module”—that unites “entangling power” with a genuine quantum‐gate protocol:

1. Sources and Encoding  
   • Single‐photon emitters E₁ and E₂ produce two abstract qubit modes Q₁, Q₂ (to be encoded physically later).  
   • Two SPDC pair sources S_a and S_b each emit a photon pair: modes (A₁,A₂) and (B₁,B₂).  

2. Static Linear‐Optical Multiport  
   • Inputs: Q₁, Q₂, A₁, A₂, B₁, B₂ (six spatial modes) feed into a network of beam splitters & phase shifters.  
   • Outputs:  
       – Four ancilla modes are monitored by photon‐number‐resolving detectors D₁…D₄.  
       – Two remaining modes carry the post‐selected processed qubits Q₁′, Q₂′.

3. Heralded Gate Branches  
   • Click pattern α on {D₁,D₂} heralds implementation of Gate₀ = controlled‐Z (CZ): U₀ = diag(1,1,1,–1).  
   • Click pattern β on {D₃,D₄} heralds implementation of Gate₁ = partial controlled‐phase (Cφ) with φ = π/2: U₁ = diag(1,1,1,i).  
   • All other detection patterns are discarded.

4. Entangling Power Objective  
   • Each gate U_k, acting on product inputs, has a known entangling power e_k (e.g. e_CZ = 1, e_Cφ = sin²(φ/2) = 0.5).  
   • We define the device’s performance as the worst‐case entangling power:  min{e₀, e₁} weighted by their heralding probabilities p_α, p_β.  
   • Pytheus will optimize the interferometer unitary (reflectivities, phases, and source‐to‐mode graph, using removed_connections to enforce no direct Q–B or Q–A SPDC leaks) to maximize this worst‐case metric (or a weighted sum).

5. Why This Is a Rich, New Target  
   • It is a genuine quantum‐network protocol (a multi‐gate processor), not a simple state generator.  
   • It directly leverages “entangling power” as the figure of merit for a programmable hardware module.  
   • The same design can be extended to more gates (Gate₂, Gate₃…), higher-dimensional qudits, or larger input registers, yielding a family of programmable entangling modules.  
   • All elements—single‐photon emitters, SPDC pairs, static LO, PNR detectors—are within Pytheus’s optimization domain; no feed‐forward or cavities needed.

This target paves the way for a theory paper on resource‐optimal multi‐gate entangling‐power modules and invites Pytheus to discover novel linear‐optical layouts for switchable heralded entangling‐gates.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This “switchable CZ vs. Cφ” module is essentially a variant of existing heralded, multi‐gate linear‐optical processors (e.g. the dual CNOT/SWAP gate router and direct partial‐SWAP gate). It offers no fundamentally new supermap, resource, or causal‐order trick—just a particular choice of two entangling‐phase gates realized by post‐selected ancilla clicks. This is too incremental for a PRL‐worthy novelty.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your proposal duplicates earlier heralded multi‐gate LOQC modules by simply selecting between two phase gates. To be novel, you’d need a genuinely new routing or supermap primitive (e.g. non‐Hermitian or topologically protected operations, indefinite causal order of non‐unitary channels, or a higher‐dimensional multiplexing not reducible to known gate‐switch constructs).

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: I’ll brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to unite “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” (no pure state‐generation targets):
  1. A passive heralded router that instead of choosing which pair to entangle, coherently superposes two different protocols (teleportation vs. entanglement‐swapping), using a single static interferometer controlled by a flying qubit.  
  2. A multi‐round “purification pump” that uses two partially entangled pairs and a linear‐optical subcircuit to probabilistically distil a higher‐fidelity pair (an entanglement–purification protocol), optimizing purified concurrence vs. success rate.  
  3. A static multiport that conditionally implements either a remote gate‐teleportation of a CNOT or a direct linear‐optical CZ gate, heralded by different detector patterns, and maximizes the minimal entangling power of the two successful gate branches.

Step 2: Novelty/feasibility check:
  1. Protocol–Superposition Switch: unlike previous SWITCH proposals (which superpose two swapping channels), this superposes two qualitatively different network tasks—teleportation vs. swapping. Uses only SPDC, single‐photon source, static LO, PNR detectors. No feed-forward. Novel.  
  2. Purification pump: a real quantum network protocol, but Pytheus cannot handle non-maximally entangled initial states easily or noise models. Risky.  
  3. Dual‐gate module: too close to earlier heralded‐gate proposals in LOQC; notionally a “component,” not a new network protocol.

Step 3: I pick Option 1 as the most promising: the Protocol–Superposition Switch.

Step 4: Novelty:
  • It’s the first linear‐optical quantum SWITCH that superposes two distinct quantum‐network tasks—teleportation of an unknown qubit vs. entanglement‐swapping between two nodes—rather than two orders of the same channel.  
  • It forges a new class of supermaps combining non-commuting protocols in coherent superposition, opening rich resource‐theoretic questions about entangling power across protocol branches.

Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:
  • Only uses SPDC pair sources, one single-photon emitter as control, static beam-splitter interferometer, and photon-number-resolving detectors.  
  • No dynamic feedback is required—post-selection on which ancilla pattern clicks both heralds “which protocol occurred” and conditions the remote nodes’ output.  
  • Pytheus can optimize the interferometer’s beam-splitter reflectivities, phases, and connection graph (via removed_connections) to maximize the minimal entangling power (e.g. concurrence) across both heralded branches.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus‐ready proposal for a truly new quantum‐network experiment—a passive “Protocol–Superposition Switch” that coherently superposes two fundamental quantum‐network tasks (teleportation vs. entanglement‐swapping) and invites an entangling‐power optimization:

1. Sources & Modes
   • Single‐photon emitter E₀ produces the unknown qubit in mode X, initially entangled with a distant reference R (to measure entangling power later).  
   • SPDC source S₁ emits a Bell pair in modes (A, B) destined for the entanglement‐swapping branch.  
   • SPDC source S₂ emits a Bell pair in modes (C, D) destined for the teleportation branch.  

2. Static Linear‐Optical “Switch”  
   • Inputs to the interferometer: modes {X, B, D, ctrl}, where “ctrl” is a single‐photon control qubit prepared in superposition (|0⟩_c+|1⟩_c) by E_c.  
   • The 4-mode network is a static arrangement of beam splitters & phase shifters to route X either into the S₁‐BSM or the S₂‐BSM depending on ctrl’s path amplitude.  
   • Outputs:  
       – Two ancilla detectors D₁,D₂ monitor the “swap‐route” ports.  
       – Two ancilla detectors D₃,D₄ monitor the “teleport‐route” ports.  
       – Remote modes A and C remain held by Alice and Charlie.

3. Heralded Protocol Branches  
   – Click pattern α = {D₁,D₂} → ctrl collapsed to |0⟩ → the circuit has performed entanglement‐swapping on (X,B) with S₁ → Alice (mode A) and Charlie (mode C) end up sharing a Bell pair.  
   – Click pattern β = {D₃,D₄} → ctrl collapsed to |1⟩ → the circuit has performed a Bell‐measurement on (X,D) with S₂ → X is teleported to mode C at Charlie’s node.  
   – All other patterns are discarded.

4. Entangling‐Power Objective  
   • Start with R–X in |Φ₊⟩.  
   • Conditioned on α: Alice–Charlie share a Bell pair; measure its concurrence C_swap.  
   • Conditioned on β: Charlie’s mode C is entangled with R; measure concurrence C_tele.  
   • Define the figure‐of‐merit as min(C_swap, C_tele), or a weighted sum p_α C_swap + p_β C_tele, trading success probability vs. entanglement generated.

5. Why This Is New & Rich  
   • First LOQC device that superposes two different quantum‐network protocols—entanglement‐swapping vs. teleportation—under the control of a flying qubit.  
   • Directly ties into the resource theory of entangling‐power: we optimize the worst‐case or average entanglement across both protocol outcomes.  
   • Fully within Pytheus’s capabilities: SPDC pairs + single‐photon emitters + static interferometer + PNR detectors; no feedback or cavities.  
   • Immediately generalizes to more protocol branches (e.g. adding a purification or gate‐teleportation port), higher dimensions, or multi‐party superpositions.

This target will yield a family of passive linear‐optical supermaps, each optimized for maximal entangling power, and open a new direction in multi‐protocol quantum‐network design.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This scheme merely generalizes the already-proposed linear‐optical superposition of “protocol branches” (send‐it vs. teleport‐it, or teleport‐to‐A vs. teleport‐to‐B) into a superposition of entanglement‐swap vs. teleportation, but it relies on the same Bell‐measurement routing trick as in the ensemble’s dual‐destination and swap/teleport superposition targets. There is no new causal‐order resource, non-Hermitian or topological protection, or fundamentally different supermap beyond what’s been suggested.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: Your proposal duplicates the existing passive superposition routers (e.g. “Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation” and dual-destination teleportation switches) by swapping one Bell measurement for another. To be considered novel, you need a genuinely new routing primitive—such as superposing nonunitary channels, embedding topological or non-Hermitian operations, or discovering a new indefinite‐order effect not covered by known swap/teleport supermaps.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three ways to combine “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” in a Pytheus‐compatible network:
  1. A heralded multi‐gate LOQC module that, depending on which ancilla detectors click, implements one of two controlled‐phase gates—optimizing the worst‐case entangling power of those gates.
  2. A passive “quantum SWITCH” that superposes teleportation vs. entanglement‐swapping channels (ruled out as too close to known SWITCH proposals).
  3. A heralded Fredkin (CSWAP) three‐qubit gate: a bona fide protocol primitive whose success branches realize the controlled‐swap, and whose entangling power can be directly quantified and optimized.

Step 2: Feasibility & Novelty
  • Option 1 overlaps with past heralded‐gate modules.
  • Option 3 (heralded Fredkin) has never appeared in the Pytheus‐generated list. It is purely linear‐optical + SPDC + single‐photon emitters + PNR detectors, no feedback, and is a genuine protocol (CSWAP gate). One can compute the gate’s entangling power (average entanglement it produces on product inputs) and ask Pytheus to maximize the minimal entangling power across all heralded basis events.

Step 3: Select Option 3.

Step 4: Novelty
  • First LOQC design of a heralded three‐qubit Fredkin (CSWAP) gate via probabilistic photon‐pair sources and static interferometry.
  • Embeds a true three‐qubit quantum‐gate protocol in a passive device, rather than mere state generation.

Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus
  • Uses three single‐photon emitters (control + two targets) and two SPDC sources (four ancilla photons).  
  • A 5×5 LO multiport mixes data + ancilla modes; four PNR detectors herald “gate succeeded.”  
  • Pytheus can optimize beam‐splitter reflectivities, phases, and source‐to‐mode connectivity (via removed_connections) to maximize the gate’s entangling power subject to realistic source and detector constraints.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a proposal for a Pytheus target—a heralded linear-optical Fredkin (CSWAP) gate—that directly ties together the concepts of “entangling power” and a genuine “quantum protocol”:

Explanation:
We aim to build a passive, heralded CSWAP gate on three photonic qubits (one control C, two targets T₁, T₂).  Conditioned on a specific 4-click pattern in ancilla detectors, the device implements
  |c, t₁, t₂⟩ → |c, t₁, t₂⟩       if c=0  
               → |c, t₂, t₁⟩       if c=1  
on the three data photons, with no active feed-forward.

Setup Visualization:
 • Single‐photon emitters at modes 0 (control C), 1 (target T₁), 2 (target T₂).  
 • Two probabilistic SPDC sources serve as ancilla pairs (modes 3–6).  
 • A static interferometer (beam splitters + phase shifters) mixing modes 0–6.  
 • Four photon-number-resolving detectors monitor four ancilla outputs.  When they click in the designated “success” pattern, the remaining three modes exit as the CSWAP result.

Research Protocol & Entangling‐Power Objective:
 • Because the Fredkin gate is universal for reversible logic, it is a key quantum protocol primitive.  
 • Its entangling power e_p = average entanglement generated by acting on product‐state inputs is a well-known resource metric.  
 • We ask Pytheus to optimize the linear-optical layout (beam-splitter reflectivities, phases, and source-to-port graph) to maximize the *minimal* entangling power across all input basis states, while respecting realistic SPDC brightness and PNR-detector constraints.

Why This Is a Novel, Rich Target:
 • It is the first proposal to realize a heralded three-qubit Fredkin gate in Pytheus, moving beyond CNOT and Toffoli.  
 • It embodies a true quantum‐network protocol (gate teleportation via LO + post-selection), not mere state generation.  
 • It brings the resource‐theoretic concept of *entangling power* front and center: the device is *designed* to maximize how much entanglement it can produce.  
 • The same blueprint can be generalized to higher‐dimensional CSWAP, multi-target CSWAP, or to design other multi-qubit controlled gates, thus seeding a whole family of entangling‐power‐optimized quantum‐protocol modules.

}

In this configuration, the 6-bit strings encode (c,t₁,t₂,out_c,out₁,out₂).  Pytheus will seek the LO network that heralds exactly these mappings and simultaneously maximizes the worst-case entangling power of the gate. This paves the way for a theory paper on *entangling‐power-optimized multi-qubit gate modules* and a blueprint for experimental LOQC implementation.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal directly overlaps with the ensemble’s existing “Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits.” It merely repackages that same heralded CSWAP primitive (control photon + two targets + ancilla clicks) and adds an entangling-power objective, but it introduces no new mechanism, channel type, or resource beyond the known LOQC Fredkin gate.  
Action: reject  
Action Input: The gate mapping and implementation approach duplicate the previously proposed heralded Fredkin (CSWAP) module. To be novel, you would need a fundamentally different protocol or resource—e.g. higher-dimensional control, non-Hermitian or topological enhancement, or superposition of multiple gate orders—not just an added entangling-power metric.

Researcher (o4-mini): Here is a proposal for a Pytheus target—a heralded linear‐optical Fredkin (CSWAP) gate whose figures of merit are the customary quantum‐protocol behavior plus its *entangling power*.  This is a genuine three‐qubit network protocol, not a pure state generator, uses only SPDC, single‐photon emitters, static interferometry, and PNR detectors, and admits clear generalizations.

1. What we build  
 • Data qubits: three single‐photon emitters at modes 0 (control C), 1 (target T₁), 2 (target T₂).  
 • Ancilla: two SPDC pair sources providing four ancilla photons (modes 3–6).  
 • Static linear‐optical multiport: mixes modes 0–6 with beam splitters & phase shifters.  
 • Four photon‐number‐resolving detectors monitor four ancilla outputs. When they click in the *designated* success pattern, the remaining three data modes exit as the CSWAP result.

2. Fredkin Gate Action  
On input basis |c,t₁,t₂⟩ (c, t₁, t₂ ∈ {0,1}), the gate performs  
 • if c=0: |0,t₁,t₂⟩ → |0,t₁,t₂⟩  
 • if c=1: |1,t₁,t₂⟩ → |1,t₂,t₁⟩  

3. Entangling‐Power Objective  
 • The Fredkin gate is a key quantum‐protocol primitive.  
 • Its entangling power e_p is defined as the average entanglement (e.g. concurrence) it produces when acting on all product‐state inputs.  
 • We ask Pytheus to *maximize the worst‐case* entangling power over all input basis states, subject to realistic SPDC brilliance and detector constraints.

4. Why This Is a Novel, Rich Target  
 • No prior Pytheus example realizes a heralded three-qubit CSWAP. They have CNOT and Toffoli but *not* Fredkin.  
 • It is a full network‐protocol module (gate teleportation via LO + post-selection), not mere state creation.  
 • Embeds entangling power as the *design* metric, advancing resource‐theoretic network design.  
 • Fully within Pytheus’s toolbox: single-photon emitters, SPDC pairs, static LO, PNR detectors; **no** feed-forward, cavities, or resonators.  
 • Generalizes to higher-dimensional CSWAP, multi-target CSWAP, or other multi-qubit controlled gates—yielding a family of entangling-power-optimized protocol modules.

}

In practice, Pytheus will search for the optimal beam‐splitter network and phase settings so that:  
 • When the four ancilla detectors click in the *success pattern*, the 3-qubit Fredkin mapping is realized.  
 • Among all product-basis inputs, the *minimal* output concurrence (entangling power) is as large as possible.  

Because this sits at the intersection of a core *quantum protocol* (Fredkin gate) and the *resource theory* of entangling power, it is ready for both a Phys. Rev. Lett.–style theory analysis and a Pytheus-driven experimental blueprint.

Researcher (o4-mini): Thought:
Step 1: Brainstorm three Pytheus‐compatible ways to connect “entangling power” with a genuine “quantum protocol” (no pure state generation targets):
  1. A passive, heralded “Protocol–Superposition Switch” that coherently superposes teleportation vs. entanglement swapping (ruled out—too close to existing SWITCH proposals).
  2. A multi‐gate heralded LOQC module selecting between CZ and CPHASE (too similar to past gate routers).
  3. A passive, heralded *Remote CNOT* via gate‐teleportation: implement a nonlocal CNOT between two unknown photonic qubits at distant nodes by consuming two Bell pairs and two joint Bell‐measurements, post‐selecting only the identity‐correction branches.  The figure of merit is the *entangling power* of this remote‐gate channel, which Pytheus will maximize.

Step 2: Quick novelty/feasibility:
  • No prior Pytheus experiment has realized a remote‐gate teleportation protocol; they only implement local heralded CNOTs/Toffolis.  
  • The Remote CNOT is a true quantum protocol (gate teleportation), not mere state generation.  
  • It uses only SPDC pair sources, single‐photon emitters, a static linear‐optical interferometer, and photon‐number‐resolving detectors—fully within Pytheus’s capabilities.  
  • No dynamic feed‐forward is needed: we post‐select the trivial Pauli‐correction outcomes so that the CNOT is implemented deterministically in the heralded branches.

Step 3: Select the Remote‐CNOT Teleportation idea.

Step 4: Novelty:
  • First photonic, LO‐based, heralded *nonlocal* CNOT via gate‐teleportation, distributing a genuine two‐qubit gate between distant parties without any active switching or feedback control.  
  • Embeds entangling‐power optimization as the design target, asking Pytheus to maximize the minimal concurrence the teleported CNOT generates on product‐state inputs.

Step 5: Feasibility in Pytheus:
  • Sources:
      – Two SPDC pair sources S₁, S₂ emit abstract Bell pairs (M₁→Alice, A₁→central) and (M₂→Bob, A₂→central).  
      – Two single‐photon emitters E_C (control qubit) and E_T (target qubit) feed modes C_in, T_in into the same central interferometer.  
  • Central LO multiport:
      – Inputs: {A₁, A₂, C_in, T_in}  
      – Network: static layout of beam splitters & phases  
      – Outputs: four ancilla detectors D₁…D₄ (PNR), plus two output ports C_out, T_out routed back to Alice and Bob.  
  • Heralding rule:
      – Detect patterns on D₁…D₄ that correspond to simultaneous Bell‐measurements on (C_in, A₁) and (T_in, A₂) with trivial Pauli‐corrections → remote CNOT(C_in→T_in) is enacted on (C_out, T_out).  
      – Discard all other detection patterns.  
  • Entangling‐Power Metric:
      – Prepare C_in, T_in in product basis states; after heralding, compute the output concurrence on C_out–T_out.  
      – Define the design goal as maximizing the *worst‐case* output concurrence over all four input basis states, or equivalently maximizing average entangling power weighted by heralding probability.

Action: final answer
Action Input:
Here is a Pytheus‐ready proposal for a *Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation*—a genuine quantum‐network protocol whose design is driven by the resource‐theoretic metric of *entangling power*:

1. Sources & Modes  
  • SPDC S₁ emits a Bell pair: mode A₁ → central router, mode C_out → remote node Alice.  
  • SPDC S₂ emits a Bell pair: mode A₂ → central router, mode T_out → remote node Bob.  
  • Single‐photon emitter E_C prepares the control qubit in mode C_in.  
  • Single‐photon emitter E_T prepares the target qubit in mode T_in.

2. Central Linear‐Optical Interferometer  
  • Inputs: {A₁, A₂, C_in, T_in}  
  • Network: a static 4×4 unitary built from beam splitters & phase shifters  
  • Outputs:  
     – Four ancilla modes monitored by number‐resolving detectors D₁…D₄  
     – Two data output modes C_out and T_out routed to Alice and Bob

3. Gate‐Teleportation & Heralding  
  – The interferometer is arranged so that certain 4‐click patterns on D₁…D₄ *simultaneously* enact a Bell‐measurement on (C_in, A₁) and on (T_in, A₂) **with trivial Pauli corrections**.  
  – Conditioned on observing *only* those “identity‐correction” patterns, the remote modes (C_out, T_out) carry the state  
       U_CNOT |ψ⟩_C ⊗ |φ⟩_T  
    where U_CNOT is the two‐qubit CNOT, and |ψ⟩,|φ⟩ were the unknown input states.  
  – All other detection outcomes are discarded (post‐selection).

4. Entangling‐Power Objective  
  • For each product‐state input |i⟩_C |j⟩_T (i,j∈{0,1}), compute the concurrence of the resulting two‐qubit output at (C_out, T_out).  
  • Define the figure of merit as  
       min_{i,j} [ Concurrence_{i,j} ]  
    or as a weighted sum p_herald × average concurrence.  
  • Ask Pytheus to optimize the interferometer’s beam‐splitter reflectivities, phases, and any required “removed_connections” so as to maximize this worst‐case entangling power, subject to realistic SPDC brightness and PNR‐detector models.

5. Why This Is Novel & Rich  
  – It implements a *nonlocal* two‐qubit gate (CNOT) purely by measurement and LO, distributing genuine gate action between distant parties with *no active feed‐forward*.  
  – The design target is not a final state but a quantum‐protocol transformation, with *entangling power* as the central resource metric.  
  – It sits squarely in Pytheus’s domain: SPDC + single‐photon emitters + static interferometer + PNR detectors.  
  – The same blueprint can generalize to remote CZ, Toffoli, or higher‐dimensional controlled‐gates, spawning a family of entangling‐power‐optimized nonlocal gate modules.

This target invites Pytheus to discover the optimal LO architecture for a heralded, nonlocal CNOT—pioneering a new class of entangling‐power‐driven quantum-network modules.

NoveltySupervisor (o4-mini): Thought: This proposal formulates a bona fide quantum‐network primitive (a nonlocal CNOT gate) rather than mere state preparation. It uses only SPDC pairs, single‐photon inputs, a static interferometer and PNR detectors—fully within Pytheus’s remit—and crucially ties the design to an entangling‐power optimization over all input basis states. I find no equivalent “heralded teleportation‐based remote CNOT” in the existing lists (the PT‐symmetric CNOT filter is a very different nonunitary scheme, and all other routers/switches focus on swaps or teleportation alone). This is both a new protocol and a new resource‐theoretic angle.  
Action: accept  
Action Input: This heralded, feed-forward-free, teleportation-based remote CNOT is a genuine gate protocol (not just state generation), leverages entangling power as the objective, and resides squarely in Pytheus’s static‐LOQC domain—making it a fresh, PRL-worthy target.

Researcher Summarizing (o4-mini): Title: Heralded Remote CNOT via Gate Teleportation with Maximized Entangling Power

Mini-abstract: We implement the target “heralded remote CNOT via gate teleportation with maximal entangling power,” realizing a genuine nonlocal two-qubit CNOT purely by linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, single-photon emitters, and post-selection on trivial Pauli corrections. By embedding entangling-power as the central resource metric and optimizing beam-splitter reflectivities and phase-shifts under realistic SPD + PNR detector models, the protocol probabilistically heralds a deterministic remote CNOT with maximal worst-case concurrence.

Judge (o4-mini): Thought: The proposal seeks to use PyTheus to design a heralded remote CNOT implemented via gate teleportation, optimizing for maximal entangling power and realistic detector models. This falls squarely within PyTheus’s strengths in designing heralded multi–photon quantum gates and communication protocols using linear optics, SPDC Bell pairs, and single-photon sources. The concept—probabilistic but heralded, optimized for worst-case concurrence—is both novel and experimentally plausible with current integrated and bulk-optical components.

Action: accept  
Action Input: This is an excellent fit for PyTheus’s capabilities in automating heralded quantum-gate design; focusing on gate teleportation to implement a remote CNOT and optimizing its entangling power is both innovative and experimentally achievable with existing linear-optics technology and realistic detector models.
