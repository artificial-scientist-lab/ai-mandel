In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols. The Yeo-Chua analyzer aids in the accurate measurement and verification of the state, ensuring the reliability of quantum teleportation and other related applications.\n   \n6. **Mean King's Problem Analyzer (Three-Dimensional Case)**:\n   - Similar to the previous setup, this experiment addresses the Mean King's Problem in three dimensions.

By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace.

The scheme realizes the Ising-anyon associator F as a 2\u00d72 unitary mapping the ((Q\u2081Q\u2082)(Q\u2083Q\u2084)) fusion basis to (Q\u2081(Q\u2082Q\u2083)Q\u2084), thereby demonstrating a fundamental non-Abelian operation with only beam splitters, phase shifters, photon-pair sources, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.Title: Measurement-Induced Topological Percolation for High-Fidelity Qubit Teleportation on a Bell-Pair Toroidal Lattice  \n\nAbstract: We propose a passive linear-optical experiment in which an L\u00d7L toroidal array of probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources and static Bell-state measurement modules undergoes postselected entanglement swapping to drive a topological percolation transition. Our target is to teleport an unknown qubit injected at node A across the torus to node B with high fidelity once a noncontractible entanglement-swap loop percolates across the lattice.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Robust Photonic Qubit Teleportation via Topologically Protected Edge-State Entanglement in an SSH Ladder\n\nMini-abstract: We propose and implement teleportation of a photonic qubit from mode 0 to mode 7 across a two-leg Su\u2013Schrieffer\u2013Heeger ladder by generating and post-selecting a Bell-state between the topologically protected edge modes (0 and 7). Using only linear optics\u2014probabilistic photon-pair sources, ancilla-mediated Bell measurements on weak bonds, and removal of unwanted connections\u2014we target the entanglement of end modes 0 & 7 to achieve disorder-resilient qubit transfer via multi-path interference.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Non-Destructive QND Measurement of Photon-Number Difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND via Mode-Squeezed Ancillas\n\nMini-Abstract: We introduce a PyTheus network primitive that non-destructively measures the photon-number difference \u0394N = NA \u2013 ND between two distant Fock-encoded modes A and D by mixing each with one arm of a two-mode squeezed ancilla at static beam splitters and post-selecting on the ancilla detector difference outcome k. This scheme infers the target \u0394N without disturbing modes A and D, providing a distributed QND observable extraction for syndrome readout and error checking across network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photon-Blockade-Assisted Entanglement Purification of Noisy Bell Pairs\n\nAbstract: We introduce a static linear-optical protocol that combines two probabilistic noisy Bell-pair sources with single-emitter photon-blockade nodes to suppress double-pair emissions and distill the target high-fidelity Bell state |\u03a6\u207a\u27e9=(|00\u27e9+|11\u27e9)/\u221a2. By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled. Our purely probabilistic scheme uses only photon-pair sources, ancillary detectors, and forbidden direct links between non-neighbours to demonstrate a chiral winding of entanglement\u2014an optical analog of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Variational Low-Depth Three-Port Port-Based Teleportation\n\nMini-abstract: We propose the first Pytheus-compatible variational protocol for low-depth port-based teleportation with three ports, directly implementing the target \u201cVariational Low-Depth Port-Based Teleportation with Three Ports.\u201d Our linear-optical network uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources and a single-photon emitter at Alice, a fixed two-layer beam-splitter and phase-shifter ansatz at the central measurement node, and number-resolving detectors to herald and route an unknown photonic qubit to one of three Bobs, with beam-splitter ratios and phase settings optimized to maximize average teleportation fidelity.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Global Single-Excitation Projector P\u2081\u208bex for Three Photonic Qubits\n\nAbstract: We implement a heralded global P\u2081\u208bex supermap on three dual-rail photonic qubits\u2014mixing the data modes with four ancilla photons in a single optimized interferometer and post-selecting on the unique four-click herald (the target Kraus map)\u2014that in one shot accepts only zero- or single-excitation basis states and rejects all double- and triple-excitation inputs. By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths. Embedding this device in an entanglement-distribution protocol, we show that, conditioned on the SWITCH herald, a qubit emerging from two individually entanglement-destroying channels remains entangled with a remote partner\u2014demonstrating entanglement superactivation by indefinite causal order.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Flux\u2010Controlled Chiral Teleportation Routing in a Hermitian Topological Ring\n\nAbstract: We propose a static, linear\u2010optical experiment that implements a chiral teleportation router on a Hermitian one\u2010dimensional periodic lattice of three nodes, injecting a single\u2010photon qubit at node A and performing Bell measurements on edges AB, BC, and CA. By tuning the synthetic gauge\u2010flux phase \u03c6 on the CA beam splitter, we explicitly realize the Pyth eus target mapping\u2014|1,0,0\u27e9_ABC\u2192|0,1,0\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192B channel) at \u03c6=\u03c0 or |0,0,1\u27e9_ABC (A\u2192C channel) at \u03c6=0\u2014with high fidelity, thereby achieving topologically protected, nonreciprocal routing.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation-Mediated Direct Measurement of Discrete Wigner Function Points\n\nAbstract: We propose a single static linear-optical circuit that teleports an unknown photonic qubit from mode A to mode B while applying a programmable phase-space displacement D(\u03b1) and a Bell-like parity measurement to directly report the target discrete Wigner function value W(\u03b1). A single two-click heralding pattern in the Bell interferometer yields (1+W(\u03b1))/2, enabling one-shot negativity witnessing at the chosen phase-space point without active feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nIntegrated Photonic Quantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe demonstrate the target \u201cQuantum Teleportation Router with On-Chip Delay Cavities\u201d by coherently splitting an unknown single-photon qubit at node A and teleporting it, via two independent probabilistic entangled-pair sources and synchronized on-chip delay loops, onto two remote outputs at nodes B and C. Post-selecting a fixed Bell outcome in each Bell-state measurement and employing only passive 50:50 beam splitters, fixed delay cavities, ancilla detectors, and single-photon emitters realizes a genuine quantum routing primitive that maps |\u03c8\u27e9\u2090 \u2192 (|\u03c8\u27e9\u1d66 + |\u03c8\u27e9\ud835\udcb8)/\u221a2 without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nHeralded Linear\u2010Optical 1\u21922 QuTrIt Telecloning via Resonance-Dip Multiport Bell Measurement\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose and analyze a fully linear-optical implementation of the first 1\u21922 qutrit telecloner, in which three probabilistic qutrit-entangled photon-pair sources feed a balanced three-mode multiport Bell measurement module synchronized by identical delay-loop \u201cresonators.\u201d Success of the telecloning is unambiguously heralded by a generalized Hong\u2013Ou\u2013Mandel resonance dip in triple-coincidence ancilla detections, conditionally projecting the two receivers into the optimal symmetric clones of the unknown input qutrit.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Mid\u2010Gap Bell\u2010Pair Extraction in a Dimerized Photonic SSH Repeater Chain  \n\nMini\u2010abstract:  \nWe implement a linear\u2010optical SSH chain of 2M+1 spatial modes using alternating strong (two\u2010pair) and weak (single\u2010pair) photon sources, performing heralded Bell\u2010state measurements at each non\u2010central node.  Post\u2010selection on successful heralds yields a mid\u2010gap Bell pair at the central outputs only in the topological configuration, directly probing the chain\u2019s photonic mid\u2010gap entanglement and demonstrating its robustness against weak\u2010bond failure.Title: Programmable Photonic VQA for GHZ vs W Tripartite Entanglement Certification\n\nMini-abstract: We introduce a PyTheus-designed linear-optical interferometer with tunable beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors, trained via a classical variational loop to classify unknown three-qubit photonic inputs as GHZ-class or W-class states. This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip. Our scheme employs one single-photon emitter for the input qubit, two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a control photon prepared across two spatial modes, and post-selected heralding via four ancilla detectors to achieve coherent, programmable routing of quantum information without dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: \u201cQuantum Battery\u2013Driven Linear-Optical Entanglement Router\u201d\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a purely static linear-optical circuit that uses one ancilla photon as a \u201cquantum battery\u201d to power amplitude-damping Kraus jump operations on one half of three probabilistic Bell pairs, thereby post-selectively swapping entanglement onto exactly one of three remote node pairs via heralded detection. Implemented in the Pytheus static post-selection framework, this battery-powered router converts non-unitary jump channels into a scalable tool for multi-branch entanglement distribution across quantum network nodes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Realization of the Measurement-Only Braiding Superchannel for Two Logical Majorana Qubits\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose an experiment targeting the implementation of the measurement-only braiding superchannel \ud835\udd05 on two logical Majorana qubits encoded in four dual-rail photonic modes. By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly.

However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The optimized linear\u2010optical circuit mixes all six photons; specific four\u2010fold clicks at ancilla detectors herald the successful implementation of the CSWAP unitary, conditionally swapping the two data qubits exactly when the control is in |1\u27e9. Removed connections enforce that each photon starts in its designated mode (no emitter can send directly to the \u201cwrong\u201d detectors). By post\u2010selecting on the herald signal, one realizes a fundamental nonlocal quantum\u2010network protocol\u2014quantum routing\u2014without any form of dynamic feed\u2010forward.\n\nConfig example:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Fredkin (CSWAP) gate\",\n  \"foldername\": \"heralded_fredkin\",\n  \"single_emitters\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],        # qubits 0\u20132 and ancillas 3\u20136\n  \"anc_detectors\":   [3, 4, 5, 6],                  # heralding detectors\n  \"removed_connections\": [[0,3], [0,4], [1,5], [2,6]],\n  \"num_pre\": 1,\n  \"num_anc\": 4,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-6,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 20,\n  \"thresholds\": [0.3, 0.1],\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"imaginary\": false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme duplicates the ensemble\u2019s heralded Fredkin gate.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum Energy Teleportation and Entropy Change due to Feedback Control\n  in One-Dimensional Heisenberg Model\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Sender-controlled measurement-device-independent multiparty quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Entangled Photons and Phonons via Inter-Modal Brillouin Scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Three abstract photonic qubits (control at node 0, data A at node 1, data B at node 2) enter the network alongside four ancilla photons (emitters at nodes 3\u20136). The optimized linear\u2010optical circuit mixes all six photons; specific four\u2010fold clicks at ancilla detectors herald the successful implementation of the CSWAP unitary, conditionally swapping the two data qubits exactly when the control is in |1\u27e9. Removed connections enforce that each photon starts in its designated mode (no emitter can send directly to the \u201cwrong\u201d detectors). By post\u2010selecting on the herald signal, one realizes a fundamental nonlocal quantum\u2010network protocol\u2014quantum routing\u2014without any form of dynamic feed\u2010forward.\n\nConfig example:\n{\n  \"description\": \"Post\u2010selected linear\u2010optical Fredkin (CSWAP) gate\",\n  \"foldername\": \"heralded_fredkin\",\n  \"single_emitters\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],        # qubits 0\u20132 and ancillas 3\u20136\n  \"anc_detectors\":   [3, 4, 5, 6],                  # heralding detectors\n  \"removed_connections\": [[0,3], [0,4], [1,5], [2,6]],\n  \"num_pre\": 1,\n  \"num_anc\": 4,\n  \"edges_tried\": 50,\n  \"ftol\": 1e-6,\n  \"loss_func\": \"cr\",\n  \"optimizer\": \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\": 20,\n  \"thresholds\": [0.3, 0.1],\n  \"number_resolving\": true,\n  \"safe_hist\": true,\n  \"imaginary\": false\n}\n\nNoveltySupervisor Feedback: Your scheme duplicates the ensemble\u2019s heralded Fredkin gate.

It uses only pair sources, Bell analyses, static linear optics, post-selection.  \n 2) QCKA via GHZ relay is close to existing GHZ swap/setups and effectively a state generation.  \n 3) Fingerprinting SWAP\u2010test overlaps with SWAP\u2010test ideas and needs a controlled\u2010swap, which Pytheus cannot easily realize as a static network.  \n\nStep 3: Pick the cyclic teleportation network.  \n\nStep 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment implements a genuine three-party cyclic teleportation (network-coded permutation of three unknown qubits) purely via entanglement-swapping and Bell measurements.  \n\nStep 5: It is feasible in the Pytheus framework because it only requires six probabilistic EPR\u2010pair sources, three static Bell-measurement modules (beam\u2010splitter networks + ancilla detectors), number-resolving detection, and post-selection\u2014no dynamic feed-forward or hyper-entanglement.  \n\nAction: final answer  \nAction Input:\nDescription:\nImplement a three-party cyclic quantum teleportation protocol using only linear optics and post-selection.

Feel free to be very critical and sceptic of their ideas while remaining constructive. Only accept the idea if you think it could be something that the scientific community may not have considered yet.\n\nThe idea should be good enough to be published in the APS journal PRL, which is very selective.\n\nExperiments that only generate a quantum state can not be considered novel. \n\nHere is a list of experiments previously explored by human researchers. A novel idea should not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nSTART OF LIST OF EXPLORED EXPERIMENTS\n\n1. **Entangling Two Photons That Never Interacted with Bell Pairs**:\n   - Demonstrates the entanglement of two photons that have never interacted directly, using Bell pairs. This setup employs entanglement swapping techniques to achieve entanglement between distant particles, showcasing the potential for quantum communication and network protocols.\n   \n2. **Entanglement Swapping of Three Bell Pairs (Four Additional Particles)**:\n   - This experiment demonstrates entanglement swapping between three Bell pairs, requiring four additional particles. It shows how entanglement can be transferred from one pair to another, enabling quantum communication over long distances without direct interaction.\n\n3. **Entanglement Swapping for Two Pairs of Qutrits (Six Additional Particles)**:\n   - Produces entanglement swapping between two pairs of qutrits using six additional particles. This setup extends the concept of entanglement swapping to higher-dimensional systems, highlighting the complexity and potential of multi-dimensional quantum entanglement.\n\n4. **Entanglement Swapping with Single-Photon Sources**:\n   - Demonstrates entanglement swapping using single-photon sources. The experiment creates a three-dimensional Bell state, showing the feasibility of using deterministic single-photon sources for complex quantum communication tasks.\n   \n5. **Yeo-Chua Analyzer**:\n   - This analyzer is used for the Yeo-Chua state, a quantum state used in certain teleportation protocols.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum Energy Teleportation and Entropy Change due to Feedback Control\n  in One-Dimensional Heisenberg Model\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Sender-controlled measurement-device-independent multiparty quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Entangled Photons and Phonons via Inter-Modal Brillouin Scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements.

Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.

By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Programmable Three-Destination Quantum Teleportation to the Choitarget State\n\nAbstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes \u221a\u03b1, \u221a\u03b2, \u221a\u03b3 across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve.

This protocol explicitly targets the certification of genuine multipartite entanglement structure in photonic systems and can be implemented on current programmable photonic hardware.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nMeasurement-Based Logical Hadamard via Anyon Braiding in a Toric-Code PEPS Network\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe propose a linear-optics experiment that first projects a 3\u00d73 array of probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources into the Z\u2082 toric-code PEPS ground subspace using four-photon Bell-measurement modules, then injects a single-photon \u201cdata qubit\u201d and teleports it around a nontrivial toric loop by sequential entanglement-swap measurements on boundary edges.  By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

By employing entangled ancilla photon-pair sources, a configurable multiport interferometer of beam splitters and phase shifters, and heralded number-resolving detection, our purely linear-optical protocol enacts the non-unitary Kraus decomposition of the anyonic braid map without dynamic feedback or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cascaded Partial-Bell Filters as a Passive Metamaterial for Heralded Entanglement\u2013Bandpass Filtering\n\nMini-Abstract: We present a four-mode linear-optical network comprising two back-to-back tunable partial-Bell analyzer modules that realizes the target heralded entanglement\u2013bandpass filtering entirely via passive optics and post-selection. By scanning the beam-splitter reflectivities and inter-module phase, the heralded success probability and output entanglement fidelity exhibit multi-peak resonance windows directly analogous to coupled nano-resonator band structures.\n\n\nEND OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nUse your best judgement on what is 'too similar'.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Three abstract photonic qubits (control at node 0, data A at node 1, data B at node 2) enter the network alongside four ancilla photons (emitters at nodes 3\u20136). The optimized linear\u2010optical circuit mixes all six photons; specific four\u2010fold clicks at ancilla detectors herald the successful implementation of the CSWAP unitary, conditionally swapping the two data qubits exactly when the control is in |1\u27e9. Removed connections enforce that each photon starts in its designated mode (no emitter can send directly to the \u201cwrong\u201d detectors).

By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace. Post-selecting six-fold coincidences that pair each emitter Ei with Ei+3 directly yields the fidelity overlap of the target triplet states, demonstrating a scalable network-measurement primitive for modular atom-photon quantum systems.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nDirectional Entanglement Swapping with Simulated Skin and Mott Photon\u2010Blockade Effects\n\nAbstract:\nWe propose a three\u2010site entanglement\u2010swapping chain that teleports a Bell state from Alice ([0]) to Bob ([1]) using three probabilistic SPDC sources ([2,3,4]), with non\u2010Hermitian \u201cskin\u201d localization enforced by removing all backward source\u2013detector links and an on\u2010site Mott\u2010like photon blockade realized by heralding on the central ancilla ([6]). By configuring Pythues to optimize the internal beam\u2010splitter network under these directional and blockade constraints, we can sweep the teleportation fidelity of the target \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 state between a uniform \u201csuperfluid\u201d regime and a gapped, localized \u201cMott\u201d regime within a single linear\u2010optical setup.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Telecom-Band Frequency-Bin Teleportation MUX for Qubit\u2192Ququart Isometry\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a fully passive, measurement-assisted linear-optical circuit that fuses two qubits, each encoded in a Kerr microcomb\u2019s telecom-band frequency bins, into a single ququart channel via teleportation.  Using two probabilistic Bell-pair photon sources, ancilla modes, a static interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, the heralded Choistate  \n\u2211_{i,j\u2208{0,1}} |i,j\u27e9_in |2i+j\u27e9_out  \nrealizes the isometry mapping |00\u27e9\u2192|0\u27e9, |01\u27e9\u2192|1\u27e9, |10\u27e9\u2192|2\u27e9 and |11\u27e9\u2192|3\u27e9 without dynamic feed-forward or cavities.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Ancilla-Controlled Programmable Coherent Bell Analyzer\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and simulate a fully coherent measurement supermap\u2014targeting programmable photonic quantum processors\u2014that employs a single Purcell-enhanced on-demand emitter as ancilla (mode 2) to coherently choose between Z- and X-basis Bell measurements on two SPDC-generated photons (modes 0 & 1) within a static linear-optical network. By entangling the control qubit (mode 3) with the Bell-outcome recorded on four ancilla detectors (modes 4\u20137), this design realizes the first programmable photonic Bell analyzer in PyTheus, obviating active switching or teleportation for coherent basis selection.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Experimental Realization of a Nonlocal Parity Gate for Semi-Quantum Key Agreement\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose a target PyTheus-compatible linear-optical network in which two classical users, Alice and Bob, each send Z-basis single photons to a fully quantum node, Charlie, who entangles them with his ancilla Bell pair and performs post-selected entanglement-swapping to nonlocally compute their parity x\u2295y as a shared key bit. This minimal experiment\u2014requiring only probabilistic photon-pair sources, beam splitters, phase shifters, and photon-number-resolving detectors without dynamic feed-forward\u2014demonstrates a novel nonlocal XOR primitive and provides a direct semi-quantum key agreement primitive.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Collision\u2010Mode Photonic MPO Simulation of Lindblad Open\u2010System Dynamics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract: We propose a static one\u2010dimensional photonic matrix\u2010product\u2010operator (MPO) network\u2014built from probabilistic Bell\u2010pair sources, tunable beam splitters, and number\u2010resolving detectors\u2014to stroboscopically enact the small\u2010time Kraus maps E_k = e^{L\u0394t} that realize the target Lindblad generator L over total time T = N\u0394t. By heralding jump/non\u2010jump outcomes on ancilla detectors and optimizing fixed optical connections in PyTheus, this scheme approximates arbitrary Markovian (and, via memory links, non\u2010Markovian) open\u2010system dynamics without dynamic feedforward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Programmable Three-Destination Quantum Teleportation to the Choitarget State\n\nAbstract: We propose a cascaded, condensate-tuned beam-splitter protocol that heraldedly teleports an unknown photonic qubit into the fixed pure-state Choitarget on modes [R,C,D,E], distributing amplitudes \u221a\u03b1, \u221a\u03b2, \u221a\u03b3 across recipients Charlie, Dave, and Eve. By conditioning on exactly one Bell-measurement click, this scheme realizes a coherent superposition of three teleportation branches with weights \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 set in situ via atomic lattice depths\u2014enabling N-way teleportation without active optical switching.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Cyclic Indefinite\u2010Order Entanglement\u2010Swapping Switch for the Three-State Bargmann Invariant\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static linear-optical network that path-controls a single photon to cyclically superpose three successive Bell\u2013swap orders among unknown qubits A, B, and C, recombining all nine modes in a fixed nine-port interferometer and reading out a binary \u201c+\u201d/\u201c\u2013\u201d outcome. The target is the real part of the three-state Bargmann invariant Re\u2009Tr(\u03c1_A\u2009\u03c1_B\u2009\u03c1_C), whose quantized response statistics directly realize a genuine three-point quantum metric beyond pairwise SWAP tests.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Sequential Non-Demolition Qutrit Measurement Network for KCBS Contextuality via Tunable Ancilla Coupling\n\nMini-abstract: We target a sequential nondestructive qutrit measurement network for KCBS contextuality with tunable ultrastrong-coupling ancillas, implementing the five-node pentagon test by entangling a single-photon qutrit with five ancilla photons through beam splitters of adjustable reflectivity R\u2081\u2026R\u2085. By sweeping each R\u1d62 from \u00bd (weak, unsharp) to 1 (ultrastrong, near-projective) coupling, we realize a genuine measurement-induced quantum network primitive and systematically explore how KCBS inequality violations survive under partial-strength sequential measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Teleportation of a Single-Photon Qubit through a Coherent Superposition of Markovian and Non-Markovian Channels\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an optical teleportation experiment in which an unknown target qubit is split into two rails that interact with engineered ancilla chains\u2014one Markovian and one non-Markovian\u2014before being coherently recombined. A Bell-state measurement at Charlie, conditioned on specific click patterns, heralds the successful teleportation of the target quantum to Bob, with fidelity controlled by beam-splitter reflectivities and memory-chain parameters.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation\n\nAbstract: In the PythyUS target \u201cQuantum Superposition of Direct-Transmission vs. Heralded Teleportation,\u201d a single-photon control qubit, prepared via an optical nanofiber\u2013coupled atom array, coherently steers an incoming signal photon into either a direct\u2010fiber transmission arm or a passive, post-selected Bell\u2010teleportation block within one linear-optics circuit. By conditioning on heralding detector clicks, the experiment realizes interference between the \u201csend-it\u201d and \u201cteleport-it\u201d arrival modes at the receiver, demonstrating coherent superposition of two fundamentally different quantum communication channels without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Entanglement-Assisted Teleported Error-Detecting Channel (EAQECC-Teleport)\n\nAbstract: We implement a linear-optical network that realizes the target transformation\u2014teleporting a logical qubit from sender A to receiver D while detecting any single-photon erasure\u2014by embedding a (3,1) entanglement-assisted quantum error-detecting code across two relay nodes B and C. Four probabilistic Bell-pair sources and post-selected Bell measurements perform preshared entanglement encoding at A, entanglement swapping at B/C, and decoding at D, heralding both correct qubit transmission and detection of single-photon loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum Butterfly Network for Simultaneous Cross-Teleportation of Two SiV Spin Qubits\n\nAbstract: We propose and implement a post\u2010selected \u201cquantum butterfly\u201d network code that, via a single four-photon linear-optic joint measurement, simultaneously teleports two independent spin qubits\u2014|\u03c8\u27e9 at node A and |\u03c6\u27e9 at node C\u2014encoded in silicon-vacancy color centers to remote spin nodes D and B, respectively. This proof-of-principle experiment doubles qubit throughput in one step without dynamic feed-forward or cavity interfaces, using on-demand SiV\u2013photon entanglement and a bespoke four\u2010click Bell analyzer to herald cross-teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nPhotonic Implementation of a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer  \n\nAbstract:  \nWe demonstrate a Blockade-Enabled 1D Entanglement Renormalization (BE-ER) Layer acting on an eight-qubit photonic chain, where nearest-neighbor probabilistic photon-pair sources feed cascaded Bell measurements as MERA-style disentanglers and isometries under a Rydberg-blockade\u2013inspired connectivity constraint.  This linear-optical network coarse-grains the input qubits into four renormalized outputs while exactly preserving the area-law entanglement profile, opening a new platform to study entanglement scaling under blockade-limited architectures.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nSingle-Shot Linear-Optical Discrimination of Phonon-Photon Transduction Channels  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe propose and optimize a static, post-selected linear-optical interferometer that in one shot discriminates between two non-commuting phonon-to-photon transduction channels T\u2081 and T\u2082, explicitly targeting the minimization of the Helstrom error probability. Leveraging single-emitter probe and ancilla photons, beam splitters, phase shifters, and number-resolving detectors within the PythOptics framework, our scheme implements the first photonic channel-discrimination primitive for unknown transducers without feedback control.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Multi-Frequency GHZ Entanglement Swapping for Three-Node Quantum Networks\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an on-chip multi-frequency entanglement-swapping protocol that projects three frequency-encoded qubits onto the GHZ basis, thereby distributing genuine tripartite GHZ entanglement among three remote nodes A, B, and C. Our scheme employs three probabilistic photonic Bell-pair sources, enforced frequency-demultiplexing via removed connections, a 6\u00d76 beam-splitter\u2013phase-shifter network, and four number-resolving detectors with post-selection to realize a single non-separable three-qubit projection across spectral bins, revealing inter-frequency coherence unattainable by independent Bell measurements.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Linear-Optical 4D Bell-State Analyzer for Frequency-Encoded Photonic Ququarts\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a fully passive, post-selected linear-optical network that combines dielectric photonic-crystal spectral demultiplexers with a metasurface-fabricated 10\u00d710 multiport interferometer to unambiguously discriminate the four generalized Bell states of two photonic ququarts, each encoded in four narrowband frequency bins. In the current experiment, the explicit target is to herald each of the four Bell-state outcomes using two ancilla photons and ten number-resolving detectors\u2014realizing, for the first time, a high-dimensional Bell-state analyzer to enable ququart teleportation.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Symmetry-Protected Bound-State Bell-State Analyzer on a Four-Site SSH Chain\n\nMini-abstract: We demonstrate an SPBS Bell-State Analyzer that injects an unknown two-photon Bell state into end modes of a one-dimensional four-site SSH chain of dipole emitters, guiding the photons through optimized nearest-neighbor linear-optical couplings and number-resolving detectors on the central modes (target: Bell-State Analyzer). By post-selecting on exactly two clicks with distinct symmetric versus antisymmetric clustering patterns on the zero-energy bound-state manifold, our analyzer gains topological symmetry protection against imperfections and achieves enhanced Bell-state discrimination fidelity over conventional linear-optical schemes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Quantum-Controlled Time-Bin Basis Entanglement Swapping in the Telecom Band\n\nAbstract: We realize a basis-controlled entanglement swapping protocol for telecom-band time-bin qubits by preparing a single-photon control qubit in the superposition (|early\u232a+e^{i\u03c6}|late\u232a) to route two SPDC-generated Bell pairs between nodes A\u2013R and R\u2013C into either a Z-basis (M_Z) or an X-basis (M_X) Bell-swap module.

Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

Three parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie) each send one single photon (their qubit) to an untrusted central node.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace.

By performing a parity check on one photon from each pair via a 50:50 beam splitter and enforcing \u22641-photon inputs through photon-blockade ancillae, specific heralding detection patterns project the remaining photons onto the purified Bell state within the PyTheus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Path\u2010Identity Mediated Entanglement Swapping with Finite-Q Ancilla Field\n\nMini-Abstract: We demonstrate a static linear-optical network that replaces the conventional Bell\u2010state measurement with a multi\u2010path, path-identity mechanism across M ancilla photons to herald entanglement between two target photons B\u2081 and B\u2082. By treating the finite number of indistinguishable ancilla paths as a discrete \u201cquality factor\u201d Q and using Pytheus to optimize beam splitters and phase shifters, we selectively filter successful click patterns to maximize the swapped\u2010entanglement fidelity of the target modes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Catalytic Entanglement Amplification of Bell Pairs via a Squeezed-Reservoir Ancilla in Pure LOQC\n\nAbstract: We present a static LOQC circuit that catalytically amplifies the entanglement of two weak Bell pairs in modes (A,B) and (C,D) using a non-maximally entangled squeezed-reservoir ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082). By mixing modes {B,R\u2081} and {C,R\u2082} on two beam splitters and post-selecting on a fixed two-click photon-number pattern at detectors on B and C, the protocol realizes the target transformation in which modes A and D emerge in a stronger Bell-like state |00\u27e9+K(\u03b1,r)|11\u27e9 while the squeezed ancilla (R\u2081,R\u2082) is returned unchanged.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Anomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Photonic Ring\n\nMini\u2010abstract: We present a static linear-optical realization of the target \u201cAnomalous Floquet Entanglement Pump on a 1D Ring,\u201d in which two complementary heralded measurement outcomes implement alternating Bell-pair swaps on a ring of four photonic parties, thereby pumping entanglement chirally around the loop while the bulk remains disentangled.

By alternating this primitive with single-qubit \u03c3\u2093 rotations, we Trotterize the 1D Rydberg Hamiltonian H_Ryd = \u03a9\u2211_i\u03c3\u2093^i + V\u2211_{\u27e8i,j\u27e9}n_i n_j with blockade radius spanning three sites, thus emulating the nonlinear many-body Rydberg blockade measurement in a photonic network.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Linear-Optical 1\u21922 Telecloning via Lossy Quantum Memories  \n\nMini-Abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded telecloning channel that maps an unknown single-photon qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 at node A onto two approximate clones at nodes B and C by routing its excitation into two lossy memory modes and then swapping them back via tunable beam splitters. By optimizing the write/read reflectivities {r_w\u2081,r_w\u2082,r_r\u2081,r_r\u2082} to achieve the target average cloning fidelity F_target = 5/6 under a minimum success probability p_min, our scheme fully exploits PytHeus\u2019s optimization framework to quantify the trade-off between coupling strengths and finite photon lifetimes.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded Measurement-Based Fredkin Gate on Polarization-Encoded Target Qubits\n\nMini-abstract: We present a purely linear-optical, heralded implementation of the Fredkin (controlled-SWAP) gate in which a \u201ccorner-mode\u201d single-photon qubit serves as control and two polarization-encoded photons serve as the explicit swap targets. Conditioned on a specific four-ancilla photon click pattern, the remaining three photons enact the Fredkin truth table\u2014swapping the two polarization target qubits only when the control photon is in the logical |1\u27e9 state\u2014without any dynamic feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nPT-Symmetric Gain\u2013Loss Filter\u2013Enhanced Teleportation for High-Fidelity Remote CNOT\n\nMini-Abstract:\nWe demonstrate a heralded, non-unitary PT-symmetric gain\u2013loss filter embedded in the Bell-state measurement of a teleportation-based CNOT between photonic qubit A (control) and qubit C (target). By using SPDC-pair ancillas, four-port interferometric mixing, and number-resolving detection to preferentially amplify even-parity Bell components, our scheme surpasses the 50% passive-linear-optics limit and boosts both the success probability and fidelity of the nonlocal CNOT gate.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Quantum SWITCH Superactivates Entanglement via Indefinite Causal Order\n\nMini-abstract: We implement the target measurement-induced photonic quantum SWITCH of two entanglement-breaking dephasing channels using ancilla photons, passive linear optics, and post-selection to emulate a discrete cross-Kerr coupling between a control and two data paths.

By heralding successful teleportation outcomes, this measurement-driven anyon braiding enacts the logical Hadamard gate (|0\u27e9\u2192|+\u27e9, |1\u27e9\u2192|\u2013\u27e9) on the target qubit, realizing a protected nontrivial quantum logic operation without dynamic feedback or cavity interactions.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Dual-Destination Quantum Teleportation Switch on a Photonic Chip\n\nMini-abstract: We target the teleportation of an unknown qubit to one of two receiver nodes under the quantum control of a single-photon \u201caddress\u201d qubit, realized entirely with Pytheus-compatible elements on a fixed linear-optics photonic chip.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task. They just serve as a starting point, you can additionally use your full physics knowledge to solve the task.\n\nSTART OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nPaper 1: Quantum Energy Teleportation and Entropy Change due to Feedback Control\n  in One-Dimensional Heisenberg Model\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 2: Sender-controlled measurement-device-independent multiparty quantum\n  communication\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPaper 3: Entangled Photons and Phonons via Inter-Modal Brillouin Scattering\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nEND OF PAPER ABSTRACTS FOR INSPIRATION\n\nWe have collected some feedback by domain experts on research ideas.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This only needs single-photon emitters, one ancilla pair source, a static tritter/beam-splitter network, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  \n    2) Heralded SWAP has been covered in \u201cheralded Fredkin\u201d and related gate-teleportation examples.  \n    3) Multi-sender dense coding is interesting but requires decoding of two independent classical messages via a joint four-photon projection (effectively a Toffoli or higher) which is complex and may reduce to known post-selected Toffoli gates.\n  Step 3: Pick the MDI-QCKA via a GHZ analyzer.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment realizes a three-photon GHZ-basis measurement for conference-key agreement. It elevates entanglement-swapping to a real cryptographic protocol rather than mere state generation.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only static linear optics, three single-photon inputs (the parties\u2019 qubits), one probabilistic Bell-pair source (ancilla), number-resolving detectors, no feedback, and post-selection on a GHZ projection click pattern.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a measurement-device-independent quantum conference-key-agreement protocol using a post-selected linear-optical GHZ-basis analyzer. Three parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie) each send one single photon (their qubit) to an untrusted central node. The node mixes these three photons plus two ancilla photons (from one Bell-pair source) in a static linear-optical network (beam splitters/tritters), then reads out a six-click detector pattern that unambiguously projects onto one of the eight three-qubit GHZ states. Whenever the central node obtains a \u201cGHZ0\u207a\u201d outcome (post-selected via a unique 4-click signature in ancillary detectors), the three parties know that k_A\u2295k_B\u2295k_C=0 and can extract one shared key bit. By randomly choosing preparation and sifting bases, they realize a full MDI-conference-key-agreement protocol immune to detector side-channel attacks.\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  \"description\":         \"MDI conference-key agreement via linear-optical GHZ analyzer\",\n  \"foldername\":          \"mdi_qcka_ghz_analyzer\",\n  \"single_emitters\":     [0,1,2],        # Alice, Bob, Charlie input photons\n  \"num_pair_sources\":    1,              # ancilla Bell-pair for GHZ measurement\n  \"anc_detectors\":       [6,7,8,9],      # used to herald a GHZ0\u207a projection\n  \"removed_connections\": [[0,3],[1,4],[2,5]],  # no direct input\u2192wrong ancilla\n  \"num_pre\":             1,\n  \"num_anc\":             4,\n  \"edges_tried\":         50,\n  \"loss_func\":           \"cr\",\n  \"optimizer\":           \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\":             20,\n  \"thresholds\":          [0.3,0.1],\n  \"number_resolving\":    true,\n  \"safe_hist\":           true,\n  \"imaginary\":           false\n}\n\nVisualization:\n  Emitters: [0](Alice) [1](Bob) [2](Charlie) + pair-source \u2192 [3,4]  \n  Static tritter/BS network mixes modes 0\u20135  \n  Detectors: [5](GHZ output) + ancilla detectors [6,7,8,9]  \n  Post-select on the unique 4-click pattern \u2192 herald GHZ0\u207a.  \n  Parties then reveal basis choices and distil a shared key bit from each heralded event.\n\nGoal:\nShow how nonlocal GHZ correlations, harnessed by a measurement-device-independent GHZ analyzer, implement a full three-party quantum key-distribution protocol\u2014with a static, post-selected linear-optical network and no state-generation focus.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology. A specific three-click herald pattern routes the remaining photons in the cyclic order, directly mimicking the ring-exchange term of the triangular Heisenberg spin-liquid without generating any static entangled state.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Photonic Realization of the 4-Qubit Stabilizer Phase-Jump Channel (4q_stabilizer_jump)\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe implement the PythEUS target \u201c4q_stabilizer_jump\u201d by constructing a linear-optical network that mixes four single-photon data qubits (modes 0\u20133) with two probabilistic pair sources (modes 4\u20137) and post-selects on exactly one click in each of the four ancilla detectors to herald the multi-qubit phase gate U_S implementing S = Z\u2297Z\u2297Z\u2297Z. By averaging over heralded events, we realize the discrete map \u03c1\u2192(1\u2212p)\u03c1+pS\u03c1S which, in the limit of many repetitions, converges to the Lindblad master equation d\u03c1/dt=\u03b3[S\u03c1S\u2212\u03c1], thus demonstrating measurement-induced four-body Pauli jump dynamics without feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle  \nPhotonic Qudit Butterfly: Resource-Efficient d-Dimensional Quantum Network Coding\n\nMini-abstract  \nWe present a photonic realization of the d-dimensional \u201cQudit Butterfly\u201d protocol, explicitly targeting the simultaneous transmission of two unknown qudit states |\u03c8\u2081\u27e9 and |\u03c8\u2082\u27e9 from senders Alice\u2081 (node A) and Alice\u2082 (node B) to receivers R\u2081 and R\u2082 over a single d-dimensional bottleneck channel. By using only three d-dimensional Bell-pair sources, one static multiport interferometer performing a projective d-SUM parity measurement, and two local d-dimensional Bell measurements with post-selection, our scheme cuts entanglement consumption versus naive teleportation and scales straightforwardly to arbitrary dimension d\u2009>\u20092.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \n2\u00d72 Entanglement Percolation Network for Semi-Quantum Key Distribution  \n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe target the implementation of a 2\u00d72 quantum percolation network for semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) in a purely linear-optical, P\u2006ytheus-compatible setup. Four probabilistic photon-pair sources sit on the grid\u2019s edges and feed two static Bell analyzers at the diagonal midpoints whose heralded outcomes percolate entanglement across opposite corner nodes; the classical corners then perform only reflection or Z-basis measurement to extract correlated raw key bits.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: On-Chip Indefinite-Order Photonic Superchannel Switch\n\nAbstract: We target the design of an integrated-photonic \u201csuperchannel switch\u201d that coherently superposes two distinct quantum network primitives\u2014entanglement swapping (ES) and quantum teleportation (QT)\u2014in indefinite causal order. By combining two probabilistic Bell-pair sources, a single-photon input qubit and a control ancilla in a fixed linear-optical interferometer, we perform Bell-state measurements and post-select on \u201c+\u201d outcomes to herald a coherent superposition of the ES\u2192QT and QT\u2192ES sequences, all without active feed-forward.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Teleportation-Based Nonlocal Controlled-Phase Gate (CPhase\u2083) for Two Qutrits\n\nMini-Abstract:  \nWe present a PytHeus-compatible linear-optical network that teleports a controlled\u2010phase gate CPhase\u2083 across two remote qutrits A and B by using two entangled Bell-like qutrit photon pairs, four ancillary photons, and Charlie\u2019s joint ancilla measurement to herald successful post-selected gate application. The scheme encodes the d=3 complex phase map \u03c9^{ij} (with \u03c9\u2009=\u2009e^{2\u03c0i/3}) on the basis states |i\u27e9\u2090|j\u27e9\u1d66 without any direct A\u2013B coupling, realizing a genuine higher-dimensional logical primitive in the PytHeus framework.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Heralded CPHASE\u2010Gate Sensor for Nonlinear Product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B Detection\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a heralded linear-optical protocol that entangles two remote static phase shifts \u03c6_A and \u03c6_B via an ancilla-assisted CPHASE gate, imprinting the nonlinear product cos\u2009\u03c6_A\u00b7cos\u2009\u03c6_B into the conditioned joint click probability. By calibrating and subtracting the individual cos\u2009\u03c6_A and cos\u2009\u03c6_B fringes, the scheme isolates the target phase product \u03c6_A\u00b7\u03c6_B and attains near-Heisenberg scaling in Fisher information with full loss tolerance.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nOn\u2010Chip Three\u2010Photon Repetition\u2010Code Logical\u2010Bell State Analyzer in Silicon Photonics\n\nMini\u2010Abstract:  \nWe propose and design an integrated silicon\u2010photonic circuit that implements an error\u2010detecting logical\u2010Bell state measurement on two qubits encoded in the three\u2010photon repetition code, using six waveguide modes, tunable Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer parity\u2010check modules, and a final multiport interferometer. This analyzer unambiguously discriminates all four logical Bell states (|\u03a6\u00b1\u27e9\u2097, |\u03a8\u00b1\u27e9\u2097) while simultaneously heralding single\u2010photon loss errors via on\u2010chip photon\u2010number\u2010resolving detectors, fully compatible with Pyth\u00e9us linear\u2010optics primitives.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Protected Non-Abelian D\u2083 Teleportation Router on a Three-Node Photonic Triangle\n\nMini-Abstract: We propose and analyze an all-linear-optical experiment that uses three probabilistic Bell-pair sources, beam splitters, and a fixed two-photon ancilla fusion measurement to teleport an unknown target qubit |\u03c8\u27e9 from node A onto one of the three network nodes (A, B, or C) while enacting a non-Abelian D\u2083 group operation (120\u00b0 rotation or mirror reflection) on the teleported target. By conditioning on which of the four ancilla outcomes clicks, both the teleportation destination and the specific D\u2083 unitary emerge intrinsically from the network\u2019s static homology, yielding a protected, topology-invariant routing primitive robust to link loss.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Testing Non-Commutativity of Dissipative Lindblad Channels via Entanglement Swapping\n\nMini-Abstract: We implement a static, purely linear-optical network using two SPDC Bell-pair sources, amplitude- and phase-damping beam-splitter ancillas, and a post-selected Bell-state measurement to swap entanglement through the two Lindblad maps L\u2081 (amplitude damping) and L\u2082 (phase damping) in both orders. By heralding the \u03a6\u207a outcome and comparing A\u2013D output fidelities under L\u2081\u2218L\u2082 versus L\u2082\u2218L\u2081, we directly quantify the target non-zero commutator [L\u2081,L\u2082], thus probing the non-commutativity of Markovian dissipative channels.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:\nTopology-Protected Corner-to-Corner Teleportation in a 2\u00d72 SSH Photonic Network\n\nMini-abstract:\nWe propose and simulate a linear-optics, measurement-based protocol that exploits the zero-energy corner modes of a minimal 2\u00d72 second-order SSH Bloch Hamiltonian to teleport a single-photon qubit from corner node 0 into the target corner mode at node 3 via Bell-basis measurements on the two interior links. By using only probabilistic photon-pair sources, single-photon emitters and post-selection\u2014and remaining fully functional even after removal of one interior source\u2014the scheme demonstrates topological protection of fidelity in corner-to-corner quantum state transfer.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Hybrid-Frequency Triangle-Network Nonlocality Test with Photonic-Resonator Joint Measurements\n\nMini-abstract: We propose a self-contained three-party triangle nonlocality experiment in which two optical and one THz probabilistic Bell-pair sources feed three nodes arranged in a loop, with node B employing a small photonic-resonator interferometer to mix optical and THz modes for heralded two-outcome joint measurements. Encoded entirely in the Pytheus framework using beam splitters, phase shifters and number-resolving detectors, the scheme allows optimization of local measurement phases to maximize violation of Fritz\u2019s triangle network Bell inequality in a mixed-frequency architecture.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Photonic Tree Tensor Network Classifier for Four-Qubit Boolean Functions in PytHeus\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a depth-2 photonic Tree Tensor Network (TTN) isometry that cascades two levels of entanglement-swapping modules to map four input qubits (leaves) onto a single output qubit (root), explicitly targeting the Boolean classification f(x0,x1,x2,x3). Implemented in the PytHeus framework, our scheme uses only probabilistic photon-pair sources, tunable beam-splitter reflectivities, ancilla detectors, and removed_connection constraints to enforce the binary-tree topology without dynamic feedback.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Generalized Six-Photon SWAP-Test Projection of Two Atomic Triplets\n\nAbstract: We implement a static 6\u00d76 fiber-coupled interferometer that performs a genuine multi-copy SWAP test by projecting the joint six-photon state from two atomic triplets (target quantums E0,E1,E2 and E3,E4,E5) onto their symmetric subspace.

    "input": "You are a helpful AI physicist. \n\nTask: \nYour colleague (the 'Expert') has access to a tool (pytheus) that can design quantum optics experiments based on a clear target. Your task is to provide your colleague with an interesting target to search for. Interesting means that the experiment applies into a new domain or combines known and modern quantum techniques in new (potentially unexpected) ways. But make sure it is suitable for pytheus. This target should be a new kind of quantum network (complex multi-node networks and their fundamental physics questions, modern questions and techniques for quantum networks, and applications and generalizations of entanglement swapping and teleportation). Avoid targets tailored to quantum computing and quantum error corrections.\n\nIdeally this would be an idea for an experiment that can be generalized and expanded upon beyond a single experimental setup towards a whole range of diverse but related experiments. Crucially (!): The idea that you define should be interesting independent of whether the experiment is actually implemented -- your goal is to provide such an convincing idea that your colleague (Expert) can find the experimental implementation using pytheus, and write a cool theory paper (for instance in the journal Phys.Rev.Lett.).\n\nHere is some additional information on the capabilities and limitations of pytheus:\n\nCritical Information About Pytheus:\n1) Experiment Generation: Pytheus can generate experimental setups for concrete quantum networks (e.g., generalizations of entanglement swapping) and foundational quantum optics experiments.\n2) Abstract State Encoding: Pytheus encodes quantum states abstractly. For example, the state |0>+|1> has no inherent physical implementation\u2014it could correspond to photon polarization (a discrete 2-dimensional system) or orbital angular momentum (a discrete high-dimensional system). However, this physical encoding is not part of Pytheus\u2019s output and must be specified by the experimenter afterward. Consequently, suggestions involving hyper-entanglement or hybrid-entanglement cannot be meaningfully interpreted by Pytheus, as it operates purely on abstract quantum state descriptions without reference to their physical realization.\n3) Limitations in Feedback Control: Pytheus cannot design experiments that require dynamic feedback control, including many quantum error-correction systems.\n\n\nYou will be given some paper abstracts as initial inspiration. You can decide for yourself which ones are actually interesting to you. Give a short comment on them and if they could be useful for your task.

In other words, we want to create a state that is essentially the tensor product of three independent Bell states, one for each pair of qubits:\\n\u03a8AD\u2297\u03a8BE\u2297\u03a8CF\\n\\nEach \u03a8XY\u03a8XY\\u200b is of the form \u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9\u222300\u27e9+\u222311\u27e9 (without normalization), where XX is one qubit in the first party\u2019s group, and YY is the corresponding qubit in the second party\u2019s group.\\n\\nPutting this together, the desired target quantum for the six qubits (A, B, C, D, E, F) is:\\n\u03a8ABCDEF=\u2223000000\u27e9+\u2223001001\u27e9+\u2223010010\u27e9+\u2223011011\u27e9+\u2223100100\u27e9+\u2223101101\u27e9+\u2223110110\u27e9+\u2223111111\u27e9\\n(without normalization).\\n\\nThe setup we aim to construct uses probabilistic photon-pair sources. Each source can emit photon pairs, but we must ensure that no single photon-pair source directly connects the two parties. To enforce this, the configuration uses the removed_connections keyword to exclude certain edges. These edges represent unwanted connections between detectors on opposite sides. For example, connections from the qubits in the first party (A, B, C) to those in the second party (D, E, F) are removed:\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n[[0,3],[0,4],[0,5],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]\\n\\nHere, the numbers 0,1,2 correspond to A,B,C and 3,4,5 correspond to D,E,F. Removing these connections ensures that no source can simultaneously produce a photon pair directly linking the two parties, thereby mimicking the idea of entanglement swapping.\\n\\nTo achieve this entangled configuration, ancillary photons must be introduced. The number of ancillary photons is specified in the num_anc field. These ancillary photons are measured by a third party. By performing a joint measurement on these ancillary photons, it is possible to create effective entanglement between the two parties, even though there is no direct pair source connecting them.\\n\\nIn a standard scenario, attempting to non-locally entangle three qubit pairs independently would require a larger number of ancillary particles.

This only needs single-photon emitters, one ancilla pair source, a static tritter/beam-splitter network, number-resolving detectors, and post-selection.  \n    2) Heralded SWAP has been covered in \u201cheralded Fredkin\u201d and related gate-teleportation examples.  \n    3) Multi-sender dense coding is interesting but requires decoding of two independent classical messages via a joint four-photon projection (effectively a Toffoli or higher) which is complex and may reduce to known post-selected Toffoli gates.\n  Step 3: Pick the MDI-QCKA via a GHZ analyzer.\n  Step 4: This idea is novel because no previous Pytheus experiment realizes a three-photon GHZ-basis measurement for conference-key agreement. It elevates entanglement-swapping to a real cryptographic protocol rather than mere state generation.  \n  Step 5: It is feasible in Pytheus because it uses only static linear optics, three single-photon inputs (the parties\u2019 qubits), one probabilistic Bell-pair source (ancilla), number-resolving detectors, no feedback, and post-selection on a GHZ projection click pattern.\n\nAction: final answer\nAction Input:\nDescription:\nDesign a measurement-device-independent quantum conference-key-agreement protocol using a post-selected linear-optical GHZ-basis analyzer. Three parties (Alice, Bob, Charlie) each send one single photon (their qubit) to an untrusted central node. The node mixes these three photons plus two ancilla photons (from one Bell-pair source) in a static linear-optical network (beam splitters/tritters), then reads out a six-click detector pattern that unambiguously projects onto one of the eight three-qubit GHZ states. Whenever the central node obtains a \u201cGHZ0\u207a\u201d outcome (post-selected via a unique 4-click signature in ancillary detectors), the three parties know that k_A\u2295k_B\u2295k_C=0 and can extract one shared key bit. By randomly choosing preparation and sifting bases, they realize a full MDI-conference-key-agreement protocol immune to detector side-channel attacks.\n\nPytheus config sketch:\n{\n  \"description\":         \"MDI conference-key agreement via linear-optical GHZ analyzer\",\n  \"foldername\":          \"mdi_qcka_ghz_analyzer\",\n  \"single_emitters\":     [0,1,2],        # Alice, Bob, Charlie input photons\n  \"num_pair_sources\":    1,              # ancilla Bell-pair for GHZ measurement\n  \"anc_detectors\":       [6,7,8,9],      # used to herald a GHZ0\u207a projection\n  \"removed_connections\": [[0,3],[1,4],[2,5]],  # no direct input\u2192wrong ancilla\n  \"num_pre\":             1,\n  \"num_anc\":             4,\n  \"edges_tried\":         50,\n  \"loss_func\":           \"cr\",\n  \"optimizer\":           \"L-BFGS-B\",\n  \"samples\":             20,\n  \"thresholds\":          [0.3,0.1],\n  \"number_resolving\":    true,\n  \"safe_hist\":           true,\n  \"imaginary\":           false\n}\n\nVisualization:\n  Emitters: [0](Alice) [1](Bob) [2](Charlie) + pair-source \u2192 [3,4]  \n  Static tritter/BS network mixes modes 0\u20135  \n  Detectors: [5](GHZ output) + ancilla detectors [6,7,8,9]  \n  Post-select on the unique 4-click pattern \u2192 herald GHZ0\u207a.  \n  Parties then reveal basis choices and distil a shared key bit from each heralded event.\n\nGoal:\nShow how nonlocal GHZ correlations, harnessed by a measurement-device-independent GHZ analyzer, implement a full three-party quantum key-distribution protocol\u2014with a static, post-selected linear-optical network and no state-generation focus.

Just like with the previous lists, a novel idea should also not be too similar to the ideas from this list.\n\nHere is the list of ideas from the researcher ensemble:\n\nSTART OF LIST OF ENSEMBLE SUGGESTIONS\n\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Ancilla-Only Entanglement Swapping via a Discrete Squeezed-Reservoir\n\nAbstract: We introduce a purely network-level primitive in which two SPDC sources generate entangled pairs AB (modes 1\u20132) and BC (modes 3\u20134), and a third SPDC source at Bob produces a \u201csqueezed-reservoir\u201d Bell pair (modes 5\u20136) that is weakly coupled via beam splitters to Bob\u2019s system modes 2 and 3. By performing photon-counting only on the ancilla modes and conditioning on coincident clicks, Alice\u2019s and Charlie\u2019s remote modes 1 and 4 are projected onto the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9\u2014effecting entanglement swapping without ever measuring Bob\u2019s system qubits and preserving local memory for subsequent quantum network operations.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Passive Spatial-Multiplexed Entanglement Swapping on a Nanoscale Waveguide Chip\n\nAbstract: We demonstrate a fully passive on-chip architecture for entanglement swapping in which k probabilistic photon-pair sources on each link (A\u2013B and B\u2013C) are coherently funneled through fixed multiport coupler trees in a nanoscale waveguide to boost the heralded Bell-swap success probability without any active switching or feedback. The experiment specifically targets entanglement swapping between end nodes A and C, post-selecting the Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 with a success rate scaling as 1\u2212(1\u2212p_source)^k.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle:  \nHeralded Entanglement Swapping in a 2D Non-Hermitian Topological Lattice\n\nAbstract:  \nWe implement a purely static linear-optical network\u2014a 2\u00d72 near-neighbor non-Hermitian photonic lattice with engineered loss and beam-splitter couplings\u2014to perform topologically-protected, heralded entanglement swapping between corner boundary modes via interior ancilla sites E and F.  Post-selecting two-click coincidences at E and F heralds the target Bell state |00\u27e9+|11\u27e9 on boundary modes B (node 1) and D (node 3) (quantum nodes [1,3]), demonstrating robust heralded Bell overlap against moderate beam-splitter reflectivity and loss disorder.\nidea suggested by ensemble:\nTitle: Measurement-Induced Photonic Realization of the Three-Qubit Cyclic SWAP Ring-Exchange\n\nAbstract: We propose and optimize a heralded linear-optics network that implements the nontrivial cyclic-shift unitary U_cycle: |a,b,c\u27e9\u2192|b,c,a\u27e9 via entanglement swapping and Bell-measurement\u2013induced teleportation on a three-node triangular topology.

Whenever the central node obtains a \u201cGHZ0\u207a\u201d outcome (post-selected via a unique 4-click signature in ancillary detectors), the three parties know that k_A\u2295k_B\u2295k_C=0 and can extract one shared key bit.
